1 : Ok I'm going to
1 : shore up these two.
2 : Good move.
1 : Then we got one and (these are cancelled)
3 : Mm.
1 : Can I use my powers twice in one play
2 : Yes.
1 : (--) well I guess yeah cause (I don't)
2 : Well the Pilot's limited to once per turn.

2 : If we have any sandbags we're gonna use them while these were getting shuffled.
1 : 
1 : (--) discard this into the treasure
1 : Um and I guess they have to, they're still picking two cards I guess.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : That's the worst part. It starts out easier but then it starts sinking faster and faster.
1 : So Iron Gate and phantom Rock.
3 : Iron Gate um...
2 : That's the Iron Gate and phantom Rock.
3 : Oh ok.
3 : Phathon Rock, oh aww.
1 : Aw, oh my gosh.  ok.
2 : Oh sinking already.
2 : Alright. The phantom Rock Card gets removed.
3 : I guess the phantom Rock.
1 : Oh yeah. That sucks.
2 : Foruntately it's not critical. No Treasures on it and it's not a path to anywhere.
2 : Ok now that was your turn. So I can take up to three actions.
2 : (We're) on the Lion. I'm gonna move one.
2 : oops that not sunken, why am I trying to...move two

3 : Lost.
1 : Oh.
2 : And Whispering Gardens.
2 : Alright that's it for my turn.

2 : Ok.
2 : One action left.
3 : Um.
3 : then.
3 : Move here.
3 : And then move
2 : Wait isn't using your power an action?
3 : Yeah one action.
2 : So you need one action to move, one to shore up, and then one move is what I'm asking.
3 : Um,  there's not much I can do, so
2 : third action
2 : Not at this point. We need to get matching sets for treasures before the island sinks.
3 : (it's) another Helicopter.
3 : that and two Flood Cards.
3 : Um Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.

2 : Um, I'm gonna shore up the Temple of the Moon.
2 : I got two of these. I kinda want to stay there right now. Nothin' else I can shore up so I think I'll only take one action.
2 : I'm gonna go to six cards now so I'm gonna go ahead and use Sandbags to shore that up.
2 : Oo Water's Rise that's not good.
2 : Six up one.
3 : Oh did you only take one Treasure card?

3 : Oh you have to discard. One, two, three.
2 : Well you could immediately use either Sandbags or Helicopter Lift.

2 : Oh yeah you definitely want to use it cause I drew a Water's Rise.
3 : Use this to save that?
1 : Hhhmm.
2 :

1 : Oh um oh this is a little tricky. I have so many cards to give and no one to give them to because I'm a million miles away.
3 : Oh um I can use Helicopter Lift and move you to our side.
1 : That would just be gorgeous (--) ok and then so I guess that counts as one move for me.
2 : Mm. Helicopter Lift does not that's not an action so you still have all three. That's one, that's two.
1 : Oh ok. Alright, so one and two. Um.
3 : Awesome.

3 : Tsss, oh and I only have one Helicopter card.
1 : (laughs ) Ooo fun.
3 : And I can move myself.
2 : You can fly to anyone, but we're gonna need to be helicopter lifted off that side of the island.
2 : Get off Fool's Landing.
2 : Ok so that was your turn.
1 : Yes.
2 : I gotta rock.
3 : Oh we're actually, I think we're good. Cause we only need one more.

1 : Hmm.
1 : Yesh. Oh we'll figure it out (--)

1 : Well.
1 : yeah I mean you could use your two moves like to go here and wait ah sorry.
2 : No I want to stay with you and use one Helicopter Lift cause
1 : Well I'm saying she does like two moves to get here and she can flip this over and then she would only need one more.

2 : Well...
2 : that's
2 : hold on.
2 : two.
2 : And flipping over three flood card
1 : I don't know.
2 : Cave of Embers

1 : Three
1 : Cave of Shadows
1 : I'm
1 : Dunes of Deception
1 : And Copper Gate
3 : Copper Gate ok.
1 : Still (--) now.
2 : That's up there.
3 : Ok.
2 : Ok so I'll claim this treasure.
2 : And then
2 : So that's one move right?
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Yeah.
2 : So this is another one and then we can shore up this.
1 : Ok.
3 : Alright.
2 : One. Two.
3 : Try to be on the same isalnd so I can fly you guys over.
2 : Oh.
1 : We can both try to get the Cave of Shadows and then claim the last one.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Ok.
3 : Cause I'm gonna try to
3 : Cause I'm after her so if you guys are on the same island, I can do helicopter lift and move you guys over to that.
1 : Um
1 : Yeah ok.
3 : Is it my turn?
2 : Yeah cause I didn't get it.
3 : Is it my turn?
1 : Did you take the two?
2 : I think so
2 : Yeah (--)
1 : (hello)
2 : You have to draw these ones, ok.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
3 : Did you do three actions?
2 : I didn't
2 : Yeah but I didn't draw Water's Rise card (--)
3 : Ok.
2 : Um Howling Garden.
2 : Cave of Embers
3 : Oh they're Howling
2 : And
2 : Iron's Gate.
3 : Mm. Alright so I'll do Sandbags.
3 : Does this count as, this doesn't count as one turn right?
2 : No.
1 : Oh.
3 : This I'll do that.
3 : And then.
3 : I'll probably.
3 : Turn this one over.
3 : And then
3 : Oh here.
3 : Ok and then three.
3 : Thank you.
2 : Hmm
3 : Ah Observatory Watchtower and Misty Marshes.
1 : I don;t really have five cards.
2 : Oh.
2 : Hmm.
3 : One, two, alright so.
3 : Um.
3 : Misty Marshes.
3 : Watchtower and then observatory.
1 : Ok.
1 : So I'll move.
1 : Here.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : And
2 : You should probably move.
1 : Um.
2 : Two so you could
3 : yeah.
1 : Can you move two?
2 : Which
2 : Yeah.
3 : I don't yeah you can move yourself.
1 : Ok.
3 : So she'll have to move next to you.
1 : And then so so my third move will be
2 : MMhmm.
1 : To capture the fire.
3 : Ok.
3 : That's good.
1 : And then um
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
1 : (--)
1 : Of couse.
3 : Uh oh.
1 : And then.
1 : Discard those to the treasure pile.
1 : And I take three.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Observatory.
1 : Dunes of Deception.
1 : And Watchtower, right there.
2 : Ok and.
1 : So you just have to move yours up to that one.
2 : Right.
3 : Yeah and then I can fly you guys.
1 : You (played)?
2 : Yeah.
1 : (yeah)
2 : Um Cave of Embers.
2 : Cave of Shadows.
2 : (--) on.
3 : Ah.
3 : My turn?
2 : Yes.
3 : Ok, so I'll do Helicopter Lift.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Fly you guys over and then I'll fly myself over.
3 : ok.
3 : We're done.
3 : No.
1 : 
1 : 
3 : There's more.
3 : Everyone must move their pawns.
3 : discard 'em
3 : Oh ok, so my third one we will fly you guys off.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Ok

1 : Ok.
1 : Um.
3 : Ok Engineer.
1 : So.
1 : I guess like I should try to shore up as much as I can cause that's what I'm best at.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : So I can shore
2 : Yeah.
1 : These two.
3 : Ok.
1 : And move over here and shore up these two.
1 : Which is like
1 : A bit of saftey I guess
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : And then can I get
1 : two treasure cards
1 : Opp.
1 : Alright.
1 : I got a Water's Rise.
1 : Um.
1 : Alright so
1 : bump this up.
1 : And then I draw two flood
1 : tiles
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Yeah but there is no
3 : There's none.
3 : Oh there are.
1 : Oh there is a discard pile.
2 : 
1 : You tricked me.
1 : Alright, I'll just...
1 : Shuffle it off a bit
1 : Alright.
1 : And then draw two.
2 : Two.
1 : Which are the Lost Lagoon and phantom Rock.
1 : So Lost Lagoon.
1 : And we lost
3 : phantom Rock
1 : We lost phantom Rock.
2 : We lost phantom Rock.
3 : ok.
1 : That doesn't really, I don't think that does anything.
1 : So
2 : Oh it's ok.
1 : This one goes back and I think this is put...
1 : in to the...
3 : Oh we have to put the Phantom Rock over here.
1 : This one's right at the end.
2 : Yeah.
1 : I don't think it matters that Phantom's Rock is gone though.
1 : Cause like it didn't do anything and it was at the edge of the board.
3 : Yeah.
2 : No.
1 : Alright. So your turn.
2 : Alright.
3 : Alright and you have two of them.
3 : Ok.
2 : Hello.
2 : First move.
2 : I'll meet you there.
3 : Ok.
2 : Um.
2 : Can't shore up.
2 : If I gave you...
2 : If I gave the Engineer Ocean's
2 : Chalice
1 : (--)
2 : Would that.
1 : I mean it might help but you could also do that without being on my square.
2 : Cause you have that one.
2 : Yeah.
3 : It'd be better to give him a card then.
3 : That's to us.
1 : I think it makes sense to kinda like
2 : Well you have two fires already we can only have five
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : So.
1 : (yeah)
2 : I'll hold on to it for now.
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : I don't think there's really
1 : I think that there's nothing to do really except like shore this up cause
2 : (--)
2 : Yeah I can't really
1 : I think we don't have enough treasures to make anything happen.
3 : So you could move again.
2 : Yeah.
1 : So yeah I would move.
2 : Um.
1 : Go down to Breaker's bridge and shore it up, cause I don't think there's anything we can do.
2 : No I can't do, I can't do diagonal.
1 : No, no, you just go down, cause you still have two left.
3 : No.
3 : It's adjacent.
1 : I don't think there's anything like
1 : to do this turn cause we don't have any treasures.
2 : Ah just mo-I'd move there.
1 : So that's one.
2 : ready
3 : You can move one more time.
1 : And then you can move once more and shore it up.
2 : Oh ok.
2 : Ok.
2 : Alright.
2 : And that goes (now).
2 : Alright that's it for me.
1 : And then you got like two treasures
2 : Oh yeah.
2 : Let's see.
2 : Earth Stone and Sandbags.
3 : Ok.
3 : Does he
2 : And
1 : You got.
3 : Oh.
2 : I guess.
1 : You got.
1 : Just.
1 : Draw two of them or don't we?
2 : Yeah.
2 : Ok.
2 : Cliffs.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and Breakers.
1 : Alright.
2 : See, Cliffs.
2 : Breakers.
2 : Ready.
1 : That's really good.
2 : Alright.
2 : Yep.
3 : And you're on it.
2 : Ok.
2 : Then discard.
3 : Hey just so you guys know I have the Helicopter Lift so at any time I can move one or more pawns to another tile.
1 : Mm hmm.
3 : I don't think that there's anything.
1 : I don't think there's any urgency.
2 : Ummm.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Oh yes.
3 : Um.
3 : Probably, I should move here.
1 : I think.
3 : And get him up?
2 : Um.
1 : Yeah, I think it kinda makes sense just like shore these two up because we've got
1 : We don't have enough treasures to do anything.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
1 : I think.
3 : So that's one.
1 : I don't know.
3 : No.
1 : That's two.
3 : Two moves, I can also
1 : And then that's three.
1 : Cause you moved once.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Oh that's.
1 : Ok it looks like everything's like
1 : We have less
3 : Shore it up.
2 : Just, just one and we're in.
1 : Yeah we have less floods than we started with.
3 : Alright.
2 : Yeah.
1 : And that piece doesn't really matter.
1 : (--)
2 : Yeah we're good.
3 : Ok, now we just have to think about
3 : getting our
3 : right cards
2 : Yeah.
2 : two.
1 : We just have to worry about treasures for now.
2 : Two treasures.
3 : Ok.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Right, I have another helicopter lift.
2 : But
2 : Alright.
1 : Ok.
3 : The fire
3 : Do you have my flood card?
3 : Ok, Gold Gate and Whispering Garden.
2 : Ok well this one's out.
2 : And.
3 : Ok.
1 : Oh oh well.
3 : Whispering Garden.
2 : Whispering Garden.
3 : Ok.
1 : Alright.
1 : Um.
1 : Ok.
1 : Ahh.
1 : Maybe I should start heading to like..
1 : This or this.
1 : cause
3 : Mmhmmm.
2 : Mm.
1 : I have two of these so when I get like
1 : You have one and then if I get the last one that I can just (--) it up.
3 : Alright.
1 : So what if I like.
1 : Shore up.
1 : What
3 : Whispering
3 : (Oss)
3 : Oh.
1 : Oh.
2 : Oh yeah.
1 : Oh I think you removed
1 : the wrong one maybe.
2 : Yes um.
3 : sorry
2 : Oh this one, this one stays cause that one's gone.
2 : This yeah
1 : Alright, so I think I should shore this up.
2 : yeah.
1 : One.
1 : Two three.
1 : And then like, I'm closer here.
1 : She can give me that next turn.
2 : And we only have three so.
1 : Say it.
2 : (--)
3 : But also I have two helicopter lift cards so I could move you to one of these islands anyway.
1 : I don't think
1 : But we can save them.
1 : Wait there's no are they, alright, alright so one
2 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Two.
1 : Three and then next turn you can give me that and I'll have three.
3 : MMhmm.
1 : And then.
1 : Can I get the two treasures?
2 : Yeah.
1 : So if I get like a third fight.
1 : Yeah right perfect.
2 : Alright sweet.
3 : Got it.
1 : One two
1 : alright
3 : Ok.
1 : Ok so that when
1 : Oh that kinda sucks.
2 : Oh now you have to wait another turn to do that then
1 : Yeah.
1 : Hmm.
2 : Alright.
3 : Oh yeah we got one of these and
3 : One of these but
2 : Yeah.
1 : Right.
1 : Ah and then
2 : Yeah I think
2 : Yeah that's your fourth
1 : (--)
1 : The Temple of the Moon
1 : And the
1 : I'mm
1 : (--)
1 : That's over there.
1 : Alright
2 : Alright.
3 : Mk.
1 : So that's it.
2 : Let's see what my strategy is, um.
2 : It's easy to bring me back next turn.
3 : Yeah.
3 : What's your special power?
2 : Ah give treasure cards to the player when
2 : an your on the island.
3 : Mk.
1 : So yeah I think for now just like shore things up
2 : Um, well I need to meet up with you then cause you can't give me cards anywhere.
2 : I can give you cards anywhere.
1 : Yeah.
2 : RIght.
1 : So what if?
3 : Yeah but he can;t give any more cards.
3 : Oh.
1 : I get it.
2 : Well yeah no I'm not giving them any but he but I have to be on the same one as him for me for him to give
3 : MMhmm.
3 : Ok.
1 : So I guess
1 : Yeah I mean
2 : I'll just move there.
1 : And then while your there you might as well shore up.
1 : Cave of Shadows
2 : I think that one isn't.
2 : Is it?
1 : Oh is that?
1 : That's right side up.
2 : I can't tell if it's yeah ok.
1 : Wow there's like nothing for you to do that's so funny.
2 : um.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Alright that's it.
3 : Ok.
2 : Oh wait, no, no, no, I'm gonna use this.
3 : And you took the
3 : You're gonna shore that?
1 : No that's already shored up.
2 : Um, I'll shore up this one.
3 : Good.
1 : You just get that.
1 : Is, is that an action though? Oh that didn't
1 : And then say special actions don't count as that.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Sp
1 : That doesn't count as an action.
3 : Oh yeah, Helicopter and sandbags.
3 : doesn't count as
3 : an action
2 : Yeah.
2 : Ah that's ok.
1 : Ok.
3 : But you can still
2 : I don't, I don't need to, I don't need to use an action
1 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
2 : But
3 : Ok.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Alright.
3 : Ah
3 : So I could fly all of us some place I don't think I need to do that, you don't need to move yet right?
1 : Yup.
2 : Oh.
1 : I dont' think you can give that to, oh yea you got to get your treasure.
2 : Hold on, hold on, I need to...
2 : I always forget to do that. Ok Water's Rise.
3 : Oh.
2 : so three this time
1 : Ok.
1 : Wait, wait, wait, we gotta shuffle them back in.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Can't shuffle them like a normal deck of cards
2 : Ok we got
2 : Breaker's Bridge, Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.
1 : Iron.
3 : Iron Gate.
1 : Iron Gate.
2 : Whispering Garden and then Breaker's Bridge
2 : there.
1 : Ok.
2 : Ok.
3 : Tt.
3 : Ok.
3 : I should fly to a different island and...
3 : Get these back.
3 : Shore them up again.
3 : Right?
1 : I don't
2 : Um, yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : I think you can just, you can just shore them up without using the lift thought.
1 : Oh. yeah.
3 : Then no. I can, I can fly anyway.
3 : The
1 : Oh, right, right.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Did it sss
1 : That's two
3 : Two.
3 : Three cause I'm gonna hold off giving you a card.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : I got.
1 : A couple too many.
3 : Alright.
3 : Ahhhh.
3 : Anything else?
2 : All of them are shored up.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Um then you just have to...
1 : (--)
1 : Yeah I think we're just collecting treasures and just keeping things shored up for now.
3 : Ok, I gotta a sandbag.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Everything's shored up.
2 : (Duh)
3 : And one of these
2 : Yes.
2 : Yeah.
3 : So I next move I give you
3 : Earth
3 : Then to give you that one.
3 : Ok um.
2 : Three of these.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
3 : Let's just hope
3 : for
2 : Wait
2 : Ok.
3 : Yeah.
1 : It's three of them yeah
3 : That's three.
2 : Ok
3 : Alright, Lost Lagoon
3 : Cliffs of Abandon and the Temple of Moon
3 : um.
1 : Cliffs of Abandon right
1 : No.
3 : Go ahead
1 : And
2 : Then
3 : And then Lost Lagoon
3 : Over there.
2 : Alright.
3 : Ok.
1 : Great.
1 : um.
1 : So I'm gonna give
1 : this to them
1 : Oh you have six cards you have to
1 : Get rid of one.
3 : Do these count?
1 : Ah I guess so...
1 : Um.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Ok.
3 : I'll get rid of
1 : I think you should get rid of the sandbag
3 : Yeah cause we don't need that
3 : Good thinking
1 : Am
1 : Oh wait can we get rid of tre-are there more of, if there more than four of a kind of treasure which there must be I think it's kind of safe to get rid of treasures
2 : There's probably eight.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah Ithink it's safe to get rid of like.
1 : You can get rid of
1 : a treasure
3 : Are there more than four of these?
1 : There must be the deck is huge.
3 : Alright.
3 : Willing to take that chance?
2 : mm. Ha, ha, ha.
1 : Yeah I think so.
1 : Let's go for it.
1 : What could possibly go wrong?
3 : Yeah I don't know.
2 : Might be at the bottom.
3 : Yeah we could hit the bottom because
1 : Sandbags seems better.
2 : Well we have two.
3 : This is the one we need right?
2 : Two oceans, three earths, four fires
1 : To be honest, I think you just might want to get rid of the fire.
1 : Cause like
1 : Odds are by the time
1 : it gets
1 : back around to someone
1 : We'll have drawn another one
1 : And you can just use the sandbag
1 : no
2 : mm.
3 : So what you're saying is we should assume that there's more there but if there's not
1 : Well like the deck is huge, how could there not be.
3 : then we're
3 : I don't know
3 : Ok.
2 : No but we
2 : If she gives you that one then we get rid of all
2 : all four of those.
2 : When we get the treasure.
1 : Oh the other thing is if we
3 : Because I could fly and if we could all get on the same one then I could fly us
3 : Here.
1 : Yeah.
3 : And then.
3 : We could have that.
3 : Treasure off.
2 : Yeah and all those cards would be gone.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : And that right.
1 : Yeah.
1 : What's
3 : I think
1 : Oh Gosh.
3 : Yeah I think it's better just to start getting treasures off the island
2 : Yeah.
2 : Awesome, yeah get stuff out of the way.
1 : Ok yeah I think you should.
3 : Better safe than sorry
2 : And then we won't have to worry about
1 : Yeah I guess just get rid of the sandbag then.
2 : THen we won't have to worry about either of those to tiles to shore up.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Because this one it seems that
1 : I think we're already shoring everything up fine.
3 : (--) anyway.
3 : Yeah.
1 : That's kind of
2 : Yeah.
1 : Ah if I, if I'd been thinking though like if I'd play this (--)
1 : You could have just given me this anyway and then I could have gotten rid of
1 : these two
1 : cause I'm sure there are a ton of them, the deck is like, it's like a hundred cards
2 : yeah
3 : ok you know what, we're gonna find out
2 : alright
3 : probably by this next time
2 : yeah, let's let's keep going
1 : alright
1 : So let's see
2 : 
1 : Ah I'll just
1 : Ok I'll just give you a card actually, I'll give you
2 : Yeah then I'll be, then I'll be at max
1 : this
1 : What do you need?
1 : this
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : And go here
1 : Oh
1 : And then I get two treasure cards
1 : if one of them's a fire then we already have enough
3 : then we'll see what's goin' on
1 : nope
1 : I got six like so I got to get rid of one of them
2 : Um
1 : we'll get rid of
3 : he's good
3 : we could
3 : we could now have four of these
2 : either this is
1 : alright so I'll get rid of
3 : the chalice
2 : it's up to chance so either one
1 : get rid of the chalcie
3 : yeah
1 : it also said that we only had to have
1 : three of them right so we could just kind of
1 : chose a treasure to abandon
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : right now
1 : so we should just go for this and this and I guess the gold ones
2 : um
3 : well actually we would have had
3 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : we probably should have gotten rid of this because then we would have had two and it would hav ebeen easy to get rid of the third one
3 : Does that make any sense
3 : you could
3 : oh
3 : you would have had three
2 : um
1 : yeah
1 : it does
1 : oops
3 : ok
3 : it's ok
2 : oh it's ok
1 : we're fine
1 : I think we're gonna win
1 : Ah
2 : Twenty one
3 : we have twenty one minutes plenty of time
1 : Copper Gate
1 : is
1 : there
1 : Crimson
1 : Forest is there
1 : And Howling Garden
2 : Howling Garden
1 : Alright it doesn't matter if the Howling Garden gets flooded also cause this one's closer
1 : And it's at the edge of the board so we're not going to be crossing through
2 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : Alright you're theres
3 : um.
1 : Right.
2 : Its yeah ah um
3 : Oh
3 : 
2 : Let's see
2 : Should I
1 : I kinda like the idea of
2 : Hmmm
1 : Right now you use your Helicopter lift
1 : to fly yourself there
3 : ah huh
1 : And then he spends his turn just giving you these two
2 : he has five cards
1 : yeah but if he used the Helicopter
1 : Oh
3 : yeah
3 : well actually if I used the Helicopter lift then it would go off
1 : Oh you still have six
3 : And then I'd yeah
2 : You still have one
3 : But I'm
3 : And then I'd only have three I wouldn't have four
3 : You're the one that's gonna
2 : yeah we need to focus on the fire
3 : yeah
1 : I'm on the fire with three of them so you just have to give me one
2 : yeah
3 : Uh huh
1 : When it's your turn
3 : and that's gonna be my turn
2 : And then you can get rid of one of those yeah
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Wait, you're here now?
2 : So
2 : Can I just shore up?
3 : Well the only way you could shore up is to move one two
2 : I can do
3 : or one, if you move over here then can't you shore up that one?
3 : Cause it's adjacent?
1 : Yeah maybe you should go one two and then shore this up to make sure this doesn't flood.
2 : cause
2 : yeah cause this one
2 : if this one
2 : get us um
2 : um
2 : I forget what you call it
1 : No this is still shored up
2 : Yeah, yeah but if the chance we lose this one, we won't be able to get to this one.
3 : this one's ok
1 : yeah
2 : So
1 : Yeah I like going there cause you can still give
2 : If I do that, ok
1 : things long distance
2 : yeah
2 : Yeah.
2 : Alright
1 : this
2 : two
1 : ok
2 : three
1 : we'll grab two treasures
3 : there's
2 : water's rise
3 : one and three
1 : Water's Rise, i gotta shuffle these in.
2 : yeah shuffle, alright yeah I'll get rid of this one.
3 : yeah.
2 : Breaker's Bridge, Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden
1 : Whispering Garden
3 : Lost Lagoon.
1 : Lost Lagoon is lost.
2 : Lost Lagoon.
2 : Ok.
1 : And
2 : Um.
3 : And what was the other one?
2 : Breakers
2 : Bridge
2 : Where's that?

1 : No we need you to give that we need you to give me this
3 : Ok.
1 : this turn
3 : I oh no no
1 : But you have to be
1 : you need to be on my square though
1 : So
3 : Um
3 : if on smae
1 : You can (show)
1 : so I think you can shore up one of these and then fly over to me then give me one
2 : Yeah
3 : Alright, it's a good thing you got all that done
1 : So I think shore up the
3 : Alright this one or this one
1 : Shore up thisone cause it's a treasure
3 : Mmhm.
3 : One.
1 : Then fly to me
1 : two.
3 : two.

1 : rid of the yellow one
2 : Um.
1 : This is what we don't have four of right now.
2 : Yeah let's do that
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : So
1 : Get rid of that
1 : Alright.
3 : Ah
3 : (--)
3 : And then I can use the Helicopter Lift and get you
3 : Over here since you got all four
1 : I'm supposed to be here
1 : I have to be here this is when we have all when we have
3 : Oh but then oh we all have to go
2 : Yeah
2 : That's when we have all of them yeah
1 : but you should use your Helicopter Lift and go somewhere.
1 : Um.
1 : Because you're gonna have six cards after you draw
2 : yeah you're gonna have two
3 : Alright then I should
2 : Um.
3 : Move some place where I can shore up one of these
1 : So maybe go like here where you can shore something up but you aren't in danger of drowing. A
3 : Alright
3 : Or
3 : This one
1 : Or actually wait you can go on top, yeah I like that
3 : or
3 : Do we need this one?
2 : We have
2 : I think this one
1 : yeah I think go here go here
3 : Ok why this one?
2 : Yeah.
1 : Cause it doesn't matter if this sinks
1 : Cause we're still gonna have
1 : This tile to get rid of our
2 : Well you just have to be careful because Whispering Garden is in the top
1 : our winds?
3 : Right.
2 : So.
3 : Yeah.
1 : But the thing is like it does- like if she goes here and it goes under she just ends up here anyway it's like fine.
2 : Ok.
1 : So there's just like a slight maybe benefit maybe.
3 : Alright.
2 : Yeah.
1 : you can't
1 : shore it up
2 : we'll see
3 : wait, wait do I have to
1 : you can't shore it up, you're out of actions

1 : Swim to
1 : An adjacent place and it's up to you which.
3 : Alright, I'm gonna swim to

1 : I guess we just put them in the discard pile?
2 : Um.

1 : and then this is my third
3 : Ok.
1 : Right two treasures
1 : Oh this is really convenient
2 : Oh ok Yeah
3 : Yeah I know.
1 : Cause you can just give me those two and then I'm already here
1 : Ok ah, three.
1 : Cave of Embers
1 : So both the moon and Crimson Forest
1 : is gone.
2 : and we lost that.
1 : But, who cares.

3 : Um.
1 : Ok.
2 : Alright is that it?

3 : Ok.
3 : this one?
1 : Yeah, shore this up and then
2 : Yeah.
2 : So that's one.
1 : Could you just give me those two green ones, when it's my turn next I can just
2 : Um
1 : Pack those away also
2 : Can I do multiple? Give treasure cards to, it says cards.
1 : Alright.
2 : A one action per card ok so if I gave you both then I'd be done.
1 : So then you're
1 : Yeah and then
2 : Um done, do I need
3 : Do you need any other actions?
1 : Nope, everything's shored up except Cave of Embers and it doesn't matter if that goes under cause we already got this.
2 : I don't think so.
2 : Oh yeah, ok
3 : But
3 : Oh
2 : Alright so I'll do that, one, two, three from the end.
1 : Alright.
2 : And then
2 : Oh and then
2 : that frees me up
3 : Mmk.
2 : And then
2 : Coral Palace, Dunes of Deception and Coral Gate.
1 : Silver Gate
2 : Coral Palace
1 : Coral Palace
2 : Um the yeah.
1 : Dunes of Deception
2 : Did we lose one?

2 : Alright.
3 : Alright.
3 : Move here so I can shore this up.
2 : Um

3 : That's one.
1 : That's two.
1 : Opp.
3 : Um.
1 : And then.
3 : ttt
1 : What if you just fly oh what if you just go here and then next turn he gives you these two?
3 : And then I shore
2 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Alright.
1 : yeah I think we're gonna win in like a couple turns.
2 : Alright.
2 : We have twelve minutes still.
1 : yeah.
3 : Alright.
1 : So you got your two.
2 : Yeah.
3 : I'm gonna be.
3 : Alright and I have too many cards so I can
3 : discard these
1 : You can get rid of this one.
1 : cause we have
1 : red, we're gonna get green
3 : ttt
3 : ok.
1 : And then you're gonna get yellow next so purple doesn't matter anymore.
3 : Neither of these matter. This one doesn't matter either.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.

2 : Yeah.
1 : Alright.
1 : Cool.

3 : Temple of the Sun and Bronze Gate
2 : And Bronze Gate
2 : Alright
3 : Alright
1 : Alright
1 : So I turn it these four
1 : Ahhh
1 : That's one
1 : Ah
1 : I don't think there's anything
3 : Do we need to shore up anything else?
2 : um.
1 : I don't think there's anything left for me to do, I think I can just kind of hang here now right?
1 : And just wait for you guys to end the game in a couple turns?
3 : Alright.
1 : That was one, I might as well just do two.
1 : Three
1 : Just
1 : to be safe
3 : Just to be safe
2 : Yeah
1 : Just to be safe
2 : Ok.
1 : Perfect.
3 : Just we've got alright
1 : Alright.
1 : Ah
2 : Alright
3 : Two
1 : Two treasures
2 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : A Helicopter and a water's rise
2 : Oh perfect
1 : Bump it up to three.
1 : Ok.
1 : Silver Gate
1 : its
1 : gone
1 : There's those two.
1 : Whispering Garden
1 : And Temple of
1 : the Sun which I shored up
1 : so that
1 : is
1 : a good thing
2 : that's good.
2 : Alright so I'm giving you
2 : Well you have five cards don't you
3 : He's got
1 : Yeah but she doesn't care about the green one.
2 : Um
3 : And he's got a Helicopter Lift also so I could get
2 : Ok
3 : oh.
1 : Oh wait, wait wait.
1 : Shore this up just to be super safe maybe?
3 : That's me.
1 : Yeah wait, alright, I so
1 : If you go one
3 : If he moves there
1 : Shore it up and then move here
1 : then we're super safe and then she can just give those to you instead of you to her
1 : cause you're on the same square
2 : She can only give me one.
1 : No she can give you two.
3 : Unless I have two.
1 : That's two actions
2 : Oh ok right. One action. Ok.
3 : I have two turns left.
1 : Are you on the same?
1 : Yeah.
1 : So
2 : So that's one
1 : One
1 : Sure
1 : Yeah cause that's our last gold one
2 : And then
2 : Three
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok.
1 : That's good.
3 : Mmk.
1 : I gotta draw.
2 : Um
2 : I have four.
1 : You can get rid of
1 : the green ones
2 : Yeah.
1 : (Who's going?)
3 : Oh you have three of those?
2 : I have two, oh no I do have three, oops
1 : Oh um
1 : (--)
1 : Just go to the other green one too
2 : No.
2 : And then three.
2 : Alright, Temple of the Moon, Tidal palace
2 : Dunes of Deception
3 : Tidal Palace
2 : That's Tidal yeah.
2 : Alright, your turn.
3 : Ok.
3 : Ultimately I have to get us all.
3 : Over here now.
2 : Yeah we have here and then we have to have a Helicopter Lift.
3 : Right.
3 : First action.
1 : Huh
1 : Yeah that's good.
3 : K.
1 : That's me.
3 : Oh.
1 : Oh well you can use the Helicopter Lift then.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Oh I think you should
3 : No, no, I think we all want to end up over here.
2 : Um
1 : Wait, I think so, I think the plan is if you just fly to me right now, that's two.
2 : Yeah.
1 : And then you can just shore one up or something?
1 : And then when it;s my turn
1 : I'll lift us back over
1 : cause we can us-we can use the lift at any time actually
2 : Well we have three
2 : We have have three so
3 : We have three Helicopter Lifts
1 : Yeah so we have plenty of time I think just
1 : Fly over and shore up like
1 : Dunes of Deception or something
1 : And then
2 : We might as well just beat this one
1 : Well that's two, so you can only shore up one of them
2 : Yeah
1 : And then
3 : I guess I'm just wondering if we
2 : Um
1 : If
3 : We don't really
1 : What I'm thinking is if we end up on the same square then we win instantly when it's his turn
3 : mmhmm.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : Cause
1 : He takes the treasure
1 : and I helicopter lift us both over there
1 : And you Helicopter lift us both over there and then you lift a third time
3 : Ok.
3 : That's two.
3 : This one?
1 : That's
1 : Sure.
2 : yeah.
3 : Three.
3 : And another Sandbag
3 : And Chalice
2 : (--)
2 : i think you just get rid of both of those
3 : This
1 : Just
1 : Used it, you can use it
2 : Or one of them
3 : Well we can just use this
2 : Oh yeah
1 : Sandbag right now
2 : Yeah
3 : And
1 : Just to be safe
1 : Just
3 : I don't know it doesn't really matter
1 : Back up an ran-back up any random one.
2 : whichever
3 : there we go
3 : three of those
3 : Coral Palace
3 : Cave of Embers
3 : And Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Here it is
3 : Alright
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : (--)up yeah over here.
3 : Nope those are over there.
1 : So I'll go
1 : One.
1 : Two.
1 : And then
1 : Three to end up back with you
1 : Just shore stuff up
1 : I get two treasures but
1 : I don't think it does anything
1 : Ok.
3 : Ok.
1 : And then
1 : The three Floods (--)
2 : Yeah
3 : Mm.

1 : Misty Marsh
1 : Breaker's Bridge and Bronze Gate

1 : So you grab
1 : That
2 : This
1 : I helicopter us over
2 : yeah.
1 : And then
2 : Um.
1 : You can just lift the three of us over here and then lift us off the island.
1 : So I guess we won.
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : Alright.
2 : Yeah.
1 : And with five minutes to spare
2 : Water's Rise
3 : he still has to do yeah
1 : No we can you can lift when it's not your turn

2 : No I have to use my actions
3 : I would I would be (--) you do it
1 : It'll be faster if you she sends them to you cause that's the last treasure and then we can all
4 : Yeah if I get 'em? Ok.
2 : Yeah cause your turns coming next.
4 : That's true.
3 : And
3 : away after.
1 : Yeah then we can all start making it to Fool's Landing.
2 : Ok.
4 : Ok.
4 : So
3 : Yeah
4 : You get one of these well.
2 : Yeah just you don't need anything.
4 : Should I keep? Doesn't matter which one
3 : Yeah just get rid of those.
1 : Yeah we don't need them
4 : Oh yeah
2 : Well you can have five cards thought so just keep one.
3 : Just keep one.
4 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
4 : I'll keep this one.
2 : So pick
3 : Yeah I keep that one.
4 : No there's no way to get it
2 : Then I get two and then
2 : One two three.
2 : Breaker's Bridge.

1 : Ah it's still good though/
2 : Oh (--) yeah sorry.
1 : So we can't do that.
2 : Um Silver Gate.
1 : Dumb.
2 : It's ok.
3 : Yeah (--) doesn't really matter.
2 : Howling Garden.
2 : Oh that was a winner.
1 : (that's gone)
2 : Whispering Garden oh good those don't really matter at all.
3 : Ok.
2 : (--) move that way now.
2 : Um and now I need four, oh I did that.
2 : So your turn.
1 : Alright.
1 : Ah.
3 : Ok so I'm just, I guess I'm gonna use this now since we're almost done.
1 : Yeah.
3 : So.
1 : And then
3 : I'll just do that one that we're on.
4 : Do it on the one that they're on yeah.
1 : Yeah and then I woudl just fly here and then be done.
2 : Yeah.
4 : (--) yeah I would do that to.
3 : Yeah I can also. This doesn't even have I have two of these so should I just use one to fly someone there now?
1 : Cause then.
2 : Well does anyone else need
1 : Ah you can fly her there.
4 : Or save one (--)
2 : Only he needs to stay there.
3 : Cause it's not.

1 : We'll fly her there. We need one to leave so.
2 : Yeah me.
3 : Yeah.
4 : Yeah.
3 : Ok so cause that's not even a turn.
1 : Yeah
3 : And then I don't really need to do anything else.

2 : Alright now you get
1 : You move`
4 : One
2 : Over there.
1 : Get that.

1 : And then
3 : Well we gotta yeah
1 : Just
1 : Go over
2 : Well three you move over
4 : Yeah.
4 : yeah three of them move back over
1 : Alright
4 : Here.
1 : So
4 : Two
3 : And then two
1 : We need
1 : Two Treasure Cards
2 : Water's Rise.
3 : We need three treasures and then
2 : This
2 : Shuffle the discard pile.
2 : So what you're red right?
1 : Yeah I'm just moving and then she can use a Helicopter Lift and we're done.
2 : And then
2 : Well on my turn I won't do anything. Oh I have to take three of (--).
1 : Well she can use Helicopter Lift immediately and then we win.
4 : Yeah.
2 : Can you?
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Yeah.
2 : So
3 : I can use both.
4 : So four.
1 : Alright.
3 : (--)
2 : Yeah we take four first.
3 : Like
4 : Right ah Cave of Shadows
4 : Coral Palace.
4 : Observatory and Watchtower.
4 : Um
3 : Really
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yup.
1 : Alright
2 : Right.
1 : So none
1 : I move
4 : (--) card.
2 : And then you fly us home.
1 : Use that
4 : That's it right?
1 : And then one where we're out.
3 : Ok
3 : Yay
2 : Yay (--)
3 : Is that?
2 : So what do we do?

1 : Ok
1 : so my first two actions- or my first action will be to
1 : shore up these two adjacent tiles
1 : then
1 : um
1 : I'm going to move
1 : one over
1 : and um I can
1 : give any cards but I can shore up again.
2 : Yeah
1 : And I'll shore up these two.
1 : Ok, can I get two?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Thanks.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok, so um I have a Water's Rise card.
1 : Uh
1 : so two
2 : Do you have to shuffle these first?
1 : Oh yeah
4 : Mm
1 : Did not think we'd be starting with the discard pile.
1 : One
1 : two
1 : So Phantom Rock and Breaker's Bridge
4 : We just lost one.
3 : It's right here but it's already flooded.
1 : Oh, I flipped that one, that's the one we lose then.
4 : Oh, ok
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, that's gone and that's gone.
1 : Ok
1 : discard this and that goes in the other pile.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : um
2 : Well
2 : What, what do you guys think I should do?
4 : Uh we don't
2 : There's not all that the
4 : really have enough cards to get any kind of treasure.
2 : (--)
2 : Right, so I can move
2 : here
4 : Yeah
2 : and then shore up.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : That's probably a-
3 : Ok
2 : That
4 : I think that's the best move honestly, until we have
2 : and then um
4 : cards.
2 : Should I, should I move somewhere else
1 : Um
2 : or just stay there?
1 : I don't know um
1 : Pilot, you're close enough that you could move
1 : and shore up the Gold Gate during your turn if you wanted to, so you wouldn't have to fly there.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Um, I don't think there's a reason for you to give me a card right now
1 : because I have two fire crystals.
2 : Right
2 : um
2 : (--) then I guess I'll just
4 : You could move and I could give you this earth thing. The earth card thing.
4 : Maybe. I don't know if we wanna try to do that or not.
2 : Um
2 : you- I don't think you can give me a card.
4 : Mm like if you had moved here and then on my turn I would move here and then give you a card.
2 : Oh
2 : oh
1 : Yeah
2 : I see
1 : Or you could just fly to his space, you could do it.
4 : Hmm
1 : Well no, he, he'd have to give it to you, yeah.
2 : Or I could give you this card.
4 : Oh yeah, I guess that's true. Alright.
2 : Here I'll just give you this card.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : So then
2 : you get two of these
2 : and then I have to draw
1 : (--)
2 : two
2 : no
4 : (--) on the same island tile- but isn't she the Messenger?
3 : Oh
2 : I'm the Messenger
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Oh ok
2 : Ok
2 : Alright, now I draw two flood cards right?
2 : Or no
1 : Did you draw two treasure cards?
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, I drew two treasure cards.
1 : Oh right, you gave him the- ok
2 : And then I draw two cards right?
2 : Because we're on two
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yes
2 : Ok
4 : (--)
4 : Wait, do we have to shuffle the things back in right now or no?
1 : That's only if you get a flood card.
2 : No, only if you get that card.
4 : Ok, ok.
2 : Ok, so Gold Gate. Oh yeah, he's gone.
2 : And Whispering Garden- which we are standing on.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : so
3 : what do you guys think I should do ?
1 : Um
3 : Should I
3 : move close to yours and flip yours back over or
1 : I mean we're already here
4 : Yeah but
1 : So- Oh right, cause- We could- Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : We don't
4 : Yeah
4 : And that just got played and so if we get
4 : a uh
4 : flood tile thing in- or flood card in the next two turns- yeah
3 : Yeah the rise thing
4 : Plus I don't see like what other actions
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : I also can't use this
2 : if that were to sink because it's in the discard pile.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
4 : Oh ok
3 : So just go ahead and do that.
4 : I think so.
3 : Ok, um
1 : Yeah
3 : should I move to
3 : something that has a treasure on it or should-
3 : Cause this one doesn't, so
3 : Wait
1 : Um
4 : But you can't
4 : shore up adjacent things anyway. Or you can't shore up diagonal things.
3 : Um right here, should I move right here?
4 : No- I don't
1 : Um, I don't think it matters which one of these
3 : Ok
1 : you move to, just because we don't have enough to get a treasure right now.
3 : We don't have one of thsoe anyways- Ok.
4 : Yeah
1 : The only thing would be if you wanted to give us a card, you'd have to move to this one
1 : which
3 : Ok
4 : Well you only have three actions anyway so even
4 : if you walked here you couldn't
4 : give them cards.
2 : She can fly
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah
4 : Oh that's right, that's right.
4 : Yeah I don't think it matters.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok, I'll just um
3 : move here then
3 : and then flip you guys over
2 : Ok.
3 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : and then I'll have to use
3 : all three of my actions, so
2 : Nnmhmm
3 : I don't see why
3 : I would.
3 : And then I pick up two of these right?
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : K
3 : Thank you.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : So, we're flooding Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon.
3 : Mmkay.
3 : Thank you
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Alright
4 : uh
4 : I can't flip
2 : Well
2 : Yeah ok, never mind, sorry
1 : Yeah
4 : And then
4 : I kinda wanna stick around one of these, either this thing or this thing because
3 : Mmkay
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Stay- Yeah. You should stay there because I can then give- I can give another one.
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : Right, right, right
4 : Alright, thanks.
3 : Ok
4 : Thanks
1 : Ok
1 : so
1 : you definitely wanna keep that up.
1 : So
1 : yeah I'll use my two actions to move
1 : to
4 : Wait, wait, wait
1 : (--)
4 : hold on a second.
4 : Let's just think about this for a second.
4 : Uh
4 : cause it's won't be very hard. I'll only need one action to move this up right?
4 : But you're gonna need
3 : Mmhmm
4 : all three of your actions to move it up
1 : Mmhmm
4 : but I- That's true, you're right. I don't know if it'll like go anytime soon.
1 : Yeah
1 : or, or we could use
1 : the sandbag but I don't see a reason
4 : Yeah
1 : why
3 : Yeah, and there's always this one too.
2 : You
4 : That's true.
1 : Yeah
3 : And I could like- I have a Helicopter though so I could fly one of you
3 : to that one if you guys
4 : Oh, ok
1 : Yeah
3 : whenever we need to do that.
4 : I do wanna give you this fire thing at some point though.
1 : Ok
4 : I think that's important so we should
4 : somehow try to get our pawns closer together.
1 : Mmhmm, so then it would be- Misty Marsh would be a good place for me to be.
4 : Yeah
1 : So it'd be one away from you.
4 : Yeah, so I guess flipping this thing over is good and plus
4 : What- I
4 : Ok, I think it's a good move then. Cause we have people close enough, we can probably flip that next turn anyway.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
4 : Ok
2 : Ok, so what're you gonna do?
1 : Yeah
1 : so I'm going to move two
1 : and then for my third action
1 : shore this up.
2 : Ok
2 : good.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok, Water's Rise.
2 : No
2 : fun
1 : Hooray
2 : Fun
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : The good news is even if we lose one of these two it's not
1 : a treasure.
1 : Ok
1 : and then
1 : discard
1 : that
2 : K
1 : And the mm
1 : (--) ok
2 : Alright.
2 : So I'll- my first move
4 : Uh
4 : we need to draw the water cards now right?
4 : Or do we not
2 : Oh, you're right.
4 : Yeah
2 : Oh shit
1 : Ok, so I draw another
2 : sorry
1 : three
2 : Goodness.
1 : Great
1 : Breaker's Bridge,
4 : Alright
1 : Temple of the Moon, and Whispering Garden.
4 : We didn't lose anything.
1 : Alright
4 : We did Temple of the Moon, this is Breaker's Bridge.
1 : and
2 : Oh this (--) ok
2 : um
2 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : so
2 : first
2 : I'll give this to you
3 : Explorer
4 : Ok
4 : hold on.
2 : I'll, I'll give that to you.
4 : Ok
4 : so that means I have to definitely discard a card?
2 : Oh, do you not want it then?
4 : so that's ok.
3 : Oh
4 : I don't know
4 : I don't know
3 : Oh, I see. Yeah, maybe you should hold onto that cause you only have
4 : Mm
2 : You want me to hold onto it?
2 : Alright
4 : Well then let's just think about it for a second,
3 : Because
4 : I really don't- Cause we have
3 : Yeah a lot of those
4 : four lions right? Which means we can get that card. Four fires, which means we can get that card.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : We only have three (--) right now.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah, just- I would just keep it.
2 : Ok
4 : So yeah, yeah, I guess that's a good idea. And we need to
4 : like we need to trade I think, yeah.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : so
4 : Uh
2 : what- basically I should shore up something.
3 : Yeah
4 : yeah, I think so.
2 : But
2 : what
2 : should that something be?
4 : Uh
3 : Well have you done an action yet?
3 : So you have
2 : I haven't done anything.
4 : No, she has three actions.
3 : Ok, so
3 : can you shore up this one?
4 : Do we wanna use a sandbag?
3 : Already, no
3 : Yeah, I forgot you had that.
2 : Um
4 : I was just thinking like, like she can definitely shore up
4 : these two, right. And then a third action would just be a movement
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
4 : but then I wouldn't
4 : (--) anything else and then the sandbag we don't have to use an action for. I'm just wondering if we should use it
4 : I kind of feel like, I don't know, why not. You know what I mean?
2 : Well the thing is
2 : that I
2 : um
2 : you can't use- you can't- you can shore up a tile before it sinks but it can't be used if the flood deck card for the sinking tile is already drawn. So this is already here, so I can't do that.
4 : I see.
4 : Ok
3 : Mm
2 : That's the one rule that I
2 : don't like
1 : Well, no, I thought that was if you draw them both in the same turn
1 : you can't use it to save it if it's going to
1 : go.
4 : Yeah cause then- Couldn't we never use the sandbag
1 : You can still- You can use it right now, but if the next time we draw flood cards
1 : there's one for this one in that
1 : group, you can't use it then.
2 : Ok, so if we break a rule
2 : does the game end?
4 : (--)
2 : I'm just asking, I don't know.
1 : Um, I thought so, no?
4 : If we break a rule, I don't know
2 : If we break a rule, does the game end?
3 : I think so
1 : Ok
3 : No
3 : ok
1 : so I wasn't sure, I think
1 : I think we might have screwed up before
1 : I don't think you draw the flood cards again after you put them back on top of the deck.
1 : Are we allowed to clarify that?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : You can fly yourself
1 : Ok
2 : So we did it right then?
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
3 : Sandbags can shore up any one tile
1 : Ok, cause it went up to three and then- ok
2 : Ok so then can you use the sandbag card if, if the
4 : So
2 : water card is here?
2 : Ok, so I know what my interpretation of that is but
4 : It's already drawn
1 : Yeah
2 : What do you guys think?
1 : I mean based, based on what they were
2 : You disagree
4 : But wouldn't that mean we could never use the sandbag? The only way things sink is if they're drawn- how
1 : Right
3 : Yeah
4 : Isn't that kinda weird?
1 : I mean, based, based on what they said on the video, I'm pretty sure they just mean you can't use it the turn
1 : it's like you got a Water's Rise, you draw it, and then
2 : Well if you, well if
2 : you could use it if
2 : the, these got- say these got shuffled back in
2 : and this didn't get drawn again
3 : Oh
4 : Oh
2 : then I could use it.
4 : Alright, I kinda see
2 : So
3 : Um
4 : I think that interpretation's correct.
2 : ok
2 : so I could um
3 : This
3 : Ok
4 : Alright, so you can shore up two tiles pretty much, when you're on the one adjacent to you.
2 : Right, so which one, which ones do you want me to- So I'm gonna shore up this one?
2 : Yeah
4 : That's probably good, yeah.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, since it has the treasure on it, yeah.
4 : Cause we almost
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok, and which other one?
4 : Uh
2 : I'd probably say the, the one in the
4 : Breaker's Bridge, yeah.
3 : Yeah
2 : towards the middle? Ok
4 : Yeah cause a lot of ones on the side are like
4 : we don't really need them.
2 : Mmkay so I have two of these
2 : then I have to draw three.
3 : Ok, now we have four of those out.
4 : We have four (--)
2 : Ok, Iron Gate
2 : What's gonna
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : (--) and Lost Lagoon
1 : Nad that's gone.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok, so
3 : I think that I should give this to you.
4 : Yes
1 : Ok
4 : but you guys have to be on the same
1 : Yeah, you have to be on the same space as me to do that.
3 : Mmhmm, oh I do, ok how do-
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : Um where are you at?
4 : You are blue
2 : You're blue.
1 : I'm here so you could
2 : So you can fly-
3 : Ok
4 : Two
1 : yeah if you wanna fly to my spot.
4 : Oh yeah that's- Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : And then that way you could also
1 : if that's your one action and then you could-
1 : No you could shore up one of those two
3 : And then I can give it to you.
2 : And then you can shore up- I would shore up that one probably.
4 : Oh nice
4 : It's good.
3 : Yeah so I'll do this
3 : And then I'll flip this over
3 : and then I'll give this to you.
4 : Awesome, ok and then
1 : Ok now I have five
4 : So on your turn I'm gonna give you this flame thing anyway
4 : Right and I guess we can sacrficie the chalice?
1 : Yeah
4 : and that way you can
4 : get a card when it's your turn- should be able to.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : yeah and I have to give you the wind statue.
3 : Wait you don't necessarily have to
1 : eventually.
4 : Fuck, you're not close enough yet though.
3 : sacrifice it though, you can give it to one of us, cause I don't have
1 : Yeah, that's true.
4 : Oh, but look
4 : If I give him this card
4 : on my turn he has to sacrifice it cause he'll have six and he won't be able to like give it to anyone else, yup
3 : Oh right
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : Mm
1 : But I'm not sure you wanna do that just yet cause I still have to be on one of these spaces to get it.
4 : That's true.
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok so um
1 : Unless you wanna airlift me to it.
3 : I have to pick up two more of these right?
4 : Oh that'd be so good.
3 : And I- So I pick up two of these
4 : I think that's such a good idea.
1 : Uh huh
1 : Well we'll see, she can use it on your turn.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : And you have
1 : aw you don't, never mind.
3 : Ok so we're sinking Howling Garden, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate
3 : Copper Gate
3 : uh
1 : Uh huh
3 : Ok
3 : Thank you
2 : (--)
2 : Alright so (--) Explorer
3 : Mm
4 : Ok
4 : Alright
4 : so I do think we should probably get rid of the chalice right, we only need three out of the four things, we have four fire and four earth and four air
3 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
4 : I don't think the chalice really matters
4 : At this point
4 : uh I'm probably gonna move here
4 : give you the fire card,
4 : sacrifice the chalice
4 : shore up- I guess I'm gonna shore up the Copper Gate.
1 : Ok
4 : Wait
4 : ok
2 : Not three right?
2 : Three actions
4 : Yes, that's three, so now we can do
4 : the uh
4 : flood.
1 : Doesn't he have to draw treasure cards first?
4 : No
1 : Or did you do
4 : I don't think so.
3 : Mm no he didn't draw yet.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Thanks
4 : Water's Rise
3 : Beautiful
4 : Yeah
4 : That sucks.
3 : At least we didn't go up a level
1 : Yup
1 : Just prepare to lose one of these.
4 : Alright
4 : Copper Gate,
4 : Howling Garden,
1 : This one
4 : Ok
2 : Dang it
1 : It's gone.
2 : (--)
4 : So that's lost, alright.
3 : Ok
1 : And the Bridge
3 : That's not too bad.
4 : Yeah and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Yeah
1 : That's ok, we just can't lose this one, or else it's over.
3 : Yeah no
4 : (--)
1 : Right
4 : I really did not think we were gonna lose stuff so fast.
1 : Ok so now it's my turn.
1 : So
1 : first things's
4 : Ok so
2 : Wait a minute
4 : Do we wanna
4 : do the helicopter thing and send him to one of the fire places and then
4 : uh
4 : he can get the treasure?
4 : Because the cup would only be one action right?
3 : Yeah
2 : I was gonna say what if he shores up these two?
1 : Yeah I need to do that first.
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : And then flies.
4 : Ok
2 : And then um
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Or
3 : Um how can he fly?
1 : Well
1 : you have the Hel-
2 : You have the Helicopter card.
1 : Cause the thing is, is
3 : Yeah but I have to wait for my turn right?
1 : I thought we could use it at anytime.
2 : No you can use them at anytime.
3 : I can use anytime? Ok.
1 : And since that doesn't count as an action
2 : Well I was also gonna say
1 : um
2 : if you want to
1 : Yeah
2 : you can shore up that one as well.
2 : Alright.
2 : Or no you can't shore diagonally, never mind.
1 : No
2 : Alright
4 : Are we sure it can be used at anytime?
1 : Yeah.
3 : I'm not.
1 : Uh, I thought
4 : Ok
4 : I don't really think it says- What does the card say?
1 : Special action cards
2 : action
3 : Oh it does say play at anytime.
4 : Oh special action cards
4 : Ok
4 : that's fine.
3 : We're good.
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : so
2 : Ok
1 : Ok yeah so I'm gonna shore up
1 : these two
1 : Ok
1 : and then you're going to fly me to which one?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Which one should I go to?
4 : Which one's more likely maybe mm
1 : I was thinking this one cause it's close to the bridge but
4 : Because then you can shore up that?
4 : I like that idea.
1 : What do you- do that anyway on your turn? Ok
2 : Yes, I would.
2 : Because I don't really have much to do.
3 : It's also close to the
4 : But look
3 : this.
4 : I was gonna say this is like a nice little cluster of all the treasures, so if anything starts getting flooded
3 : so
3 : yeah
1 : Yeah
4 : it'll be easy for you to shore things up when you're near there.
1 : that's a good point. That one is only near a, a chalice,
4 : Yeah
1 : but this one also is.
2 : And we're not going for that.
3 : Yeah
4 : And this is the only place we have the wind statue thing now
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, ok
2 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
1 : that's a good point.
1 : Oh so that's only one of my actions
2 : (--)
2 : Ok
3 : Oh
2 : There we go.
1 : For my second I'll trade these in for a treasure
2 : K
3 : Cool.
4 : Cool.
3 : Yay
1 : Um
1 : and then I could, I could move.
1 : Should I move
1 : just here so I'm ready to do that next time?
2 : Um
3 : I mean you can if you want
4 : Maybe
3 : it's not like we
3 : need to be on this anymore.
2 : Well here
2 : or
2 : or
2 : do
2 : Mm see you have a lot of the
2 : cards.
3 : Yeah, so
2 : He could give you
2 : this and you can discard your fire card.
1 : I can't, I'm not on the same space as him.
4 : You're on the same space.
2 : Oh shoot, sorry, I keep- Like it's my power, I keep forgetting.
3 : Right
1 : (--)
4 : So
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
4 : It might be better if you're
4 : here, just because
4 : if anything gets
4 : potentially- like potentially flooded or whatever, you have
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, you have the ability to flip over more things, shore up more things.
1 : Yeah cause this
1 : right now, these- this is (--) protect that and
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : Yeah, that's good.
1 : Ok, so I'll move here for my last one.
3 : That's good.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, so two treasure first.
2 : Ok, we only have fourteen minutes left.
1 : Ok, I have a Helicopter and a lion statue
2 : Wow
4 : Alright, well we got our first thing, we just need two more.
1 : I draw three
1 : Ok, Crimson Forest, Cliffs of Abandon, Whispering Garden.
4 : Right.
4 : Oh we're gonna need to shore that up.
2 : Uh it's my turn next I can do that.
4 : Ok
4 : uh, Cliffs of Abandon is here
1 : Yeah
1 : And Crimson Forest is gone.
4 : What else did you say? Crimson Forest
2 : Ok go for it.
4 : Crimson Forest is gone.
1 : Yup
2 : (--)
4 : Oh it is gone, ok
3 : (--)
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : I guess, I guess if we draw a flood card for something that's already gone we just take it out of the deck right?
1 : And discard it
1 : or would that not happen?
1 : I guess I'm
2 : Wait, what was your question.
4 : It wouldn't happen. It shouldn't happen.
1 : Cause the, the treausre deck is big enough that there's more than four, but there's not more
1 : than one
1 : flood card in here
1 : for each
1 : thing.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : so
2 : would it be beneficial
2 : for me to give anybody any cards?
2 : Probably not.
4 : Uh
1 : (--)
4 : Well look
4 : I don't need this fire, right?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm, yeah, especially since we already have it.
4 : If you give me an earth
4 : and then you give me an earth
3 : Uh huh, yeah
4 : we should be good
3 : That sounds good.
4 : I think, ok
2 : Ok
2 : So
4 : Oh crap, I'm gonna lose one of these. Well that's fine, he has a couple. Cause I'm gonna- I wanna see how- If
3 : Well
4 : if we do that I'll end up losing one of these lion things.
3 : Yeah, that's, that's fine. Cause I can give him one
4 : I still think it's ok, cause he has (--)
1 : But we yeah we have more than four.
2 : Ok, so that's, that's action number one.
3 : Wait, wait, wait
4 : Ok- Oh that's gonna go in the discard, ok.
3 : Uh
3 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
3 : Huh, interesting
2 : I'm going to shore up
4 : Where- Ok
2 : this one
4 : One
3 : Mmhmm
2 : and then I should just shore up another one.
2 : Which one, this one?
4 : Yeah, I would say so, yeah.
2 : This one?
1 : Yeah, cause that one's a good connector.
2 : Alright
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : So I will shore up this one.
1 : Ok
4 : Fantastic.
2 : Ok
2 : Two cards
2 : Oh
2 : Well look at that
1 : (Gray)
2 : Um ok so which one should I discard?
3 : Oh that's nice.
1 : Just (--) it
4 : That's interesting.
1 : Um
2 : This one, right?
4 : Can we sandbag anything?
4 : No we can't
3 : Well we don't
4 : We just-
1 : We could do the Bridge.
4 : Breaker's Bridge isn't in there, right?
4 : Is it?
1 : Oh right I
2 : Yeah it is.
4 : Oh ok
2 : So I should discard
2 : this because she's gonna give you that.
3 : Yeah
4 : I think
4 : that is a good idea, yeah.
2 : Right?
2 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright
2 : I'll discard that and then
2 : (--) us three of
2 : Ok
2 : Uh Temple of the Moon,
1 : Mmhmm
3 : I need to give like each of you one of my cards.
2 : Um the Cave of
2 : Embers
2 : and Silver Gate
1 : Ok
2 : which is this one.
4 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : So we can sacrifice this thing now.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah we can
1 : Yeah we can- we don't care.
4 : Like that doesn't matter anymore, yeah/
2 : Um
2 : Right
1 : Ok
4 : And potentially- ok
3 : Alright
1 : Now just, just so you know, because you can use flying as one of you actions, and we both have a Helicopter Lift, if you wanted to
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
1 : we could move you somewhere to give him the cards and then you could go somewhere else if you needed to
4 : (--)
2 : They're already on the same spot
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : Oh, never mind.
2 : which is good.
4 : Right
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : So
3 : Ok
4 : So, I'm gonna discard this thing.
3 : And I give you this.
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Great
2 : Ok
4 : Thank you.
3 : Ok
3 : So
3 : did that take one of my actions then?
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, that's one of your actions
1 : Yeah
3 : And then
4 : So you have two.
3 : Let's see
2 : I would
2 : shore up the Temple of the Moon.
4 : Yeah
2 : Just so he can get
1 : Mmhmm
2 : on the next turn so he can get it.
3 : Ok
4 : Then well I guess you can shore up Silver Gate too
2 : Mmhmm
4 : I don't see why not.
3 : Right, but should I give this to him
3 : on this turn?
4 : I don't think you can. You have two actions and it takes two movements to get to him.
1 : I mean, she can- she's the Pilot. She could fly if she
3 : I mean I can
2 : (--)
4 : Oh that's right, I keep forgetting that.
3 : Yeah
2 : But that does take one of your
1 : Yeah, I think it's better to protect this one
2 : actions.
4 : Flying takes action.
2 : Yes.
1 : Yeah flying takes
4 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
2 : I think that
1 : Unless we used a Helicopter Lift card
2 : we need to save
1 : I'm not sure if you would want to.
4 : Ok
4 : We could- Ok, we could sacrifice thing and then lift me over to the other side.
4 : I don't know if we wanna do that or not.
3 : Ok, but we need to flip this over now.
4 : I don't know what's faster.
2 : Yeah
4 : Ok, that's fine.
3 : Ok so
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : we'll flip that over, so that's the other action.
2 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
3 : And then
3 : should I just move to
2 : Wait, wait
3 : what?
2 : You- Can you fly
2 : someone else, or just yourself?
3 : I can fly someone else with this but
2 : Oh but you could
4 : Oh, like we could do it for free then she could trade with him and that'll be her last action?
4 : So what you thinking?
2 : Um (--)
3 : But I think it would just be
4 : I don't think it's a bad idea.
3 : better to move to him.
4 : You
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah, that's fine.
4 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Um
4 : But you
4 : you cannot move diagonal, like you're not gonna get over there in time.
1 : But she can fly there.
3 : I mean I can fly there.
4 : Oh that's right, sorry
3 : Ok
3 : so
1 : Ok
2 : K so you're done right?
3 : Yeah
2 : Is that three? Ok
3 : So I pick up two of these
3 : Ok
3 : Thank you.
3 : Let's see
3 : Dunes of Deception,
3 : Coral Palace, and Bronze Gate.
4 : Ok
3 : Cool
4 : One,
4 : It takes an action to get the treasure right?
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
2 : Two
4 : Thanks. Two
4 : uh
4 : I'm just gonna shore this thing up I guess
2 : Um
1 : He can do that diagonally.
2 : Well
4 : Yeah, I can.
4 : Do we just want me to run back to
4 : Fool's Landing already?
4 : (--) whatever you- What's the last thing we're getting.
4 : We could either get
4 : the wind or the chalice
2 : I also have- Yeah, I have these three.
1 : Yeah
4 : Right
1 : Uh
3 : For your last one you can give
3 : them that.
2 : I'm not on the same tile. I keep forgetting that.
4 : Yeah we're not on the same tile and we're not- yeah we're not close enough.
3 : Oh- yeah that's
1 : Yeah
3 : That's a thing.
2 : I keep forgetting that.
1 : I mean, again I could- If you wanted me to fly you, I could do that.
2 : Ok
4 : Oh, ok
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Um
4 : Yeah but look, even if you flew me over
4 : and I gave you this thing, you still wouldn't have enough, yeah.
2 : You don't have four.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : So
1 : So there's no point.
3 : It would be more beneficial if like
3 : Wait who has- who else has the green- I do, ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So you should just
2 : shore up
4 : Ok
4 : that's fine.
2 : the thing I guess
1 : Ok
1 : So now it's my turn.
2 : Alright
4 : Alright, let's see.
2 : I- you- I know what you're gonna get.
4 : Thanks.
4 : No
2 : It has to be
4 : I didn't get
2 : Aw sweet
4 : Yeah
2 : Oh good, ok
4 : Yeah
2 : Aw crap
4 : Thanks
3 : Eight minutes
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah
4 : We got two
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah we're gonna get
2 : Ok
1 : So
4 : Damn
2 : So where- you're right there right? So you can shore up
1 : Yeah what makes the most sense?
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Ooo yeah
2 : two right?
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
1 : If I put
4 : So you could
1 : What would be best then is if I move to here
1 : and shore up the two with these treasures on them
4 : Cna you do this, like one move, two move, three move?
4 : Or no
1 : Um
1 : so
3 : We need to flip this over, right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Right, so yeah, since he's on that- so that would be flip that over, move here, and then flip those two over, right?
1 : Which
4 : (--) just in case I think is a good idea
1 : Oh
4 : Right
4 : I think it's the most efficient thing to do.
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : You can
4 : you can
4 : do that though right? Like it's not just tiles you're adjacent on?
1 : Yeah, cause these aren't diagonal.
4 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : and then, so that's one.
4 : Two
1 : Two
4 : And then three
1 : three.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : That one too.
2 : Ok
1 : K
1 : one
1 : Oh no
4 : They got another Helicopter though, so that's good.
1 : ah
1 : forgot.
2 : And nobody's on a sinking tile,
2 : which is awesome.
1 : Yeah.
2 : The only person that would be safe
2 : would be you.
1 : One,
4 : Me? Oh yeah.
2 : Yeah, cause you can go- Or if that's where- you could move diagonally. Nobody else could do that.
1 : Two
4 : I can move diagonal, yup.
1 : Three
1 : Ok, Temple of the Sun,
1 : Temple of the Moon,
1 : and Copper Gate.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok, so we didn't lose anything.
4 : Alright
3 : Cool.
2 : Alright
1 : Hooray.
2 : Alright so it's my turn.
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
2 : I
4 : So we can't
4 : use the sandbags now, right?
4 : Because there are cards in the deck, I think, so, yeah
2 : We can,
2 : we can, yes.
1 : Yeah
2 : so
4 : And those are free actions and like
2 : True
4 : you have five cards.
2 : Right
2 : so
4 : Oh yeah
2 : these
2 : we don't really care about these because we already have the treasure.
4 : I don't think so.
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Right
2 : And so the only one I can't do is Copper Gate.
4 : Ok so we could do
3 : Which is fine.
1 : What
2 : So do you want me to do this one?
4 : Yeah, I guess that's good.
4 : I just feel like
4 : you might end up with all four chalices, you know what I mean? If
2 : Right
4 : Maybe
4 : I don't know, they're just free actions, you know what I mean? I feel like we might as well use them.
2 : aYeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so, so I'm gonna do that one.
4 : Ok
1 : Well, hold on, before you
1 : Don't we also want the
4 : Mm
1 : Oh never mind, ok, sorry
4 : Ok
2 : Um
4 : Ok what do we wanna do now? Do we wanna move you to the chalice thing just in case?
3 : I think we should
2 : Ok
2 : So move, move
4 : Ok
2 : I'm done.
4 : Oh wait, wait, wait
4 : Hm
4 : That's two moves, right?
2 : We don't need, we don't need that.
1 : Yeah, that's two moves, so you'd still have one
2 : We don't need that.
4 : We don't, but if we keep it in the pile it means
4 : it's less likely something else will get flooded. Do you see what I'm saying?
4 : Like if we keep this in this pile it means we won't pull something else,
4 : like Fool's Landing for example.
2 : So you, so you're saying I should use this, or I should shore up?
4 : No
4 : you could just shore it up and then one, two.
4 : Right, and then that'll be three of your actions.
2 : Oh
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna
2 : Wait what am I doing- I'm sorry, say that again.
4 : Shore up for one and then move two
2 : Ok
3 : Huh
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : (--)
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok cool
2 : Ok
2 : Alright so now I draw
3 : Yay
1 : Yup
2 : Perfect
4 : Alright
4 : that's what I'm talking about
2 : (--) we're gonna have to wait.
2 : Um
2 : Oh sorry, thank you
1 : No it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
2 : Ok
2 : Alright well
2 : ok
2 : Aw crap that's the one I'm standing on.
1 : (--) I see the Copper Gate in there.
1 : Or uh the other Gate
2 : No, Bronze Gate and Dunes of Deception.
4 : Ok
3 : Ok
4 : So
1 : Yeah that was a good move shoring that one up, that would've been sunk.
4 : Yeah
3 : So I can move right here
3 : and then flip this back over.
4 : Well look, here's what I'm thinking.
2 : Yeah
3 : Or
4 : Oh that's true, ok
3 : Or I can- And I can give
2 : Or
2 : or
4 : (--) we can't sandbag it either.
2 : You should
2 : Or I was gonna say, you can fly here
2 : and then flip this because we're all gonna have to end up on here
4 : Right
3 : Ok
2 : in order to leave.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : But look
3 : Oh right
4 : how
2 : And I- Since I'm here
2 : I
2 : I can get this on my next turn and we only have four minutes.
4 : Right
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
3 : Ok, so I'll do that and then
1 : Yeah
4 : So- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
3 : Can I give these two to him?
4 : That's what I was wondering about. I feel like she should fly here,
2 : Oh
4 : give those two to him,
4 : it'll be his turn,
4 : uh I don't know in a couple turns
1 : Mmhmm
4 : He can get that thing.
4 : We have
4 : three Helicopter cards.
4 : Even if this sinks
4 : we can still get you here pretty easy I think. Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : go
2 : Go
3 : Ok so
1 : ok great.
4 : Alright
1 : So
3 : Should I fly him to me? What do you, what do you mean by that?
4 : No you wanna fly to him cause he's on the
3 : Where is he at?
4 : the wind tile. He's right here- Oh wait
3 : That's me
4 : You're right, ok, you wanna fly him to you.
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : Ok, so I'll use one of my Helicopter Lifts to fly me
2 : So you
4 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Take you
4 : So we still have two- Right we wanna definitely wanna keep one at this point
3 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : Yeah, they both have one.
3 : I give them two.
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
1 : So that's two of your actions and you can do a third if you
3 : So that's two of my actions and then I can fly here.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok cool.
2 : Cool
1 : Perfect.
1 : Ok
4 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : Two treasures
3 : Oh right
4 : And then I guess
3 : Sandbag and chalice
4 : I would probably just shore uh your spot up.
2 : Hold on
2 : she has to
4 : Ok
2 : get these but yeah you could do that when you go.
3 : Cool
4 : Oh yeah I'm just saying in the future.
3 : Um
3 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ok
3 : uh
3 : Cliffs of Abandon and Silver Gate.
1 : Ok
1 : awesome.
4 : Ok
3 : I'm like surrounded by water.
4 : So yeah
3 : Well you are
1 : Yeah
4 : I think the plan, I think what I'm gonna do is one, two and then flip this over,
4 : that way we're all pretty close, even if-
4 : Oh, no, no, no
4 : even if
4 : like all this shit sinks right?
2 : You should do that
3 : Wait, can't you go diagonal?
4 : I can move diagonal yeah.
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : It doesn't- yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : So that way you got this, even if the- everything sinks around him, he can still Helicopter out over to here.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok, so one, two
4 : gonna shore this up
2 : Ok
4 : That's three.
3 : Ok
3 : cool.
1 : (--)
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh
1 : And just remember you can
2 : Alright, we gotta go really fast
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : Oh
1 : these are treasures.
4 : Turn's over.
4 : Oh ok
1 : Yeah these go in here and that goes here, ok.
2 : It's not
2 : No this, this is
4 : Misty Marsh
2 : Is this
4 : Cave of
2 : This is here.
4 : Embers.
4 : Oh ok, this is gone
1 : (--)
4 : Whispering Garden is flipped, but you can still get it so it's not
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Great
4 : And then this is flipped too.
2 : Ok so
4 : You can go.
2 : You go
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : So take your- give me your four
1 : So
2 : Or you're not there- Yeah you are there.
1 : No I have to, I have to flip this first.
4 : No, no, no he is there.
1 : So I'm shoring this one up
4 : No you don't
2 : You don't have
4 : You can, you can leave it flooded.
1 : I thought
1 : Yeah, ok, so then
2 : Yeah, you can leave it flooded.
4 : Yeah
1 : Which two should I shore up next to me
4 : Uh
1 : for an action?
2 : Here just give me this first
4 : I would say just run, just go to the Fool's Landing.
2 : cause we have one minute and thirty second.
1 : Yeah
1 : ok.
1 : So that
4 : Ok so we're three
1 : I get this
4 : Oh so we're good, we're done, we're with three, ok.

2 : Oh yeah I can oh yeah that's right.
1 : Yeah
2 : Adjacent (--)
2 : Hmm, there we go Cliffs of Abandon's been shored up
3 : Great.
2 : So draw two treasure cards
2 : Sandbag and then this
2 : Mmhmm, water rise goes up
3 : Yup that one stays you just have to do two flood cards
1 : No that's only if you get a Water's Rise card
2 : No that's fine
2 : Ok cool.
2 : Um I have Gold gate and Lost Lagoon
1 : This is one.
2 : So this one's pretty much gone.
2 : ANd then put this on top of here.

3 : I'm gonna
3 : See
3 : I'm just gonna
3 : Fly over here
3 : And then I'm gonna shore this up
2 : Good idea.
3 : I'm gonna come back here, take my two treasure cards.
3 : Helicopter Lift and Chalice
1 : And then you need two from here.
2 : You need two from here.
3 : Right
3 : Temple of the Moon and
3 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Of course
1 : That's right next to it
1 : It's a good thing you shored that up
2 : Here we go yeah
3 : Alright.
4 : Um.
2 : Explorer
4 : Should I shore up one of those?
2 : You cna move diagnonally.
4 : So that's one, shore this ok.
3 : yeah
3 : Then you can actually shore up both of those
2 : Shore yeah shore both of them
2 : Two Treasure Cards
4 : This
4 : And then
4 : And then
1 : And then two flood cards
2 : And then you have two floods cards
4 : So Whispering Gardens and Iron Gate
1 : There's one
2 : Flips over and flips over I'll take this and (--)
1 : Ok so what do we all have
2 : I have two
2 : (--) air
1 : Ok
2 : Dragon things
3 : Don't think I can
3 : Walk up to hers and give her this on my next turn
2 : I'm thinking that when I get here I can trade with her
1 : So we gotta trade before we get there right?
1 : Ok.
3 : (--) get the these
4 : She I can only have one more so
3 : Yeah cause you can only have five total
2 : Yeah cause you can only have five or else you'll have to discard the card
3 : Right
3 : So we'll hold on to those for now
2 : Yeah I'm gonna hold on to these
1 : Ok and then I can give you two
4 : Or
1 : Right, right ok, so I can't switch with anyone
2 : Yeah
1 : So
3 : Unless you wanted to come down to here.
1 : I can
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Come down to me and give me a green one and I'll start stocking up on green and give her purple
1 : Ok and she can give you the other green
3 : That work?
3 : That'll work yeah, that's a good idea.
1 : Yeah alright so I'm red, so I'll move once then move again
1 : And then is there anything else I should really do?
1 : Righ
1 : Ok.
1 : Two Treasure cards, probably should shore that up soon
2 : (--)
1 : Yeah
3 : No
2 : We got our Water's Rise card
3 : I could
1 : If I have this guy Water's Rise
2 : So it's going up one level so you need to draw three cards on top you have to shuffle them and put them on top
1 : (--) shuffle is first right?
2 : Draw three
1 : Ok.
2 : Which ones?
1 : Temple of the Moon,Lost Lagoon
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Cliffs of Abandon that one was ah
2 : I think that one
1 : Discarded wasn't it?
3 : No it's right here.
1 : No.
2 : Yeah it's right here.
1 : That's the Phantom one
2 : Yeah
3 : Mhmm
1 : Ok so
2 : And place that right here.
1 : here
2 : Your turn is in alright, there's nobody I can really trade with
1 : I gotta discard this guy. That goes here?
2 : Right now it goes over here
1 : (--) the treasure one there you go
2 : So there's nothing I can really
2 : Trade with so i'm going to move
1 : Or do you want to shore up anything.
2 : Yeah I'm going to shore up I can shore up two right?
1 : Yeah you can't do diagonal though only adjacent and what you're on
2 : Yah that's what I figured so
2 : I'm going to move
2 : Any recommendations
3 : I mean if you stayed there you could shore up that one, shore up that one use your sandbags and shore up that one.
2 : So stay here? and shore Cliffs of Abandon?
3 : If you
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok that's a good (--)
3 : Cause we don't really need to save the Lagoon or the gate.
2 : No no I can shore up this one.
3 : The
3 : eh no
1 : No you can't you could do this one right?
2 : (--)
2 : You shore up oh ok.
3 : You can shore up the one you're on.
2 : There we go and I'll just
3 : And then if you use your Sandbag's we can save that one since it's got a treasure on it
2 : Alright and that gets me down one card though right?
2 : There we go.
2 : No it's my turn to draw two.
2 : Oh sweet. Look at that.
2 : (--) (sand pick )so that, draw two cards from here

1 : You got you
1 : Ok
3 : So I think I'm gonna shore
3 : This one up first
3 : And then come up here and then give that to her.
3 : Sound like a plan?
1 : Yeah
2 : That sounds good
3 : Yup
3 : That's yours now.
1 : Just two actions.
3 : That's three, cause I shored it and I moved and I gave it to her.
1 : Ok cool.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ok.
1 : So do you have five?
3 : And that, yeah so I have to discard one of these.
1 : Right.
2 : Discard the fire one. (name$$$) you can trade me eventually for one of these
3 : Yeah
2 : Does he hear us?
1 : Well
2 : Cause I'm gonna use when go have mine I'm gonna move, use Sandbags and then I take that as my third action and then take that

3 : Hmm hmmf
2 : Ahha
1 : Ok um
1 : I guess I might as well shore up these two
1 : Just to be safe
1 : Um
1 : This isn't one of the
1 : So it doesn't really matter if we lose it
1 : um
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So you want to start making your way to like one of the cru-fire crystal ones or one of the Ocean's Chalice things?
2 : mm.
3 : Cause you have to be on it to be able to collect yeah
1 : Yeah I was wondering that
1 : Or should we all just stay here until you can fly all of us three to one of those, ok I'll move
3 : Yeah that's true I mean
1 : Um
1 : So I used one turn right? So
1 : Two

1 : And then
1 : Two of the flood cards
1 : Temple of the Moon and Iron gate
3 : Iron Gate is over here
2 : Hmmff
1 : I guess we could try to get you to one of the
3 : Yeah the Earth-yeah
2 : Yeah (--)
1 : That one or any other one that has that
3 : But you're closer to this one and that one needs to be shore up anyway
1 : Yeah

2 : Iron Gate and Breaker's Bridge so Iron Gate's gone.
3 : Iron Gate's
3 : So I'm gonna give this to you
1 : Ok so
3 : So
3 : First action
2 : Oh
1 : And then I guess get rid of that one
1 : Wait don't we have to be
3 : Hmm
1 : We have to be adjacent right? Or on the same tile?
3 : Do we?
2 : Oh yeah wow
1 : Yeah hah, just kidding ha
3 : Oh no! Aghhh
1 : I mean you could fly to me and then give it to me
3 : Yeah
3 : That's true
3 : So I'll do that
3 : I'll fly to you and then I'll give it to you
3 : Um
3 : That's two of my actions
3 : And then I guess I'll shore up Breaker's Bridge
3 : Ok
1 : mmhmm.
3 : Alright
3 : you can move these
3 : And I have five ok
3 : And I need one more cause we're on three

1 : I'm gonna
1 : Move one
1 : And then
1 : Capture the
1 : Treasure
3 : Yeah that's an action
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok cause I discard that
1 : So I got this one
3 : Horray
1 : Um
1 : 
1 : Ok I don't need
1 : (--) to do anything else so
1 : I guess that's it.
2 : hmm
1 : And
1 : Crimson Forest, Howling Garden and Cities of Abandon
2 : (--)
1 : (--)
2 : Ok.
2 : I guess I should win this now
2 : Aand

2 : (--)
2 : Um
3 : Do you wanna go for the
3 : the
3 : Earrth Stone or the Wind Statue thing, the Earth stone? Ok.
2 : The ah
2 : It's probably cause I have two of them
3 : Yeah
3 : Then do you want to shore up this one? And then move down so that I can give this to you?
2 : I I I I a am
3 : I can move up and give it to you. Yeah.
2 : Water's Rise, oh no.
2 : Oh no, I've got that.
3 : Hang on, before you draw your flood card, I'm gonna shore up whispering garden because both of these are
1 : mm
1 : Yeah good idea
2 : Yup
2 : hmm
2 : And it's
2 : three again
2 : Whispering Garden
3 : That was
2 : Crimson First and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : So Crimson Forest is gone

2 : No I have to describe something
3 : I'm gonna
1 : Yeah that's good but
3 : Mm, shore up Whispering Garden
3 : And
3 : 
3 : Hmm

3 : I need two of these
3 : Another Helicopter Lift
2 : Mm, Hmm. Hmma
3 : Is my (--) still
3 : Alright Breaker's Bridge
3 : With Howling Garden and Temples of the Moon
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : I'm just gonna move up to

2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Ok.
1 : Oh Awesome
1 : Ok Silver Gate
3 : Mmmh

2 : Again
2 : Um
2 : Wait
2 : Wait what happened way to early
2 : Bronze gate
2 : Dunes of Deception
2 : And
2 : Coral Palace
1 : I think the fastest way to end it now
1 : Well no
1 : If you shore up this just in case
1 : and then just end your turn and then I'll just move down here and collect this
3 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Alright
3 : Sounds good, alright.
3 : So
3 : So write this up
3 : And that's the end of my turn
1 : Oh wait, you know what actually
1 : If you, can you fly other people? Yeah if you can fly me
3 : Yeah I have three Helicopter Lifts
2 : Oh that's me
1 : You could oh yeah never mind, you could just walk there then, that doesn't matter
3 : (--)
3 : Um oh yeah so
3 : And, and I need I'm gonna discard
3 : Discard both of these in case (--)
3 : Um
3 : And the name of like
3 : So Misty Marsh
3 : Temple of the moon
3 : Temple of the Sun
3 : And
3 : Tidal Palace
1 : Ok so I'm gonna
1 : I have one
1 : (--) a second
1 : turn
1 : And
3 : So you take that
1 : And then I guess I should just move to Fool's landing for my next thing
3 : And then
3 : Yeah
1 : (--)
2 : Yeah
1 : Alright, I'll take
3 : um
1 : I don't know the Treasure Cards just in case there's something (--)
2 : Mmhmm.
2 : or something unhelpful
1 : Or that
3 : or yeah
1 : Um ok so not yet
3 : At least we're still on three.
1 : Yeah
1 : We're not gonna
1 : Ok.
1 : Hmm.
1 : mm.
1 : Whispering Garden
1 : Coral Palace
1 : And the Copper Gate
1 : Which I think is out yeah.
3 : Right? Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Then
1 : I guess over there?
3 : Ok so here.
2 : And then
3 : Ok your turn.
1 : So we could just
3 : We could just Helicopter Lift
1 : Yeah
1 : Everybody over there.
3 : Yeah
3 : I mean I guess I'll
3 : Move you here, that's one
3 : Move you here, that's two
3 : Helicopter Lift all of us off the island
1 : Whoooo!
2 : Whoo!
3 : We;re alive! We survived

1 : Ok.
1 : So
1 : I'll shore up these two
1 : And move here.
1 : And shore up these two.
1 : And can you pass me
1 : the treasure cards
1 : Thanks
1 : And Water's rise already.
3 : 
2 : I can shuffle these if you want
3 : Do you have to draw the
3 : flood cards first or
4 : No that's after
3 : Wait
2 : You have to, you have to do Water's Rise immediately
3 : Ok
3 : Oh water ok
1 : And Phantom rock and Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ah Phantom Rock's gone
3 : Oh
4 : No here
1 : Thanks
2 : Alright um
2 : We're going to
2 : Is this adjacent to me?
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok I'm going to
4 : Right? What's your na yeah
4 : You're red
2 : Cause I'm right here ok
1 : Ah I'm red
4 : Oh now it's not adjacent, I'm sorry you're gray, so it's not.
2 : No no I'm gray
2 : So not even ok, so now I'm going to
4 : But I could
2 : Um
2 : 
4 : But you can move and make it adjacent to you
2 : Yeah so that'll be one
2 : Action, this is two actions then
4 : Oh
2 : Give
2 : Um
2 : 
1 : 
1 : I could give
4 : Yeah give him that or give me that
2 : that
4 : The Lion thing
2 : This one yeah I'm trying to just like, whcih do you think
4 : That
4 : that doesn't matter either way
3 : maybe who ever's closer to it
2 : like closer to
1 : Probably I would give her, I would give her the lion because she's
2 : if it gets you closer to, yeah that makes sense
4 : I'm right there? Ok yeah that makes sense
2 : Alright yeah
2 : Um and then take two of these
2 : And then I have to draw two
2 : Ohh 
4 : Oh so that one's gone
2 : It's gone
2 : And
1 : The one I'm on is
1 : (follow them)
2 : Sorry
3 : 
3 : Ok
3 : Oh yeah (--)
3 : So
3 : 
3 : See I have a purple one
3 : So I guess I could move
1 : (--)
1 : You could fly to me and give it to me if you want.
3 : 
1 : Although actually
4 : Oh yeah that's a good idea.
3 : Give it to you
1 : O don't have any of the purple right now
4 : (--) you find them
4 : Oh no but that doesn't make sense
3 : Connect the purple
3 : 
4 : Yeah you don't fly to me and give it to me
4 : Cause I have the purple one
3 : You're green
2 : Should we maybe fly him off the flooded one?
3 : Yeah but you're not closer to the purple
4 : Yeah that makes sense
3 : Like the purple one is here
3 : And
3 : Next to him, I guess you could work on getting them
1 : Yeah we could meet on the space and trade
3 : Ah
3 : (--) the lion
4 : Ok
1 : I wouldn't take to many turns
4 : Ok
3 : Maybe I'll just move
3 : To the
3 : Try
2 : I'm just scared that this is gonna
1 : I'm gonna
2 : Alright I guess that doesn't matter because you'll be able to go anywhere but
3 : Oh
3 : I can
4 : Oh no, that's that's good though she should
4 : Definitely fix that one
3 : Oh so fly there then fix that one
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok so that's one
3 : Two
3 : And then
3 : 
3 : I don't
3 : thin kI'm going to do anything else
3 : And then I just stick with two moves
4 : Yeah you don't have to, you can stop
2 : Mm.
3 : Ok I'll just stick with two then
3 : And I'll draw two more
3 : Ok and then two flood cards
2 : Lost Lagoon and Breaking bridge
4 : That one
1 : 
3 : That's next, right next to it
2 : That's the other one
1 : oop
1 : There we go
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
4 : So I can move here and then fix that one.
2 : Oh cause you can look diagonally right?
4 : Yeah
4 : WEll that's one move
2 : Wait does
4 : What
1 : I don't know if there's
2 : it said adjacent
1 : take backs in this game
4 : Why?
1 : What no she can move diagonally that doesn't matter
2 : Oh does that mean that you're adjacent to this now?
4 : yeah
2 : Ok got it
1 : Well adjacent is just if you're directly on it. Let's use the explorer so her special thing is she can do
3 : Yeah
4 : So I can do it, anything diagonally
2 : She can kind of do anything got it
1 : (--)
4 : Ok so that's my first move
4 : And moving, fixing this will be my second move
2 : Mmhmm.
4 : Ok
4 : And then what else should I do?
4 : should I give
4 : this
1 : I would say
4 : Oh no we're not on the same tile
1 : I think it might let's see
1 : If you move here, you're pretty close to three separate treasures
4 : Mmhmm.
4 : Yeah that's a good idea
1 : So that's what I think
2 : Might as well yeah
3 : Hmm. Yeah.
4 : Ok so I'll do that.
1 : Cause then like you can make progress towards trying to get this, the statue
4 : Here
4 : Mmhmm.
4 : Yeah
1 : Or what
4 : And I can collect the statue by myself, oh yeah I would have to cause it
1 : Yeah you can
1 : But yeah
4 : I just have those two
4 : Ok.
4 : And there's the magic, three, four, five
4 : And then can I have
4 : Two that was
2 : Two oh sorry
4 : Oh ok, Whispering Gardens
2 : Two of them
4 : And Iron Gate
4 : Oh
1 : Hmm
1 : Ok so I'm gonna
1 : What I think I want to try to do is get the chalice.
1 : So four of them are already on there, so I can definitely do that.
1 : So
1 : who's
1 : blue?
3 : Ok
4 : mm
3 : I'm blue
1 : You're blue
1 : Alright let me
1 : sh
1 : I'll trade you
1 : Oh wait
1 : Let me look at this real quick
3 : (--) trade or
4 : Yeah I don't think you can trade, you can just give it to her.
1 : yeah that's right so
2 : mm.
1 : I'm not gonna bother doing that
1 : Ok so I'm gonna move
1 : here
1 : Shore that up
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Never mind.
1 : That's all for now.
1 : the water's rise
2 : oh
2 : we got luck
1 : So now we're at three
4 : Oh no
4 : We can't lose that guy
1 : Yeah
4 : That would stink
1 : Well we can but
1 : (--)
3 : Hmm
2 : And I guess because this is getting discarded
2 : You don't have to discard another one right? Cause you're passed five?
1 : two four well I
1 : have five
4 : No that doesn't count
1 : But you're right that's getting discarded anyway
2 : Ok
1 : But even so
2 : (--)
1 : Like even (--) I only have five so
2 : (--)
3 : MM oh
4 : I don't think ,I don't think your card counts as
1 : It does, yeah it does not
4 : Ok
4 : No
2 : That's gone
3 : Mhhf
4 : Ok I knew that was gonna happen
2 : 
1 : No, we should have, we should have used the Sandbag I didn't even think of it
2 : Oh
1 : tta
1 : hello
2 : We're learning ummm
2 : t t t
2 : I
4 : You should give me your lion right?
2 : But I can't cause you're five already and I don't want to get rid of
4 : Oh no
4 : Yeah that makes , yeah I get ya
2 : Um I could use a sandbag if we're
2 : thinking that we need
2 : one, do I have to
3 : 
3 : You can use that an any
2 : Do i have to be near it?
3 : Time
4 : Oh yeah can you use that at any time?
1 : No it's anywhere. It's any of the tiles
2 : Oh ok
1 : But neither of those are like important
2 : Um
4 : Yeah so don't use it yet
1 : I wouldn't, yeah I'd save it
2 : Oh true, true
3 : Yeah in there on the edge of the game to
4 : Wait until this guy
4 : goes away cause
4 : if we lose him then we lose
1 : Yeah
1 : Wow
2 : so do we want to do anything actually?
1 : yeah
3 : We I don't think we need, well cause we only need three out of the four treasures.
1 : Yeah we do don't lose automatically but it will make it way harder to win
4 : Oh yeah that's true too
3 : Yeah
1 : Well let's see so we have lion and
1 : (--)
2 : The one that just went away, what was the one that went on there?The lion? Ok
3 : It was the lion.
4 : As the lion
1 : Um I'd say move like
1 : Here, just so we're all, like we should probably try to be fairly spread out I think
2 : So move two, you think?
1 : Just (--) somewhere
2 : Move two cause I have a red alread so
1 : Yeah sure.
2 : Um and then I'll just
2 : take this
2 : 
2 : Oh yeah (--)
4 : Oh and there's the Lion
2 : nice
2 : Ok this is the count right? that's
4 : Ok well that's good
4 : Yeah
4 : Don't forget to take three, yeah
2 : 
3 : yeah I have three
2 : Oh we're
2 : Oh that's
1 : they're moved up to three
2 : Three I see
2 : Temple of the Moon ok that one, ok Cliffs of Abandon
4 : That's right next to it
2 : Oh there, oh no, there Iron Gate
1 : And Iron Gate
4 : So we lost him
3 : That's this one
1 : ok well it doesn't matter
2 : Ok
4 : Oh that's ok, wait can I have the card?
2 : Oh
2 : Mm, yeah
2 : sorry
4 : Thanks
4 : that's already
3 : Ok so I'm on
3 : Temple of the Moon
4 : So we should fix that
1 : mm
2 : Yeah
3 : (--)
4 : Definitely
3 : And then
4 : So that's one
1 : And so what I think would work
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah good idea is fly to me and give me the
1 : Um chalice
1 : because I'm trying to get that. And then that'll give me three out of the four
2 :  oh that'll get you one step closer
4 : Mmhmm.
3 :  ok
1 : And then the explorer can, yeah
4 : And I could just give it to you
2 : Awesome yeah that'll be the next turn
3 : Ok alright
1 : And then hop right back, if you want to stay on that tile
4 : Yeah
3 : Should I fix
3 : Cities of Abandon before I fl-
3 : Oh no wait
1 : You can't give me the tile if you do that
3 : Oh no I would have to fly and then give you the tile ok
3 : Gottcha
4 : So fly to you
1 : Thanks
4 : That's three ok
3 : Ok so the lion and then the
3 : The crystal
3 : Move Temple of the sun, just this one.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Crimson Forest
3 : And Breaker's Bridge
2 : I'm horrible at finding these
3 : there hard
4 : I know
4 : It's like upside down to
4 : Ok so
2 : wait
4 : I should come to you right?
1 : Mmhmm. and give me the
4 : and give you that
1 : other chalice whcih means I'm gonna have to
1 : discard one of these
2 : Oohhh
4 : Oh I didn't think about that
4 : But
1 : But then we'll definitely, but then I'll definitely get
4 : I didn't realize there were more
4 : yeah yeah
1 : the chalice next turn unless
1 : Yeah I will definitely do it so
4 : Ok so I'd have to do two moves so
3 : Maybe I could
1 : Oh you're
3 : Should I heli
4 : Oh that's not me
3 : Ah should I helicopter lift you ? Oh
1 : Yeah you're right there
4 : I'm right here
1 : No she's right there
3 : Oh never mind
4 : Whew i got nervous
4 : Ok one
4 : And then give you that
1 : Two so whcih one do you guys think?
4 : That's two
3 : I think you should discard the
3 : Crystal
1 : This? The red one?
2 : The purple
3 : Well actually I don't know
1 : Let's see here
2 : I have one
3 : That we have three of each on currently
1 : yeah
4 : yeah it doesn't
4 : totally mat, oh well we have four yeah
1 : I'll discard this because I'll
2 : No we have four
3 :  oh we do have four ok
2 : We have four so get rid of the red one yea
4 : four yeah get rid of that one
1 : yeah definitely
2 : op sorry
4 : ok so that was one move for me
1 : It's ok
4 : um
1 : One move and then you trade it so that's two actions
2 : Oh two so two
4 : Oh so two moves
3 : then you
4 : and then
1 : So you can go right back if you want or you can fix
2 : maybe just
4 : Yeah let's fix this guy
2 : fix 'em
4 : cause that would, if we lose that that would be a bridge between a bunch of them
1 : Mm.
2 : Mm.
4 : Ok
4 : can I have two?
4 : those cards
2 : mmhmm
4 : Ahhh
2 : No Water's Rise oh!

4 : Yeah that's like the second move
1 : This is the second action
2 : Oh got it ok yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : And

2 : But you can
3 : Yeah but
1 : You could with the Sandbags
2 : I will for sure

3 : Yeah
1 : So (--)
2 : So can I just
4 : Yeah so put that there
2 : from any point
1 : Yeah and it doesn't count as an action
2 : I don't have to be anywhere near it. So do this one we're saying?
1 : Yeah
1 : then do the other one
3 : Oh use both?
2 : Use both of them
1 : I mean if we lose those that's gonna make it
1 : pretty difficult
2 : sure
3 : t oh yeah
1 : is what I'm thinking
2 : so do this
1 : I mean if you guys think we should save it
3 : I don't know
1 : What do you think , it's your card
2 : (--)
4 : It's
2 : I , I think it's
4 : It's like a matter of luck
3 : How many do we have of those
2 : We only
1 : Well she had two and that's it
2 : mm, so should we save it for Fool's Landing?
3 : I mean like total in deck
1 : Oh I don't know
4 : Oh yeah that's actually wise
2 : because then you might be able to fly over and save it if you
4 : Yeah that's true
2 : So maybe save it
3 : Ok yeah
4 : Yeah so keep it
4 : Ok so you still have to do your third action
2 : So your
3 : MMm
4 : or you dont' have to
1 : or yeah
1 : I don't. Imight not. I can't really think of anything useful.
2 : ok
3 : MMm I don't know maybe move to the crystal? I don't know
1 : Cause I need to
2 : Just to put that
3 : Since there's no use for Coral Palace anymorea
1 : mmhmm, except as a bridge
3 : other than it beinga br- yeah
1 : That's too bad that I can't give this to you or trade it
3 : I feel like
2 : you could s- go to Cave of Shadows and then if Breaker's is still there grab it on the next turn
1 : Yeah
4 : That's true
2 : And then you'd be that one closer to the
4 : Ok
1 : Yeah that's true, it's unlikley but it will help
2 : Ok
2 : Um
4 : Ok so pick your two treasure cards
2 : oh yeah
1 : A lift or on another crystal
2 : Oh nice ok.
4 : Oh that's good.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Lost Lagoon
1 : gone
2 : taa
2 : Hmm it was already lost
1 : TEmple of the Sun, gone.
3 : And
3 : this happens when?
3 : Ah the wrong one
2 : oh
1 : Crimson Forest, oh gone well that one didn't matter
3 : Ah
4 : gone
3 : Ok
2 : Ok so lesson learned use the Sandbag's alright
4 : You should probably give me.
2 : yeah
2 : 
4 : Your lions
4 : right?
2 : do you want to get rid of what you already have though?
4 : because then
4 : well I can get rid of this guy
1 : yeah cause we already have the chalice
2 : oh true
4 : And then she and I are on the same thing and then she can give me hers.
2 : So I'll give you one Lion
4 : yeah
2 : Ok
4 : So I can get rid of the chalice.
2 : Um wait can I give multiple card as one action
1 : Even though one action is giving one card but you can you have three total actions
3 : Ah
2 : It says treasure cards
4 : You can yeah you can give it to anyone.
4 : Ok so you just used one action.
2 : Ok so that's not part of my special um.
4 : So where are you?
2 : 
2 : Maybe I move closer to well or I'm already on the red and I'm not gonna get the Lions
2 : Um I don't think I'm really going to do anything else at this point that's useful
4 : Yeah you might just want to stop.
2 : yeah
4 : Also
4 : You don't want to run out of time.
2 : Yeah
2 : (--) these oh great I have two more reds.
4 : Oh good
2 : Awesome
3 : Ok
3 : mm
2 : mm
2 : Let's see Tidal Palace
2 : Silver Gate
2 : Mmhmm and Copper Gate
4 : This one
2 : Ok
3 :  ok
3 : So we need to give you a Lion. Are you text to a lion?
3 : You can get
4 : We're around the same thing right? Cause you're blue?
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah so you should give me
3 : But you could get to the Lion on the next turn
4 : mmhmm
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok she gave me that.
3 : Oh well we have to discard something
2 : But then you have to
4 : BUt that's ok cause he's got two.
4 : And you've got one and I've got one.
1 : Yeah well that'll work out.
2 : True
3 : Ok sos we have three. Ok so I'll give you that.
3 : Or one.
3 : Move.
3 : And then
2 : And the save on the (--)
4 : Yeah I was gonna say fix that one.
3 : Should I give you something?
3 : If you have three
1 : Um
3 : Should I give you one of the purple?
2 : Cause he's kind of near there if we save this and go (--)
4 : I would, I would fix this
4 : Because then, because he can't even get to it unless you save it
2 : Yeah actually cause that's the bridge cause then he won't be able
1 : Yeah I'd say fix that.
3 : Ah ok.
2 : That's your second action?
4 : Ok
3 : Ok Mmhmm.
4 : Yeah so that's your second action
1 : And that's two
1 : And now
3 : Cause if I draw two cards I have to discard one of them
1 : (--) just move.
1 : Ah you're right.
3 : Cause I'd have six.
3 : So then I should give you this.
4 : Yeah actually that's a good idea
1 : You can't thought. You're already passed that point.
4 : Oh no but you can't (--) you're on the same
3 : Oh I'm not
3 : I can't forget these
3 : Ok you're green
3 : Oh well so you dont' really need that ok so
3 : Oh
1 : Yeah I forgot you had those two (--)
3 : Yeah should I just
3 : Well should I use the Heli
4 : What do the Helicopter Lifts do?
1 : You can move anyone anywhere.
3 : Yeah I can move it into anything.
2 : Do we want to move him closer to our purple?
2 : The Engineer or closer to (--) people
3 : (--) do move you on to purple?
1 : Um yeah that's actually pretty decent.
4 : Actually that's not a bad idea
4 : That's actually a good idea. That's what I would do
3 : Move you to purple? I could do that at any time.
3 : But
3 : But if you want to do that now
2 : Oh mayber
2 : save it
4 : Yeah do it now before you
4 : draw your cards
3 : Ok
4 : And then you can keep those cards
3 : Or should I draw the cards before and then see what
3 : the cards (--)
4 : Ah that's true
1 : Yeah actually do that because when you discard an action card like you have to use it at the same time
2 : Oh that's true. Ok do that, yeah, yeah.
3 : And then
4 : Actually yeah that's true do that
3 : Can I do that?
3 : Wait when you discard you have to use it?
1 : Like if you discard the Helicopter LIft, you don't just like throw it away, you use it and throw it away
3 : Oh
1 : So yeah definitely, draw two
3 : Ok
3 : So then
1 : (--) where one is
3 : So yeah two
2 : And you got a Lion ok
3 : Thanks
2 : (--)
4 : So now you're at s
3 : We dont' need this purple because
3 : We already have enough
3 : And
3 : Are
3 : Yeah we have enough
4 : We don't need the lion
3 : Oh we do have a lot of Lion ok
1 : And she already has four lions so get rid of that.
3 : Ah ok so then let's get rid of the lion
2 : And I have one lion so I can give that to (--)
4 : yeah
4 : So get rid of that
1 : Yeah there you go and you can save your helicopter lift
3 : Ok
1 : (--)
3 : So Bronze Gate
2 : mm
3 : Oh there's a lot of Gates. Ok Cave of Shadows
3 : Dunes of Deception
2 : Oh ok.
3 : That's ok I can we can fly ourselves off of it I can fly myself
4 : Ok my turn
4 : So I should probably fix that one.
2 : 
1 : Um
4 : And then go to that one.
3 : No cause you cause you have to use
3 : You need three moves
3 : get
3 : you have
4 : Oh you're right,you're right ok.
3 : You have to travel tweice to get there and then discard
1 : Yeah get the treasure cause I'll get these on my turn so
4 : So I'll go
4 : Ok
4 : So I'll go here
4 : And then this is two
4 : And then I get this guy
4 : And
1 : That's actually only two actions so
3 : No that was three cause she had to
3 : Um ove
1 : She can go diagonal
3 : two
3 : Oh you went diagonally
4 : Yeah
3 : Oh I didnt' know you went diagonally
3 : I forgot you could do that
4 : And then
4 : Oh I wish I could give this to you
2 : So didn't we save you?
3 : Yeah so then you can save that tile again.
2 : We could save that?
4 : Oh yeah then I could do that, that's a good idea
2 : Cause you can save diagonally that's all?
1 : Might as well yeah.
3 : Yeah
4 : Cause I can save diagonally
4 : Ok cool and can I have two of those?
3 : Oh man
2 : I keep forgetting you can do that. It's so cool.
3 : I know I forget she can go diagonally.a
2 : Jealous of your talents.
4 : And then ok
2 : Alright
3 : Oh man
4 : I know I'm worried.
4 : Cave of Embers
3 : That doesn't sound familiar so that's good.
2 : Yeah
4 : Howling Garden
2 : good
4 : And Misty Marsh a
1 : Ok so we already have the lion, so I don't care if that sinks
2 : Ok so I'll
3 : tt
3 : It's not bad
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah
1 : We already have the chalice so I don't care if that sinks or that although that would suck cause that's a bridge.
2 : Mmhm
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah so let's try to save that one
3 :  yeah
3 : So you need the one that she's on?
3 : The one that Messenger
1 : 
3 : The one that the Messenger's on and then
3 : The
3 : The one that you're on
1 : Um
2 : I just realized we should have given
2 : (--)
4 : But I couldn;t cause we weren't on the same thing
2 : Yeah that's true. I keep, I keep remembering that that's my talent and then I'm like never mind
4 : I know it's so confusiong
1 : Ok so I need to get here.
4 : You're the red one. You should save this one and then go up, up.
2 : 
1 : Yeah
3 : (--)
1 : That's what I was thinking
1 : Yeah cause it doesn't matter if we lose that.
4 : Yeah
3 : Do you want ok, yeah I mean you could do that but I could fly you there if you, ok you have a helicopter-ok so we have three Helicopter lifts
4 : Definitely
1 : Save that up
4 : Save that one
1 : Mhmm.
2 : That's one, two, three
1 : two, three I don't have a Heli- Oh I do, never mind
3 : Yeah
1 : Well that's good cause we need at least one of them to get off so
3 : Yeah ok
3 : We all have to make it to Fool's Landing right?
1 : So I have these two
1 : No, you won't have any, that's unfortunate.
2 : Yeah
4 : You should use your Helicopter Lift to go to him and then give him those.
1 : With your remaining actions, yeah that's a good idea.
4 : Yeah
3 : You ok
1 : Cause then I can have
1 : I can Helicopter Lift both of us back here.
4 : And then on your turn.
1 : And then everybody else just has to
1 : make it
3 : Ok and then should we just wait for her to collect the cave of
4 : yeah
1 : No cause I'll we'll have three. You need three of the four
3 : Embers
4 : No cause we only need three
3 : Oh right, right right. Ok so.
4 : Ok.
1 : Yeah that sounds like a good plan. Oh thanks.
3 : Ok should I should I go there now?
4 : So then go?
2 : You're welcome.
1 : Oh, now we already have three
4 : And then your flood cards.
2 : Oh I keep
2 : that that card doesn't get
1 : (--) Coral palace
1 : Observatory, Watchtower
4 : Good
2 : (--)
3 : (--)
3 : The Water Rise's Card
4 : Ok cool
2 : I'm gonna save this one. Um should we move this way or this way? We already have the cup
3 : Oh man
4 : Yeah good call
1 : Try to get to Fool's Landing cause if this goes the way we're planning, like I get this is in the next turn
4 : Mmhmm.
3 : mm.
1 : And we all need to be on here to win.
2 : 
2 : We already have the lion so I don't care about
3 : And
2 : Giving that away so I'm just going to move in a straight path then
1 : Yeah sure
4 : No but you can't do two at the same time, so this is your first action
2 : Oh I can't
2 : And then moving is my second and then
4 : So then
4 : move, move second
4 : third right?
1 : yeah
1 : Right, your're right
2 : So I shouldn't save this one you think?
1 : No there's no point
4 : No cause we don't, we don't need it
2 : Oh
3 : Oh yeah and if none of us are in the area than it's ok if it needs
2 : And all of us have a path to here. Ok good. Got it.
4 : Yeah, yeah yeah.
2 : Oh awesome, so I got my own red
1 : Yeah
2 : Um yeah.
4 : Just in case yeah
1 : And
1 : So I think we have to shuffle now
1 : And continue drawing because this ran out
1 : Oh
4 : You only have five cards in your hand
1 : That to
4 : Oh so you have to get rid of one of those. Get rid of the chalice
2 : Oh oh, oh yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh you do have ok.
2 : If I didn't even count the Sandbag
1 : So
2 : So we shuffle all of them?
1 : 
1 : I don't remember what it said. I think so though
3 : Water Rise's cards
2 : (--)
3 : Um
2 : Um
3 : If
3 : you draw a
1 : Immediately shuffle and stack the cards to draw yup
2 : So shuffle all of them you think?
4 : Ok yes
4 : No, no no just those ones
1 : Just these, just just these
2 : So save, these are the two that I already have
4 : so save the ones that are in your hands
4 : yeah
2 : I'll just do these while you do that
1 : Ok sure
3 : Oo yeah Flood card
2 : So Fool's Landing is a priority to save I think
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah cause we lose if it sinks
4 : You should use your Sandbag now to save it.
1 : We'll know cause there's only one of each, so it's not gonna sink
4 : Oh ok
4 : And the observatory
1 : Observatory which is
2 : Observatory
2 : is
2 : Gone so I move to here.
1 : Well perfect. That's where you're goin' anyway.
4 : yeah good idea.
3 : Oh Fools' Landing's flooded.
2 : Opp
1 : 
3 : Ok but it just got flooded.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok so I'm
3 : We'll see what
3 : What was I gonna do?
1 : Oh actually if yeah if she goes yeah you're right, oh yeah I keep forgetting
4 : But careful, if she draws Water's Rise they do that, so I would use a Sandbag to save that right now.
1 : Definitely
2 : Right now or
4 : Oh that goes there and then that's saved
2 : (--)
4 : Ok cool. Phew
1 : Right good point.
2 : Nice
1 : That's definitely what's gonna happen
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok so then you were gonna use your Helicopter thing
1 : to fly to here
4 : to fly to here to give him that
3 : right
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : So that's one action right?
1 : MMhmm.
3 : Well this doesn't count as my action though. Cause it's a special action card.
1 : They don't?
4 : Up
1 : Oh you're right it doesn't count as an action
4 : Ok so yeah do that
3 : Yeah
3 : Maybe just, well I could always fly myself to the Fool's landing if it doesn't sink.
1 : Yeah that's true
3 : Uh oh
4 : Yeah so use that
4 : And then who are you?
3 : To just meet you all there
3 : So I'm blue
1 : You're
1 : You're blue right?
2 : I'm peach she's blue
3 : yeah I'm blue so I'm
1 : So
3 : Ok
4 : So that's your move, and then this is the first action
3 : Ok this is my first action
1 : So that's one
1 : First action
4 : Get rid of your lion
3 : yeah
1 : Lion
3 : Um
3 : But then you're gonna fly both of us back but I need I can
4 : First action
1 : I can do that because then you still have a
1 : Helicopter Lift if you need it
3 : Yeah but I mean I have another action so if I
1 : Right but the lift
3 : If I don't need to be on this
1 : The lift can also move other people like that aren't even like so you could move her elsewhere.
3 : Ok so then maybe
4 : I would just end if I were you
1 : Well I'll shore up
2 : yeah
3 : Well
4 : I don't think you need to do anything else. yeah.
1 : like
1 : Actually yeah it doesn't matter cause we don't these
2 : I can get these in the next one then
4 : Oh we don't need to.
2 : True or he can ok
4 : So
1 : We could get all four and get like bonus points or something.
3 : I mean was it, I can I don't know
3 : I'll just, I'll just hang out.
4 : We have 8 minutes left
1 : If you want you can shore up or you can just end
1 : (--) I don't see much of a point in shoring up
3 : Ok I'll just draw two
1 : If it'll make you feel better you can
3 : I want another Helicopter Lift
3 : but also Water's Rise
4 : ok
3 : Yeah that Fool's Landing will be flooded.
1 : Yeah (--) like 100 percent
3 : Cause it would have been on top
3 : Oh ok so
1 : So we're still at three
3 : Ok.
2 : Twilight ok Foold's landing is back under, Watchtower
3 : Oh so
4 : Ok
4 : Fool's Landing
3 : Twilight
1 : Is out
3 : Is that Temple of the Moon?
4 : Watchtower's gone.
3 : Oh no.
1 : and
2 : and

2 : Oh sorry. Yeah.
4 : Ok now its my turn
4 : So
1 : just
1 : go to Fool's landing
4 : yeah
4 : so
4 : one
1 : one
4 : two
4 : BUt I have to shore it up
4 : i have to save it
1 : So go diagonal so go one
2 : So why don't you go yeah go
4 : Oh yeah
4 : Sorry can I go backwards

1 : Ok
2 : So you have to choose three actions
1 : Right (--) right um
1 : Tidal
2 : So remember all these cards are in here already
1 : Wait so I can move right?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : I will move
1 : And I can
2 : Wait
2 : That's too many
1 : I can shore up to two cards
3 : Ok
2 : Oh I see in one turn.
1 : Yeah and then I moved
2 : Ok
1 : Um so two can you pass me two cards?
2 : Sure
3 : sh
1 : (--)
3 : Don't I want to shore up
3 : the one with the Treasure because if that sinks we won't be able to get it.
1 : Can I go back and do that?
3 : Ah I don't know.
2 : I can do it next turn. I don't think that you're allowed to go back and
1 : Oh ok.
3 : Oh yeah I guess it matters
2 : We do?
1 : Ok.
1 : Oh no.
2 : Oh no.
2 : And don't forget to draw your
1 : Ok, that would go back in the treasure
2 : Flood yeah
1 : (--)
1 : Um
2 : So you have to draw three of those
1 : Two
2 : Oh yeah equal to the water level
3 : OH we have to shuffle first.
1 : Right
2 : Crap
1 : This or that
3 : Now those yeah, that's of the six yeah
1 : Ah ok
1 : And just put it here?
2 : Alright
1 : There's two
2 : What are we lookin' at?
2 : Alright this is sunken and that's sunken as well.
1 : perfect
2 : No it's sunken you gotta
3 : Oh right. Yeah put you over here.
2 : Take it off and put it in there.
1 : Alright so is it your turn?
2 : Three
2 : Yes.
2 : So I'm gonna
2 : Move
2 : Here
1 : Oh discard them
3 : Yeah since they're gone so
1 : Ok
3 : Can you only shore up um things you're adjacent to or just like anything? No (--) ok.
2 : Yes
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : I'm not sure
2 : So can I
1 : Up, down, left right it doesn't say any exceptions to that so I'm assuming not
3 : Ok
2 : Shore up this one.
1 : You can shore up that one.
2 : wait
2 : We're all in agreeance
3 : Yeah
1 : yeah
2 : I just want to be sure cause you knwo we can't go back and do things
3 : Right so that's like two right?
2 : And then
2 : That's two actions.
3 : You two should always be next to each other because then you can
3 : Send cards to each other and then
2 : I can send cards no matter what
3 : Or she can send cards to you and then you can send cards to me and I can go anywhere on the map
2 : I'm thinking I should move down here so that
2 : I can only shore up this next turn
1 : I mean it's in the far side does it even matter?
3 : No that's not necessary
2 : Unless you can you can land
3 : No these one's sorry. They dont't matter if they're shored up or not
1 : necessary
2 : Ok well a
1 : Yeah, as long as they're like within
2 : then
2 : People usually just move with her
1 : Fool's Landing
3 : As long as you're next to her it doesn't matter
2 : So where should we move?
1 : And that should be fine, btu I mean now it doesn't really matter to me.
1 : just
3 : Yeah I'm just sure that's fine
1 : I dont' think
2 : Ok cause I have to take three actions so W
3 : No you don't have to
2 : Oh
3 : Yeah you can take zero so
1 : Yeah up to three actions
3 : yeah
2 : So these are my two
2 : cards
2 : And
1 : Just two?
2 : throw in two of these
2 : We are sinking the Lost Lagoon, so that's gone
3 : That was that one.
1 : Lost Lagoon.
1 : Oh right.
2 : (--)
2 : Ok sink that as well as this
2 : And
2 : Breaker's Bridge is.
2 : Ahh
2 : Sunken
2 : So it's your go
3 : Alright
3 : Um
3 : So
3 : So
3 : Hmm
3 : I'm trying to think if
2 : I mean you might as well just fly over here and just shore it up. There's not really much
3 : No we don't have to shore that one up
3 : We don't have to shore up unecessary ones, but I was just thinkin'
3 : if I could either like move you guys
3 : with this thing
3 : or
1 : The two to Fool's Landing
3 : No in to um
2 : I mean it dones't matter now because we don't have a whole bunch of
3 : on the same tile
1 : the treasures yeah
2 : cards
3 : Oh yeah so
1 : So you're going to get the treasure
2 : so we might as well try to keep as many
2 : things on the board
2 : guess we can't so we can still move around
1 : That's true
3 : yeah
1 : So that's why you want
3 : Well this doesn't help you move anywhere
1 : I mean
3 : But
1 : yeah
3 : yeah um

1 : You dont' have to take an action if you don't
3 : Oh yeah after

3 : Um no
3 : Yeah and it's just one so
1 : The Water Rise cards though I mean
2 : I don't think so
1 : Really?
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : So it's just like that
2 : So it's
3 : Yeah and then I got this. I'll give it to you evetually anyways
2 : Yeah
1 : Alright
3 : Ok well I guess I'm done
2 : No you have to draw
2 : Three

1 : It's flooded?
3 : And then
3 : So it's
3 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : where is it?
2 : Oh we just discarded it

2 : But you drew three cards
3 : Whispering garden yeah
2 : So what was the third one?
3 : Was
3 : Wait what'd I do with it?
3 : Cities of Abandon
3 : Maybe I think I mean have accidentally discarded that
2 : So we're on a sunken tile now?
1 : Can you move to there or can we stay there?
2 : You don't move until it um
3 : Yeah so whoops so this goes over there.
2 : 
2 : floods
3 : These are discarded
1 : So if it's flooding then you don't you can still stay there.
2 : If it's sunken then yeah you can stay there.
3 : yeah
1 : eh, ok.
2 : I mean you can also unflood it.
1 : Sure, now I can yeah.
2 : Um
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah ok.
1 : So let me do that. There's one.
1 : This one is one.
1 : And
1 : move shore
1 : Just move here for two.
1 : So that's three actions right?
3 : I think so yeah.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Can you give me two cards?
3 : Oh wow
2 : And you draw
2 : Three of these.
1 : So now I
2 : You have how many card?
1 : No more than
1 : You can only have five ok.
2 : Ok
2 : Ok.
1 : Um and three.
1 : Ah Temple of the Moon
1 : Oh don't we have to shuffle that?
2 : No not unless you get a Water Rise card.
1 : Ok.
1 : Um.
1 : Howling Garden
1 : Ok that one.
3 : Oh (--)
1 : And Iron Gate
3 : Ah right here. ok.
1 : Ok.
3 : So
2 : Um
2 : So it's my turn now.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : So we need to get
3 : this card
2 : yeah
3 : to her
3 : and this one to you
3 : And then the yellow one to me or you? Yeah.
1 : Yeah yeah
1 : Do you probably?
3 : Ok so.
1 : And
1 : I can't give it until I have like until it's my
2 : Right.
1 : Next turn right?
1 : Ok.
3 : Yeah
3 : So, oh yeah so you're there.
3 : So if you moved here that's one.
3 : Oh wait you'd have to give it yeah
1 : You also don't have to take a turn
1 : You can take up to three turns if you just want to stay where you are.
3 : yeah
3 : Yeah fly
1 : So I would ju st
2 : I can give you these two.
3 : Is that one turn or two?
2 : Hmm but
1 : The ah I would be more than five but you can give it him definitely.
1 : Well why would he need that.
2 : Oh I see
2 : I see I can just wait for you to turn and give that to me
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Um so
2 : Pretty much.
1 : Ha
1 : I mean are you at
1 : Cause that's yours right?
1 : That thing was
2 : So I get three turns?
2 : Right?
3 : Um
1 : One, two, three yeah, so you can move to that place
2 : So
2 : I think that I will move here and then shore that up
2 : Move back to where I was
2 : Is that ok
1 : Or you can
2 : Hmm
3 : I think you should move here and shore that up, in case we need to exchange stuff.
2 : Oh I see I didn't realize.
2 : So
1 : Does it have to be short?
1 : Oh
1 : Is it already up?
2 : Is that's not, that's not
1 : That's not flooded.
2 : So
2 : Flooded yeah
3 : Oh yeah that's just blue yeah ok.
1 : Yeah, no you can move to Temple um of the Sun because that's where
2 : yeah
1 : This treasure is
1 : So just stay there.
2 : Or you can move to Temple of the Moon and shore it up at the same time.
1 : Well d yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok so
3 : Yeah
3 : Or you don't even have to move there you can just
2 : One two
1 : Stay
1 : Oh that would be nice to jus tbe at the treasure place
3 : Alright me to, yeah yeah.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Ah I'm having some struggles guys sorry.
3 : Nnnmm.
1 : Ok.
2 : Alright.
2 : So I draw these two.
1 : Two of ya
2 : Another Sandbags.
2 : Another
1 : Ok.
2 : Trelice and.
2 : Draw three of these Waters are three.
3 :  Ah, Ah
1 : We need four.
1 : Three
2 : Yeah.
1 : We need
2 : So let us sink Cave of Embers
1 : Four of these cards.
2 : Right here.
3 : Ok.
2 : Copper Gate.
1 : Silver Gate
2 : And Crimson Forest.
2 : Alright
3 : Ok.
3 : How, how many cards do you have?
2 : One, two, three four five
2 : crap
1 : Oh one, two, three , four, five six
2 : Um
2 : Because I'm Messenger, I can give one of my cards away though right?
3 : No now maybe, I don't know.
1 : Oh as ah
2 : Like if I draw
2 : Two, can I just give one of those away?
1 : What's your thingy say?
3 : Yeah.
2 : Oh I see. Per action.
2 : Mm.
1 : All of a sudden.
3 : And we can't like undo anything right?
1 : No.
2 : Right, no so.
1 : So just (--) it off.
2 : I
2 : I can't it's an action. Yeah.
3 : Just discard a Sandbag right?
1 : I thought you could
1 : Oh right.
3 : No.
1 : Wouldn't that be helpful?
2 : Oh
3 : I think.
3 : Since we already have a Sandbag, it would be more helpful
3 : Right, since we need we need these.
1 : Ah
3 : And we already have three so.
1 : True
1 : So I (--) yeah
2 : So what do you guys want to do?
3 : I would say discard the Sandbag
1 : Just
2 : Perfect.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : Hmm.
3 : Ok so yeah that's fine. Alright.
3 : Um.
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : You should probably
2 : Unsink the two things that have like
3 : Yeah
2 : Things on them
3 : Um so let me think
1 : You should yes, you should unsink your own thing.
2 : So you're on one. So you can unsink that one.
3 : Yeah
2 : Use an action to fly to the other one and then sink that one. That's three.
3 : Yeah but most (--) about
3 : What we can unsink as well as
3 : Using our turns to like get out the cards to the right people.
3 : Like I should be giving over this and she should be giving me this gold thing.
1 : Oh.
3 : Right, so.
1 : I well you can't give anything to me right now.
1 : Because I would go over five cards.
2 : Cause she has five.
3 : Yeah
3 : But I could bring.
3 : Both of you here.
1 : Two?
3 : Two this place after I unflood it.
1 : Um
1 : But i mean work close.
1 : Great.
1 : No not really to get our
2 : You can't bring both of us cause we're not on the same tile.
3 : two.
3 : Yeah
3 : Um
1 : They have to be on the same tile, I think.
2 : Wait we have to be on the same tile if you want to move two people.
3 : Do you? Move one or more pawns on, oh yeah ah well
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah so yeah
1 : I would say just stay at your
1 : Treasure place.
1 : And then sink whatever you can unsink.
3 : yeah
2 : I mean eventually we're gonna get a Water's Rise card. And then we'll shuffle these and there's a chance we that we'll lose those.
3 : Oh yeah well definitely ok well that's one, two.
2 : Two Treasure things.
3 : and then um, if I moved you here.
3 : And
2 : I'm here because I have
3 : Oh no.
1 : I can oh no it's me.
2 : Wait these.
3 : yeah I know but
3 : We still
3 : I mean everyone would have the right cards cause it won't matter where we are. So first we would need to have the cards before being wherever right?
2 : Right.
3 : Oh so that's one turn. Oh I forgot this was (--) too.
3 : Ah
1 : We have twenty minutes. I think we'll be fine.
3 : Yeah
1 : Well then these did you just take one action?
3 : So
3 : Yeah so I think I should
3 : Move
3 : you so then you could give me
3 : Um, the Lions and then I could give you this and you could move back
1 : Lions head.
2 : But yout can't give her anything because she a
1 : Are you gonna give that? You can't give that to me yet.
3 : Or yeah, I would just give her that. Yeah.
1 : We'd have to wait until my turn.
2 : It has five cards.
1 : Yeah
2 : She has five cards, so she'd have to discard something.
3 : Oh yeah.
1 : That would be one of my actions.
3 : Right.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah but that would be more (--) anyways.
2 : You could just unwink the one that's
3 : This?
2 : The one that has a thing on it.
3 : Oh right.
1 : The treasure.
3 : Ok I guess well do that.
1 : Yeah.
3 : That's three.
1 : Ok.
1 : There you go.
2 : So that's one action.
3 : Um, you can't
3 : Don't you have to be next to me?
2 : Oh you have to draw these two.
1 : should two, oh you haven't even done that ok.
3 : Oh yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : You need three flood cards right?
3 :  yeah
2 : One, two
2 : Three
3 : Coral Palace
3 : Oh here.
1 : Coral Palace.
3 : Yeah so that's over there. Oh.
3 : Dunes of Deception.
3 : And then Silver Gate.
2 : Yeah it's right there yeah.
3 : Yeah it's that one ok.
1 : Ok.
1 : So I have two of these. So if I give them to you, one, two, three, four, five cards.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Oh I can't give it to you know.
2 : Hmm.
1 : Yes cause I could have given it to you and you could have had the treasure (--)
2 : Why don't you give me your
2 : The one.
1 : Yeah.
2 : And unsink this blue one. That's your three actions. Are you ok with that?
3 : Wait don't you have to be next to each other to give cards?
2 : Oh I forget. I have to be.
1 : Really?
2 : In here right?
3 : Yeah.
2 : I can give cards to anybody but you can't.
3 : Yeah so let's oh yeah you oh yeah you
1 : Oh it has been (--)
2 : Yeah you have to be on the same tile
1 : Ah gosh.
3 : Ok so.
2 : Um
1 : I definitely
1 : I have to discard
2 : Right.
1 : Somethin'
2 : Before you draw. Do you want to draw first then discard?
3 : Ok
2 : Two
1 : Oh I can draw first
2 : I don't know
2 : There's nothing in the rules that says don't draw first
2 : Kinch
1 : If you ever have six or more you must immediately choose and discard the extra card to the Treasure.
3 : Yeah so the
2 : Yeah
1 : So then we draw one.
2 : Why don't you draw (--) it says six or more.
1 : Ok ok never mind.
2 : And then just discard which ever one.
2 : Ok well you have to
2 : Like that?
1 : Still three of those um.
2 : So this gets
1 : And so this obviously gets
1 : To go over there.
3 : Oh we have to shuffle too.
2 : What you want to discard
1 : Um so
3 : And then so wait what are the treasures? What did you get?
1 : I got two lion things.
3 : Ok so we have three lions, four fire and then
1 : Yeah.
3 : Do you have one of these things? And then four of those. So that's what we're
1 : Yeah I do so four
2 : I have the other two.
3 : We're going to four
1 : We'd have to get on the same tiles guys.
3 : Oh wait. yeah.
1 : Um.
2 : So
3 : So wait four of these, four of this and then three lions and three
1 : Three lions definitely
3 : Cups goblets whatever
1 : Yeah
3 : And then we'll just pick out of those two. (--)
2 : So which one is the one that we have four of all together? This one?
1 : So since we don't
1 : Um
2 : Is this the only one? This one and that one.
3 : Yeah that one and this one.
1 : Yeah this one, this one.
3 : So we have to pick.
1 : And this one?
2 : So
1 : No we don't have this one. I can
2 : No
2 : So discard either that one or the lion one.
3 : That's three. So which one's.
1 : One, two, three.
3 : Better for us
1 : Can I discard more than?
1 : Two I wouldn't want to do that actually
2 : Good.
1 : If I discard it will it go back in the pile?
2 : No I think it goes in the discarded.
2 : Treasure card.
1 : Ok
1 : So it's not as easy as just like giving you card um
1 : So I'll just discard This (--) I guess.
2 : Ok.
2 : And then you have to draw three of these.
2 : Oh wait let me put the thing back on first.
1 : Wait, did I make a move?
3 : Yeah.
3 : I'm not where were you? Oh there.
1 : I didn't make, yeah I didn't move.
3 : No you didn't do any moves.
2 : You
1 : Oh ord
1 : Oh we had to do an order.
3 : In order so you've already done
1 : Oh really?
3 : Yeah I think so.
1 : Ok.
1 : Bit I didn't want to move anyways or I could have.
1 : Could have (unsent) those things.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Ahhh
1 : ok
2 : We have to draw.
2 : Ooo
1 : I did that.
2 : You drew three of these?
1 : Yeah.
2 : Already?
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh ok (--)
3 : (--)
1 : Wait didn't I?
2 : I don't think so
2 : Can I use this at any time? Does this it has to be during my turn?
3 : It has to be your turn and it has to be before you draw those.
1 : (alright)
2 : I see
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh before she does ok this is gone
3 : Ok
1 : Um Whispering Garden
1 : Is gone.
1 : or flooded.
1 : Copper Gate
1 : Is gone
3 : Ok
1 : What I forget?
2 : Ok.
3 : Ok so
3 : What can we
2 : So it's my turn so I'm not
1 : Wait, wait ,wait draw flood card equal to the water level
3 : You're over there
2 : Yeah I don't have fancy cars like I can't move people.
3 : Well you should definintely use thta Sandbag
2 : Right.
2 : So I'm thinking I should move one, two right?
3 : For this and this
2 : Well my third action should be to unshore this and then I use my Sandbag as an action to unshore this?
3 : That can unshore two of the Sandbag. Oh it's just one?
1 : No it's one.
2 : It's just one.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah a
3 : Can, can you also
3 : unshore, oh no that's you, that's your think right
2 : So
2 : I mean we have like fifteen minutes.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Ok.
1 : No
3 : So you should not unshore this
3 : And you should just use that to
3 : Cause we're not going after these. These are all gonna be discards anyway.
2 : What?
3 : So
1 : Should you move to the same tile as me or can we should try to be on the same tile cause if we're gonna exchange these anyway or we're trying to?
3 : You two yeah you guys should try to get
1 : It
1 : It would be covenient to stay on the same tile.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok well
3 : But she can't get to an adjacent tile
1 : Right
2 : Right either way I won't have three so I think I should just
1 : Right
1 : Unshore
2 : I mean I can't unshore both of them.
1 : (--) powers
1 : What's your power?
2 : I mean I can move to like
2 : This is shore any one tile on the island so you don't have to be on it
1 : Oh ok.
2 : Can shore up any one tile before it sinks
2 : But can't be used ahhh
3 : Ok I
2 : Oh yeah
1 : Since we were trying to use
1 : this
2 : Right.
1 : Ah actually we don't have four either
2 : I mean I can move here and unshore that
1 : One, two, three. You'd have to stay here.
3 : I think
2 : I mean I could stay here and unshore it and I use this to unshore it.
1 : Yeah
3 : I'd
3 : I don't think that's the best think cause we don't have any
1 : We don't have (--) one more card yet for that.
1 : So it doesn't even do us any good.
3 : Yeah I think we should
3 : (--)
3 : She should send both of these to me
3 : And then I can just travel you know with my power or whatever
3 : And then I'll have three
1 : Where would you go?
3 : And then I can go here and then you can
1 : Wait
3 : And then
3 : And then you would give that to me
1 : Ok so the next time
3 : And then I would give these to you?
1 : I couldn't give it to you yeah cause you have to be on the same
1 : Place I have to exchange any cards.
3 : I thought you two would just be next to each other.
1 : Typically
1 : two
2 : No you have to be on the same tile
1 : yeah
3 : Oh ok well then you would just move there two or
1 : Yeah I would use one action to do that.
3 : Yeah
3 : So
1 : (change) your move
3 : You should give those two to me and then place this 
3 : maybe unsink something or do something else
1 : Wait which one are we talkin' about.
3 : This one
1 : I only have one
3 : And she has two
2 : right
2 : I can I can give them to him (--)
1 : So I know
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : So giving two cards, is that two actions?
3 : Ah wait
2 : Right, right this is two actions
3 : I have five so I would have to discard this
1 : Right
1 : When it's your turn so you can't do anything now gosh
3 : And this no I would do that now. Immediately when you got more than that
2 : Wait when are you allowed to discard?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh because it's your turn you could pass it back
3 : So I would have to discard these
3 : And I would get
2 : So is that what you want to do?
3 : Yeah it's the only thing really to do.
2 : Ok
3 : Um ok, so that's here and then that's
2 : I can give you these two for two actions
3 : Ok
1 : Three so make
2 : I can
1 : Ok yeah that makes sense
2 : Unsink
2 : I guess this one cause this is the one that's like immediate
3 : Yeah
2 : Danger in
2 : I that's it, no I have one more action left
1 : yeah
2 : because I have three
3 : No cause this counts as an action
2 : one two
2 : This doesn't count as an action
1 : three
1 : one two and then you just unsun oh and that's one right? So that's three?
2 : right so
1 : so you're done?
2 : Any request where to move?
3 : So either you could unsink this
1 : Wait can you still move though?
2 : Yes
1 : Wasn't that three actions?
2 : One, two this doesn't count as an action so I still have one more left.
3 : Yeah
1 : Couldn't you unshore this?
3 : That's that
1 : Oh with the ok ok.
3 : So you can either unshore this or move closer to where we'll be.
3 : Because unshoring this even if it's not useful.
2 : Yeah
3 : will still
3 : Like
3 : keep putting it back in the pile to stop other cards from getting flooded
2 : ok sure.
3 : So
2 : (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : You can just move me later.
2 : And then I draw these two
3 : Actually I can't cause I discarded that.
2 : oops sorry.
3 : So
2 : No but isn't that your power? Oh no it's not? Ok.
1 : How come?
3 : No I just move myself yeah.
2 : So now I have three of these an um
3 : Ok.
2 : You have to draw one, two.
2 : Three cards (--) yeah.
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah
2 : Cave of Embers
1 : Oh
1 : That right there.
3 : Ah here.
2 : Coral Palace God dammit
2 : I told you I should have sunk
2 : I should have unsunken this one. It's gone.
3 : What's that?
1 : Oh it's gone.
3 : Oh this.
1 : Ok.
2 : And discard that with it.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : ha
3 : Wait
3 : Ok yeah.
1 : This one, this one's gone?
1 : Cliffs of Abandon, um
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Was that the only treasure part for it or no?
2 : No there's Tidal
1 : One
1 : There's one more
2 : Palace
1 : Ok
2 : But you cannot get to it unless you are the Pilot or unless you have one of these now, because we don't have nanything
2 : next to it
2 : And we can't move diagonally unless you went all the way down like
1 : Youc ould
1 : No
1 : If you got some more there then yeah yeah.
2 : That's a lot of turns.
2 : It's your go.
1 : We don't have another card for that anyways
3 : Ok.
2 : One, two, three four I'm gonna
3 : We have to be on the same tile right? to exchange cards?
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : So that's one.
2 : But she can't give anything to you because it's
2 : It's
2 : Not her turn.
3 : Yeah
1 : Not yet.
2 : Right.
3 : That's fine she'll just discard the lions and then I'll give these to you thats.
3 : That's three turns.
3 : Ok.
2 : Ok.
1 : You're giving oh you're giving that to me. two?
3 : Yup
2 : So that because you're on that so next turn you can
2 : grab a treasure
2 : And you can give him one of those.
1 : I can discard.
1 : I have to discard these two
3 : Yep
2 : right
1 : So now it's my turn or have you/
1 : picked the flooding?
3 : oh
1 : the flooded cards or whatever?
3 : that as well
2 : cards and then
3 : just two yeah
2 : sorry I
2 : can't count
3 : Ok so we have four of these now

2 : Oh we already have three treasures, treasures done. Yeah.
3 : Oh we have oh
4 : Mmhmm. We're good on the Treasures yeah. Yeah we just gotta get home yeah.
3 : Oh we gotta get home. Oh alright just kidding.Ha ha ha, I'm done.
2 : We just have to get home. Yeah.
4 : Mmhmm.
2 : (--) other people.
2 : Now what does this do?
1 : Oh.
3 : Yeah.
3 : But we also need one (--) one to get off the island.
2 : She can get off (--) people back.
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah I can get off.
1 : So if you then move.
2 : Well how wait what does it do exactly?
1 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any one other tile.
3 : I can just.
2 : Oh so you can move one of these two people then.
2 : Then move um
3 : um
2 : Well green can get back by himself.
1 : (--)
2 : Why don't you move red back yeah.
1 : Can be used to fly one or more adventurers on the same tile.
2 : Right.
3 : yeah ok.
1 : So
2 : So you can't move both of you but you can move like one person.
3 : Yup.
1 : Yeah.
2 : (--)
3 : That's that and then I'm done.
3 : Wait was that one or two?
3 : It doesn't matter, just kidding. Ok.
2 : It doesn't matter yeah.
1 : That's (--).
3 : Ok
3 : We have a Sandbag (--) this thingy.
2 : Three of these.
3 : Yup.
2 : Whispering Garden, Cliffs of Abandon, Temple of the Sun
1 : Uh oh.
4 : Ah oh.
2 : So you get to swim right?
1 : Temple of the Sun is out
2 : (--)
1 : Um.
1 : Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon (--)
2 : Ok.
1 : You're up.
2 : So you can just (--) that
4 : 
4 : Ok so I'm gonna hop over and hang out with you guys until I get home.
4 : And
4 : And then there's really nothing else I need you to do well I can't shore up anything
2 : You can shore up.
4 : Um
1 : Ok
4 : So let's do some magic cards.
4 : Um and let's see what I have to flood.
4 : So the Watchtower, the Misty Marsh and the Dunes of Deception.
2 : And they're all gone so
3 : It's getting pretty full in here.
1 : That it?
1 : Mm.
2 : Alright let's
1 : Flyin' us out.
2 : That's it.
4 : Yeah.

2 : You're up Engineer
1 : Ah
3 : Hmm
1 : Do I have to take three actions?
3 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : Ah, what do you think you should do first?
3 : Maybe we should shore up
3 : some
2 : yeah I mean I think we should definitely use the special power every time
3 : Hmm
3 : Yeah
2 : So give up shore up two tiles
3 : yeah I don't
2 : yeah it has to be those two right?
3 : I mean you can still move on them like so she could move one and then shore up these two
2 : yeah that's very true
3 : But um, yeah because we don't know which cards are coming up.
1 : Now why?
1 : Did you get a chance to move these?
2 : Yeah you can only shore up things that are adjacent to you so you can either move first and then like shore up these two or shore up these ones right here.
1 : So can I move this way?
2 : You can move that way but then you can only shore up one
2 : and that one, presumably, if you're on it.
3 : Hmm
1 : Oh ok I see what you're saying, so I can move, I can shore these two up
2 : Yeah, yeah
2 : Or you could shore these two up right now and then not have to move,
2 : then do something else.
3 : Oh that's one action so she could move right after she shores up.
2 : Yeah, yeah, I mean you can move shore both of em up.
2 : So it's just a matter of which ones we wanna shore up first.
3 : So we could do is- Actually you could shore up these two right now
3 : then that's one action, and then move here
3 : That's- And then shore up the next two. I think that might be best
2 : And shore up the next two. Yeah, yeah, yeah do that
1 : Uh
3 : You agree?
1 : I'm sorta lost. Wouldn't that be four though?
3 : No, that's- that'd be um
2 : No, so you can move two per, two per turn. Sorry. So that's one move right there, those two.
2 : Second move is moving on this tile, third move is these two.
3 : Because you- That's your special, you can move two- you can shore up two um
2 : Two per one turn.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So it'd be the double shore up as one move, moving is one move, adn then the second double shore up is your third and final move.
1 : But I can only move two
1 : Right?
2 : Yeah, per one action. So one action, one action, one action, one action, one action.
2 : You can move mult- you can unshore multiple, multiple tiles per turn.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : That's an action. So like- You're speacial is like you can
2 : Yeah
3 : shore up two uh tiles and that's one action, and we have three actions. That's- um we have three actions, so you can shore up these two then you can move one right here.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : And then you can shore up these two and that'd be three actions total.
3 : And then you'd be down
2 : And you can shore up an unlimited number of things per turn, per three actions
3 : Mmhmm
2 : But per action you can do two, but we can only do one.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok, yeah, so let me see what's happening
1 : Ok now then I move here
2 : Oh, yeah right there.
3 : Yeah right there, that one there
1 : And then
3 : You can shore up those two again
2 : And then those two
1 : Mmhmm
2 : cause you can do two at a time
3 : (--)
1 : And then now what?
2 : So that's your third move, so then you
3 : And then you would- Yeah and then you would stay there and then you would pick up two of these.
1 : just stay there.
2 : You're done, yeah.
3 : Uh yeah you can see it.
1 : And then
2 : So what are they
1 : Uh yeah and then fire
2 : Well you got a Water's Rise. Alright so
3 : Oo
2 : Alright so just hold onto the fire one, we'll notch this baby up,
2 : shuffle these,
3 : Now that goes over here
2 : Shuffle these
2 : throw that on top.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : And then she has to draw two.
2 : Yeah, you have to draw two of those- Yeah two of them.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Which ones?
1 : Mm now I put these here
2 : Alright Gold Gate
3 : Uh
1 : So I have to move to the Gold Gate
2 : No- They- It gets flooded
3 : No, no
1 : Oh wait, wait, wait
3 : those get flooded, so
3 : Um
2 : Where's Gold Gate, Gold Gate, Gold Gate?
2 : Maybe
1 : No here.
2 : Yeah here it is. Alright so it's, so it's gone now. Alright
3 : No. Oh that's gone.
2 : So that gets tossed in here and then
3 : Mmhmm
3 : what's the next one?
2 : Uh Phantom Rock, that gets tossed too.
3 : Oh right.
2 : Oh, that's unfortunate.
3 : Yeah
2 : So uh, alright, so I'm up then.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright so give treasure cards- I don't uh so who has what?
3 : We don't have yeah
2 : I guess I'll give, I'll give her
1 : The fire
2 : that one
3 : Oh yeah because she- Yeah, that's one action.
2 : So then uh what else can I do? I can move,
2 : shore up
2 : so I
3 : Um
3 : Mm
2 : I can't shore up anything around me.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so should I just move onto her
3 : Maybe you could just um
3 : Yeah maybe uh move onto the same- He, he's right here.
1 : Where are you?
2 : Yeah I'll, I'll just move this way cause I have a lion's card, that way I'll just move onto there.
3 : Oh ok, yeah
2 : Yeah I'm just closer
2 : Alright so now I'll take two treasures, right?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Perfect
3 : Nice
3 : and then two yeah.
2 : Temple of the Moon,
3 : Oh that's right here.
2 : then Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Ok, you're up.
3 : Alright
3 : Um I have this
2 : So Pilot
1 : Well wait, (wasn't that bad) because now isn't it flooded?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah it's flooded but you can still stand on it.
3 : The problem is if, if the um
2 : If we get a Water's Rise and it goes back in and we get the same card again, it goes away.
3 : we get the Rise again
3 : and then
3 : Yeah so we need to worry about when this card comes out again
3 : then we have to worry about if any cities are flooded then we need to
2 : Sandbag
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Sandbag or you- When it's your turn you can start shoring up.
2 : So I'm gonna save, I'm gonna save this.
3 : I think that's the best for an Engineer, you can just start shoring up a lot of places.
2 : Yeah, whatever you just shore up.
3 : Mm
2 : So I don't think you really need to
2 : move anywhere. I mean you
3 : I think we still, I think we might have to do- Oh take up to three actions um
3 : Yeah I'll just move over and just yeah
2 : Yeah yeah, might as well.
3 : Yeah
3 : and then uh that's two
3 : And
2 : Then you can move anywhere so- Wait, what you'd wanna go to a uh
3 : Here
2 : one of these places since you have the
3 : Yeah, I might as well
3 : um
3 : Yeah
2 : You can go to- These are the only two I'm assuming.
3 : Right
3 : Yeah, I'll do this.
2 : Oh and if
3 : Uh um
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright, if one of the treasure- We have to make sure if one of the treasure things gets flooded that we shore it up immediately, or as soon as possible.
3 : Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : Ok
2 : Alright so then you take two.
3 : Uh I got a Helicopter Lift and then I got this.
2 : Might as well just put one of those to the side too for when the game's over. Just so that we don't use it.
3 : I can
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah yeah
3 : And then- Oh yeah two.
3 : Lost Lagoon
2 : (--) Cliffs of Abandon.
3 : Oh, Cities of Abandon, yeah.
2 : Alright, so you're up.
2 : Engineer.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mm that's a
1 : Where could I go?
2 : Move down
2 : and
3 : Yeah I was thinking, move down, do the sh-
2 : Yeah, and then those two
3 : Cause I have this card, so I'm gonna give this to- Oh wait she's gonna have
3 : Wait, she yeah- she can
3 : Cause I think next- I think if she draws her next two treasure cards she might get one of those fire or one of these.
3 : There's a chance for that so
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, so I mean, you might as well just give her the card.
3 : Yeah well once it my turn, I can yeah
2 : Oh yeah it's not your turn.
1 : Alright so if I move down here
3 : Mmhmm
2 : That's a move.
1 : then I can shore this up
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And Temple of the Moon, in the same turn.
3 : You can do both, yeah.
2 : It's your special power.
1 : Well don't- But don't you get them shore up too?
2 : Yeah, but he can only do one at a time.
3 : Yeah we get to shore up, we only, we only can do one at a time. That's the, that's the Engineer's like specialty.
2 : You could do two at a time.
1 : Oh ok, so I can do two you both can do one.
3 : Mm yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : And that was two, you can do
2 : You have one more move, so you can either move onto the Cave of Shadows, Lost Lagoon, Bronze Gate, Temple of the Moon, or Dunes of Deception
2 : But not Bronze Gate.
3 : I think you should move here because you would get closer to me actually.
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah sorry you could do that.
1 : Oh where are you? You're the blue.
3 : I'm right here
2 : Oh especially since you have the red cards too.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So you could draw two of
1 : Then I also have the chalices
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah but you're not around it, you can't move onto that.
1 : Why not?
3 : Now you
2 : Because it's diagonal.
3 : because you can't move diagonal
3 : so you can't move- you were here so you can't move here yet you have to move
3 : Um
1 : Wait a minute, you said I'm here
3 : Uh
2 : You were here, but you only had one move, you can't move diagonally, you can only move
3 : You were
1 : Uh huh
2 : left, right, up and down
1 : Mmhmm
2 : so
3 : That's why we moved here.
2 : Yeah, that's why you moved there.
1 : Oh ok, so I- Another time I can move here?
3 : Mmhmm yeah, next turn yeah. Yeah
2 : Yeah, now you can, yeah, but here's your two cards.
3 : Um
2 : So what did I get? Uh perfect
3 : Oo perfect. Oh wait that's six, so you need to discard one of them.
2 : Uh no
2 : Get rid of the Earth the stone yeah
3 : The stone
1 : This one, yeah.
3 : The stone,
2 : Yeah
3 : And then
3 : two
3 : these
1 : So now I have to put Whispering Garden back
1 : um where it was.
2 : Whispering Garden
3 : Yeah
2 : What's the other one?
1 : Eh Iron Gate
3 : Ok
2 : And those go over here.
1 : And here
2 : No Whispering Garden we have to- Should I sandbag that right now?
2 : Oh I'm next to it so
3 : No, not yet
3 : I don't- I think we can use that anytime
3 : so I think once we get like uh
2 : Alright so should I just undo it right now? Just
3 : Oh yeah you can do that, yeah do that
2 : So that's my first move now my second treasure card.
2 : Uh I don't have any
3 : You can also do this if you want to
2 : Yeah
3 : That's two.
2 : And no one else has these ones so there's no real, no real point
3 : No I- No yeah. You can move somewhere if you want.
2 : Us
2 : I'm gonna move back on that. Might as well
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : so two of these.
2 : (--)
3 : Three
3 : Yeah
2 : Three, oh yeah
2 : Whispering Garden again, so flip me over, if you don't mind.
3 : Oh that was good.
2 : Uh Breaker's Bridge
2 : next to her. Uh Engineer.
3 : Oh right
2 : It's Engineer and Iron Gate's done with.
3 : Oh man
3 : Oh
3 : Ok yeah, mmhmm
2 : K yup
3 : Alright
3 : um
2 : So you're here
3 : I could
3 : go over here, give her
3 : a chalice
3 : and then she would have to get rid of one of the fires
3 : the fire um
3 : treasure
3 : if we wanna do that.
1 : Now how come
3 : And then she could- and then on her next turn she can go here and then take a- get the treasure, you know.
2 : Get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 : But
1 : why can you go from here to here?
2 : Cause he's the Pilot.
3 : Because I'm a Pilot, I can uh move anywhere.
1 : You can fly anywhere. Oh ok
3 : Yeah
2 : You can- One move
3 : Yeah one move, yeah once.
2 : But you can't take any more right?
3 : No I can't take it- Only this is the uh
2 : Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok
2 : So you might as well yeah, go there, give that to her.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : And then uh
2 : And then Breaker's Bridge
1 : Mmhmm
3 : (--)
3 : yeah and then
3 : Um yeah might as well.
2 : I mean, yeah uh
3 : That's three
2 : Yup
2 : Two of those
3 : Um
3 : Yeah,.
3 : I guess
3 : Uh Temple of the Moon,
3 : uh Cliffs of Abandon,
3 : and Lost Lagoon is over there.
2 : You're up Engineer.
1 : So now I can move down here.
3 : Yeah you can move down there.
2 : Yeah
3 : And then
2 : Cash in those four.
3 : You can
2 : Those four chalices over there. And we can take this.
3 : Yeah I think so, yeah
2 : So this is ours.
2 : So we'll discard those
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
3 : Now is what- (--)
2 : Does that count as a turn though?
3 : Um
2 : Yup, capture a treasure, yup.
3 : Ok, so that was two.
2 : So, that's two turns right there.
2 : So
2 : Back to Cave of Shadows so she can
1 : Well wait a minute, wait a minute,
1 : I
2 : So you moved. You moved down to Coral Palace.
1 : Yeah but I didn't shore up two tiles.
2 : You don't have to shore up anything.
2 : I mean you don't have to
1 : Why?
2 : Because we wanna get the treasure.
3 : Yeah our main mission is to get the treasure and
2 : Yeah
3 : to get three of the- at least three of the treasures and then we're trying to fly back home.
2 : So it's more important to get that treasure than to shore up those two things.
3 : For right now, cause we're gonna need to do that later.
2 : Yeah
2 : So you moved as one move,
1 : Mmhmm
2 : got the treasure as your second move,
2 : now your third move
2 : could either move to one of those three or to that one, that way you can shore up either one of them next time.
1 : Ok
2 : So you can't shore up anything right now since you're not adjacent to any sunken- So your only choice is to move somewhere.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : We could, uh I mean I don't think we have to, but we could move this. And then she could just like shore up
3 : with two of them. But I don't think
2 : Yeah, oh yeah, to Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Might now have to worry about them
3 : Mmhmm
1 : But why would you use that now, the Helicopter?
2 : The
3 : I mean
2 : That way, that way you would be able to shore up these two and that way the Temple of the Moon wouldn't get lost
3 : Yeah, is that popped up actually? The Temple, oh
2 : Yeah it's
2 : it's still in, it's right here.
3 : Ok
2 : So that's, that'd probably be- that's a good move actually. But make sure we don't use
2 : the second Helicopter.
3 : Yeah
3 : because- Or we could wait for this- the thing to pop up and then right away just use the sandbags.
2 : Oh yeah we have a sandbag too.
3 : Yeah
3 : so she could just move up and then just- we can save our Helicopter Lifts.
2 : But then if she moves up she can only do one of those, as opposed to
3 : Right,
3 : that's true.
2 : So what do we want to do? Get the two now and
3 : Yeah, I think- Yeah we can do that.
2 : bust it out.
3 : Yeah
2 : do you mind if
2 : Sweet,
3 : Yeah do you, do you wanna do that? Do you know what- We were trying to use a Helicopter Lift so you get here right away
3 : and that doesn't take an action, so you still have one more action
3 : and then we can shore up these two.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So then we don't have to worry about them dissapearing.
1 : Ok, so now I'm going back here and then I'm gonna put these
2 : Alright
2 : so discard the Helicopter, so now you're there,
3 : Mmhmm
2 : cause he used that for you.
2 : Mmhmm, those two. Cause that's your special power, (to open) two.
1 : Like this?
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : So now
2 : you get two of these
2 : and then three of these.
3 : That was four.
2 : What? Yeah
3 : Mm, yeah
1 : So now Copper Gate,
1 : Crimson Forest, and I have to turn those over.
2 : Which ones?
1 : Coral Palace- Or no, Copper Gate,
3 : Oh right here, I got it.
1 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Mmhmm
1 : and Temple of the Sun.
3 : Temple of the Sun, ok.
2 : Oh, I have to sandbag that one soon.
3 : Yeah
2 : K, so my turn.
2 : So
2 : I shouldn't- I should give you this treasure card right?
3 : I'm- We can't- Oh you can. Oh yeah you can.
2 : That's my power, so here, take that.
3 : One
2 : So then, I'm- I flip him
3 : (--)
3 : Yeah, that's probably the best idea.
2 : Flip Whispering Garden, (--)
3 : (--)
3 : You- Or you can in- You could flip
2 : I can flip- Yeah (--)
3 : this one.
3 : I think that's the only thing you can do actually.
2 : (--) I don't wanna move.
2 : Yeah, that's it, alright.
3 : Oh man.
2 : And we only have eighteen minutes.
3 : Yeah
3 : What is that?
3 : Aw man- Oh
2 : Are we allowed to-
2 : Can we sandbag it?
3 : Yeah- Oh yeah
3 : Can we- Is that allowed? Can we like sandbag before um
2 : Uh
3 : Mm
2 : (--)
2 : Aw
3 : Ok
2 : No. Alright
2 : Good call, thank you.
2 : Ah Copper Gate,
2 : let's see, Copper Gate.
3 : Oh is-
3 : Oh man
2 : It's devestating.
3 : Yeah
2 : Temple of the Moon ooo, we gotta shore that, shore that.
3 : Yeah, we need that- Oh, yeah we need that.
2 : Don't whatever we do, can't lose it.
3 : Yeah
2 : That was mine, so you're up.
3 : Um did you
3 : pick up these two?
3 : Oh ok
2 : Yeah
2 : That and the Rising Water.
3 : Um
2 : So
3 : I mean I could give this
2 : To me
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah give that to me.
2 : Cause then she can give that to me and I can immediately cash out on that.
3 : Yeah but can I
3 : Don't, don't I have to fly over there to give it to you?
3 : Or is that
2 : Oh yeah
2 : yeah you would have to.
3 : Yeah
2 : So you could fly, then give it to me, that's two turns.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And then you could- Could you fly back?
3 : I meand I could fly back here, yeah
3 : The problem is like if she has the other one, but she's pretty far away from you, she would have to take- Unless she
2 : Oh yeah it's true.
2 : You could-
2 : she's not on the
2 : She's not close to that either though.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Could we Helicopter- Oh we already used the Helicopter. No
3 : Yeah
2 : If I meet her in the middle maybe?
3 : Yeah, maybe.
3 : So I think
3 : what I should do is
3 : fly over here,
2 : Fly, give
3 : give it to-
3 : That's two and then maybe
3 : go down, or something. Or fly somewhere else.
2 : Or fly back
3 : Yeah and then maybe on your turn you could um
3 : mm
3 : I have
2 : So well, she would have to move- She could
3 : Oh wait, she could move here and then upshore, upshore that
2 : Double, yeah
2 : And then move one more.
3 : And then move one more. Yeah that might
2 : And then I would meet her at Misty Marsh and I
1 : But wouldn't I have to
1 : turn this one over?
3 : Hm?
1 : If I move up
1 : won't I have to flood that?
3 : No, no, no, no
2 : No, you don't have to flood anything. You never flood unless it gets picked from that.
2 : That's the only way you get flooded something
1 : Oh
3 : So you like- Yeah you can flood the one on you're on top of, I'm pretty sure, and then you can do this one.
2 : Yeah, ok, so you just wanna fly, give me that, ok
3 : Yeah, I'll do that. That's one.
2 : One,
3 : two,
2 : Two
3 : And then
2 : Uh
3 : do you want me to
2 : You could- I mean
1 : But, can't I give you this one?
3 : Yeah, you have to be- But you have to be next- on the same tile as he is.
2 : Yeah, but you have to be on the same tile.
3 : So I flew over here, gave him the card, and then I'm gonna move some
2 : I'm the only person that can give a card without being on the same tile since I'm the Messenger.
2 : You two have to be on the same tile
1 : Mmhmm
2 : to give me a card.
3 : And I'm probably gonna go
2 : You can go to the Temple of the Moon since that's what you have
3 : That's true, yeah
2 : Oh and then
3 : Oh, right, right, right
3 : Oh yeah, we would have- Yeah I would have- Yeah just go down there, yeah
2 : Oh ok
2 : so it's just (--) Misty Marsh? Ok, thank you.
2 : So you're at- Oh you gotta pick your
3 : Oh right
3 : Oh nice
3 : Oh nice another Helicopter Lift. Wait one, two, three, four- Oh wait I needa, I needa
2 : Oh word, that's
2 : Uh you gotta drop the sandbag man.
3 : Drop the sandbag?
2 : I got a sandbag
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah the Helicopter's crucial if we wanna
3 : Yeah
2 : execute this plan.
3 : And- Oh yeah, three.
3 : Crimson Forest, alright got it.
3 : Um, Lost Lagoon
3 : and Breaker's Bridge. Oh man
2 : Alright
2 : so
2 : you're up Engineer.
1 : So why can't I
1 : move here
3 : Mmhmm
1 : and then I would be closer to here.
3 : Because you don't have the,
3 : these three cards
1 : But I have this card, so how come I can't give it to him?
2 : Because you're not on the same tile.
3 : Because you need to- You have to be, you have to be on the same tile.
1 : Oh, so I gotta go all the way up here.
3 : Yeah
3 : so I was think-
2 : So we could Helicopter you.
3 : Yeah that might be a good choice.
3 : But we- Alright
2 : And then we immediatley cash in
2 : on that
3 : Oh wait
1 : But then we would have two treasures.
3 : Oh we should- You know what we should do? So we go up here um
2 : Yeah, that's good.
2 : Flood uh shore up.
3 : Shore up, that's two. Helicopter over here and then trade that, that's three.
2 : Give- Yeah that's three. That's perfect yeah that's what we have to do.
3 : You're uh you wanna do that?
1 : So now
2 : Just go up one, that's one move. Shore up those two
1 : Move up here
3 : Yeah
3 : and then
1 : These two
3 : Yeah
2 : Uh huh
2 : And City- I mean or Breaker's Bridge, whichever one. But that one's closer to the middle so
1 : Ok
2 : And then
3 : And then we use the Helicopter Lift
2 : helicopter
3 : and then
2 : We're on the same thing
3 : Right here
1 : And I give you this
3 : Mmhmm and that's three. That's three turns
2 : Three turns
3 : And then you get two
3 : Oh nice, that's perfect
1 : Oh wow
2 : Wow
2 : Alright well, there you go.
1 : So now I have to do Whispering (--)
1 : or Garden
1 : So now I sunk us didn't I?
2 : No
3 : No, not yet, it just flooded.
2 : We're flooded.
2 : But can't you get the thing if you're flooded.
3 : I think so, um
2 : Can- You may catch the thing on a flooded tile. Alright, that's perfect.
3 : Ok
1 : And Tidal Place
2 : Huh?
3 : Oh Tidal Palace, alright
1 : Palace.
3 : Yeah
2 : So, I'm gonna cash it on the, on the
3 : Mmhmm
2 : What, what's this dude, the wind dude?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So those go away, that's one.
3 : And then
1 : Oh who's turn is it?
3 : It was his turn.
2 : It's my turn still so I have two moves left.
1 : Oh ok
2 : Oh
2 : Oh, I did have way too many
2 : I had four of these
2 : Oh yeah, I had
2 : Why don't you take four of- You have to get rid of this one. Yeah we would have it.
3 : Oh you just get rid of that one cause we already have that- Yeah sorry.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So then four, alright
3 : Yeah
2 : So then we have sandbags
2 : um
2 : so I just have to move twice or I could
3 : You, you could
2 : unshore
2 : I mean shore up.
3 : This I don't think we need anymore because- Yeah
2 : We don't need anymore, so might as well move
3 : down and then
2 : Do we have to be on
2 : Fool's Landing to leave?
3 : Ye
2 : No
3 : No, no, we just have to have this card and then we all have to be- we
2 : Yeah, yeah, ok
3 : probably all have to be on the same tile at the end.
3 : Hm
1 : But, we have to have- be on Fool's Landing to win.
3 : because you don't have- You only can move um
3 : But the Helicopter (--) only can move- If we're all on the same tile we can all move together but
3 : if we're in different tiles we can't win, so
2 : Ok
2 : So uh I guess we should try and stick together if we all have to be on the same tile.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : So um, yeah I think you should just move down
3 : and maybe (lift) this up.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : Alright, Dunes of Deception
3 : Oh
3 : ok
2 : Cave of Shadows,
1 : Um
1 : I think
1 : we have a lot of floods.
2 : Hm?
3 : Yeah but
3 : It's it's fine if we have a lot of floods as long as they don't get
3 : these treasure because- cause we have the straight path towards it.
2 : And Silver Gate
3 : Silver Gate
2 : Ok, none of those, none of those matter.
3 : Uh oh wait, one, two, three
2 : because
2 : Yeah, that's rough.
2 : If she
3 : Oh man
2 : Oh
2 : got it. Wait if you move onto it and then you Helicopter, or
3 : I can't Helicopter anyone, yeah, yeah
2 : You can't, you can't Pilot with someone? Ah
3 : I mean we could sandbag that
3 : just to be safe.
3 : And then
2 : You want to?
3 : and then she just moves here and then we'll- we just have to wait two more turns.
3 : You know what I'm saying? And then we just- Because this is the last thing we need
2 : Yeah
3 : to (--) and then
2 : Yeah
2 : So we just need to get here there as soon as possible.
3 : Yeah
2 : So sandbag it, just
3 : Just to be safe I guess. Or
2 : If we sandbag it now, there's, there's
2 : no way that it can
2 : It could come back but then it would just be
3 : Mmhmm and then it would just be flooded. And then we'll be on top- like right next to her, yeah (--)
1 : But
2 : Well yeah, yeah, yeah so
1 : can I be here and then
1 : turn these over?
2 : Yeah but you uh- it takes moves to move that, move there.
3 : You, you
2 : You can't- Yeah you still have to be adjacent to him
2 : to
2 : shore up, shore them up
2 : So should I use this?
3 : Is it
1 : Huh?
3 : I think
1 : I thought I could move
1 : to- I could shore up
1 : two tiles for one action.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah but you still have to be adajcent to them.
2 : You still have to be next to them.
3 : You have to be next to them. So these don't really- Like we don't need these anymore because we already have the, we already got the treasure
2 : We already got that treasure.
2 : This is what we care about, that's what we need.
3 : So we need this last treasure- And you, cause you have four of them already
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So we wanna take this
2 : So we're
2 : Should I do this?
3 : Yeah I think you should do that.
2 : But
2 : it's your turn.
3 : And then- So
3 : We're thinking we should move over, move here
2 : You just wanna move there right now?
3 : and uh move
1 : So you're gonna fly me there?
3 : I can't fly you there because
1 : You're gonna fly yourself there?
3 : No, no, you're gonna move like one, two, three right there, that
2 : Yeah
2 : But we're gonna be there to Helicopter out whenever you get there. So you should move there right now.
3 : Yeah, so
3 : so you should move here, right here, and then-
2 : Well it's your turn.
3 : Oh it's my turn?
2 : Yeah
2 : I just, I just, I just pulled- I just drew those.
3 : Wait wasn't it
3 : Oh it's my turn?
2 : Yeah I just flooded
3 : Oh right, right, ok
2 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, so you're up.
3 : So um
2 : Well I could
2 : oh
2 : I should've given you one of these and you could've moved right there and got
3 : That's true.
3 : Mm
3 : Yeah, I don't know.
3 : I think it's a- Oh yeah it might be faster, you're right.
2 : (--)
3 : Mm
2 : And then she can just go one, two, three
3 : Mm right
2 : So
2 : just hop on that tile, yeah, hop, just get on that tile yeah.
3 : And then yeah, oh right, yeah, that was a bad- yeah whatever.
2 : Well I mean you, we can still do it.
3 : That's true.
2 : And that way, that way she can move there.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And then she'll- I, I'll be set
2 : whenever I
3 : Well, well, you're, you're turn's already gone so you can't give me that card, unless we trade.
2 : Yeah but I mean after her turn I could just give you, giveyou the card.
3 : Actually, can we trade this
3 : for that, that thing
3 : right now?
2 : Mm
2 : What do you mean?
3 : Oh wait, sorry, sorry, so um
2 : So
2 : I'm saying you move there
3 : Ok
3 : One, two
2 : But wait, don't, I mean, don't do it yet. You know- One, two
3 : Or one
3 : Yeah
2 : You move there and then unshore something or shore up something.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Oh, yeah
2 : She plays, she plays her- She moves there
3 : Ok, I, I get what you're saying
2 : I move, I move there or whatever, give you this thing, you cash in on that
3 : Yeah yeah
2 : we Helicopter outta here, we win.
3 : Yeah, yeah, we win. Alright
2 : Alright so
2 : get there.
3 : Well, that's- I'll use one right there. And then, that's one.
2 : And then shore something up,
2 : or whatever.
3 : Two
2 : So then
3 : I can do two, cause I Helicoptered there so
2 : Oh ok ok
3 : And then I could just do this (--)
2 : Yeah whatever.
2 : So then
2 : you just move there,
2 : that's all you need to do.
3 : And then I needa-
3 : Wait hold on well I need to
2 : Oh we still need to do all that nonsense.
3 : Yeah
3 : Uh I- One, two, three, four, five, six. I need- I'll just get rid of this.
2 : This is what could mess us up.
3 : Oh right here.
3 : And then- Oh yeah, three.
3 : Uh Bronze Gate,
3 : uh Howling Garden is gone
3 : Oh wait that's not Howling Garden
3 : Howling Garden
3 : and then Cave of Embers,
3 : which we don't need.
2 : So then
2 : so then you move
2 : to the Temple of the Moon.
3 : Yeah yeah
3 : you move over here.
2 : Yeah, that's all I need to do.
2 : So there's that
3 : And then she needs to do that.
2 : And then
2 : you need to do this.
1 : But now
3 : And then you have to get-
3 : Well what are those two?
3 : Can I see those two cards?
1 : Hm?
3 : What
1 : Well one's a Helicopter Lift and other one's a Water Rise
3 : You
3 : you can um
2 : So just put, so you got the Hel-
3 : Get rid of one of the fires, we can just- Uh
2 : Well you just- She has five, that's fine.
3 : That's just a- Oh yeah you have five. Oh wait you don't have to get rid of anything- Oh because of the flood card, right
1 : So what am I getting rid of?
2 : You don't have to get rid of anything
2 : You don't
2 : Cause the water- This gets played immediately,
3 : Ok
2 : you know?
3 : mmhmm.
2 : And then
1 : So I have to rise the water
2 : Yeah rise the water
3 : Is it four?
2 : And then I already picked those, so
3 : Is it four or three? Oh it's still three.
2 : Is it- It's still three.
3 : Ok, that's still get
3 : I think we still got this because we still have this card right here.
2 : Yeah, we still got this, yeah
2 : Two, three
1 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Yeah um that's gone.
3 : Can I
1 : Dunes of Deceit
1 : Deception, rather.
2 : Yeah, that's gone.
1 : And Cave of Shadows.
3 : Alright
2 : Alright so then
3 : nice.
2 : I'm
3 : Alright
2 : give you this
3 : Right
2 : I move one
2 : I move two
3 : Mmhmm and then you're good.
2 : I flip something
3 : One, two, three, four, five (--) get rid of it.
3 : Oh wait can we have five cards?
2 : Yeah, you can have
3 : Oh five, right- Oh six right yeah.
2 : But, but six, yeah, yeah. So I'll just flip that for fun.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So then cash in on that
2 : Oh I gotta do this.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : (--)
3 : Three
2 : Alright Cliffs of Abandon,
3 : Right here
2 : uh Whispering Garden
2 : (--) is gone, Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Whispering Garden
2 : I love it.
3 : Thanks
2 : So then, yeah
2 : Cash in
3 : And then my (--) cash this in
3 : and then
3 : can we just Helicopter Lift outta here?
3 : Or I could just- To be safe, to be safe I could Helicopter here and then she can Helicopter
2 : Well let me look at the
3 : Oh ok
2 : Discard (--). Yeah, discard it.
3 : Mm
2 : And we're, we're done.
3 : Or we could
3 : have- use a Helicopter Lift right here
2 : Wait, hold on
2 : Then one, one player must discard a Helicopter Lift
2 : (--) to fly your team of the Foridden Island
2 : for the win.
3 : Oh so we have to be, we have to be in Fool's Landing I guess.
2 : Oh do we?
3 : I, I could use the Helicopter Lift
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
3 : here and she can use her Helicopter Lift and then it just (--). Yeah
2 : Yeah, might as well do it. Yeah, yeah, do it.
3 : And then Hel- And then you use- you can use that anytime and then we
2 : Oh to the Fool's Landing tile, I should've read that, yeah.
3 : Oh wait
1 : Mm
3 : And then we use the Helicopter Lift
2 : Alright, yeah.
2 : Well you still have to do this then
1 : For what?
1 : Isn't that where we wanna be?
3 : No, but you- No she doesn't have to use it- It doesn't have to be her turn doesn't it?
2 : Yeah, yeah, you're right, yeah.
2 : But then yeah
3 : So then we use it for that and then we
2 : And then discard
3 : we win.

1 : Ok so, I go first then.
3 : K.
1 : Um
2 : So I think we should like
2 : Figure out which tile's the most important to definitely maintain and not be sunk.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Ah then the others, so like for example, I think this one can be ok but we have to keep in mind that we don't have
3 : Yeah I don't want to get stranded too, so we should probably take care of this area.
1 : Yeah. I think
2 : Yeah so we've got them
1 : I think we should maximize saving bascially the board and then the cards will kind of come and then we can get close to each other when we need to sort of
2 : And then you gotta keep in mind though that each time we keep playing it draws a flood so it's going to get more and more so we have to be efficient with everything as well
1 : Yeah.
1 : Ok um
2 : mm
1 : So
1 : I guess I'll use my first action to shore up both these two cause they're just right next to me
1 : And I can use my thing more than once right?
2 : Um yes (name$$$) you can do, yeah so you can do two and then you can move and do two if you wanted to
1 : Ok
1 : So these are adjacent so I might as well do these two
1 : Then I can
1 : move here
2 : Ok
1 : As my second action and then I can get these two also
2 : Ok so it'd be three actions ok
1 : And that's all three and then I get two treasure cards
2 : You get a Water's Rise.
1 : Ok Water's rise and then I got the Chalice.
1 : Oh so
1 : This goes in the discard right? And then
2 : Yeah
2 : (--)
2 : We have to shuffle all these and put them on top then?
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah so
2 : I do
2 : You're shuffling incorrectly
2 : Put 'em on top
2 : and draw two.
1 : Alright Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon.
2 : Alright so Gold Gate is then
3 : Yeah
2 : sunk
1 : that's sucks
2 : and then that takes with the card itself so Gold gate
2 : Yup and what was that Lost Lagoon?
3 : Yeah
1 : No it's over here again
2 : Ok
1 : Ok cool alright so now we defintely gotta make sure we don't
2 : So it's flooded
1 : No never mind, I thought that was a treasure card, never mind.
2 : Ok so now it's my turn?
1 : Ok.
1 : Um
1 : Yeah
2 : Yup alright so three actions so
2 : um
2 : let me see here
2 : you're at Whispering Garden, you're at Fool'sLanding, you have one chalice, you don't
2 : (--) count as an action or I can move, um
3 : hmm.
2 : What do you guys think I should do?
1 : I think
1 : Huh
1 : You could move, I don't think giving a card at this point would necessarily help because if you give one to me because I can only hold five you know what I mean then I'm I already got two of these.
2 : right true so you have one
3 : So if you
3 : can move twice it would be two actions? And then you could
1 : Yeah
3 : Shore up Lost Lagoon maybe?
1 : yeah and then you'll still be next to me and I could give you this
2 : Ok and you're able to
3 : Or I could fly you guys over, but I don't know if I want to use it.
2 : So you're able to me a treasure card if it's on the same, if we're on the same tile. Ok.
1 : Yeah whenever it comes back to my turn
2 : Ok so you guys want me to save Lost Lagoon? Is that hte most important thing to you?
2 : Cause I would argue that Lost Lagoon is not that important.
2 : Um because
2 : It's not necessary for us to really
1 : Yeah it's definitely true. Do you think moving to the center of the map so maybe you have more accessibility to other places might be better?
2 : Yeah I think that'd be good cause then I can we'd have better opportunity for us you can move anywhere you want, but for us like to flip to make sure we shore up cards um as it comes, so I'll probably move um
2 : I'll move twice and I'll move to phantom Rock cause that doesn't really matter that much. Is that are those the only two flooded cards that you have?
1 : Yeah it looks like it
3 : Hmm
2 : Ok so I'll move
1 : less
1 : yeah not yet ok
2 : I can move to Copper Gate
2 : Ah twice and then um
2 : I don't have to shore up anything. So that's all I can, I don't have to do anything else really.
2 : yeah.
2 : So I'll just do that. I'll move twice and then 'll just finish my turn. Is that ok with everyone?
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Yeah it's good with me.
2 : Alright. I'll do that.
2 : Two treasures.
2 : So I have ah Sandbags.
2 : So I can play at any time.
2 : And this is shore up any one tile ok. So we'll keep that and I have one of these so I'm the only with these two so far so keep that in mind. Alright, and then
1 : Ok gottcha
1 : Gottcha
2 : Draw two floods
2 : so we have Breaker's Bridge and phantom Rock, so Breaker's Bridge is sunk.
3 : Oh no
2 : and you take that as well
1 : Breaker's Bridge is
1 : right here
2 : Ok so that's, thoses two are flooded so
1 : Alright
1 : Alright cool
2 : Ok cool your turn
1 : right
3 : Alright um
3 : Let's see
3 : I could
3 : I could shore up those cause I can move
3 : as one of my actions I can move wherever.
2 : Right that's
3 : (--) but if those aren't
3 : our main concern
3 : Um
1 : I think shoring up this, I think having the
1 : out doesn't really matter and makes the game board smaller in terms of like leaving places.
3 : Yeah
1 : plus it's like if Lost Lagoon comes up it's just like
1 : not having to worry about losing one of the important ones kind of
3 : mmhmm.
2 : So you, you could choose to move to a use a special ability you could choose to move one over and then still be able to shore it up cause it's adjacent to you. So you could have those choices.
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah true.
1 : I think that's probably our best bet.
3 : Alright so maybe I'll do that.
2 : Yup ok
1 : Alright.
1 : And then
2 : Do you want to take a third action or
3 : One two, um
2 : No I can
3 : (--)
1 : Yeah
3 : Don't know what elses I'd do
1 : (--) want the wind so I think
2 : You can move one more if you want so you can move back so you can cover this area but that's up to you
3 : Um
2 : Cause right now cause you guys are
2 : sort of adjacent diagonally I don't know if that's if you want to cover (--) area of not. That's up to you.
3 : maybe I'll move back just cause (--)
2 : Ok
3 : actions ok um
2 : Because that
1 : Yeah that's fine with me.
1 : Alright so now you get two cards.
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Two cards
3 : So, another helicopter lift.
3 : And one of the Treasures.
1 : Ok so I have two of the fires, so I need to get the fire from you as soon as I can.
2 : Ok so you have two of them
3 : And then
2 : which means you guys have to be on the same tile eventually
3 : we mixed those back in the
2 : oh not yet cause we didn't get a Flood right?
3 : flood thing?
3 : I think you
3 : do you still draw even if you don't get those?
1 : Yeah you still draw it no matter what.
2 : You still draw two, but we don't shuffle them. So you have two of these yeah
3 : You don't mix it back up? Ok.
1 : I'll have to shuffle it back up.
3 : Right so Cliffs of Abandon, and Whispering Garden.
1 : Whispering Garrden's where I am.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Nice, that's convenient. Ok so let's just put them right here then. Ok.
1 : Cool.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Ok so it's my turn. I should get to you so I can
1 : Do we have to be on the same one or adjacent?
2 : You got to be on the same one
3 : Yeah
1 : On the same one?
2 : That's true yup.
1 : Ok
1 : um
1 : I could
2 : and
1 : get there but it would take me all three of my moves and then
2 : You can keep in mind that she can fly to you at any point as well.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : She can fly at any point to me? She doesn't have to be
2 : Yeah any tile
2 : Yeah she can she's ah
1 : and not even your turn?
3 : it has to be my turn
2 : well it has to be her turn but it's (--) you can technically move any you want and she can always get to you.
3 : but
1 : Ok
1 : True and if I get one more card or two more I'll still be at five so I won't have to discard anything. See that's fine. I can then
2 : Right.
1 : Ah
1 : I guess I can just
1 : take these two as my first action
2 : Hmmm
1 : And fix them
2 : Ok and (--) so the two you have for the fire are these two right here
1 : Yeah so I might
2 : Yup (--)
1 : Um so
1 : and then I'll move in towards the center cause being on the corner I don't think is the best idea
2 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : Good alright
2 : Alright
2 : Yup and I need two.
1 : Oh I got a fire one too that's good.
2 : Ah
2 : Alright fire then ok and two flood
2 : Yup
1 : Ok we still got Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.
2 : Temple of the Moon's there, Iron Gate's there.
3 : mm. Here's
3 : Gate
2 : Ok
2 : Alright so it's my turn
2 : Um
1 : Look
1 : you should definitely see a Temple of the Moon just cause it's
2 : Ok yeah I can do that
1 : On the
1 : one's we moved basically
2 : so I'll move shore up and then
1 : then
2 : no one needs any of my cards right now
1 : no I don't think so so I think you're fine staying at the top of the board.
3 : Hmm
2 : And I have four cards. I have four cards which means that when I get the next two that I will have to discard one of these.
1 : Shore up.
2 : So I could just use this.
2 : Ah well there's no is there really any point in using it because.
3 : Oh.
1 : No not really.
3 : I would wait till like it
3 : use that for once it get around here.
1 : yeah I would save that for whenever we get into a dire situation. I'd rather get rid of an idol than get rid of Sandbag card.
2 : Sure.
2 : Ok
3 : Cause right now we can get wherever really (--)
2 : Well I would so this is what I'm thinking. Is it cool if I
2 : I would move here, shore up and then move
2 : back just because I'd still have like a good
1 : yeah that's good with me
3 : yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Ok I'll do that
1 : Alright cool
2 : Move back, I'll get two treasures which (--) discard once the water's rise.
2 : So we have to move that one up
2 : Um
1 : Now you gotta draw three of them after you shuffle them back in
2 : Ok so, keep in mind that we have Temple of Moon and Iron Gate so we also have to keep in mind which ones we have for floods
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : Alright.
2 : Then.
2 : Pick three
2 : Alright so we have Temple of the Moon again.
2 : Ah Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Ah where's that the middle so its (--) Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Right here.
2 : Ok so those are.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok so it's good that you're near by those.
3 : Alright.
2 : Engineer. Ok.
3 : Um
3 : I'm thinking I'll
3 : Go here.
3 : As one of my actions.
3 : I can give a
3 : No I can't give a card. Yeah I could give him a card and then since this is adjacent I could shore it up.
1 : Yeah you can give a card, I would just have to discard one.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : So
3 : Here
3 : Give me this one.
1 : I'll discard this one since you have the (--) already (--).
2 : (--)
1 : We can both like try and give you the so discard this one into the dicard pile
2 : Ok
1 : um and then
2 : Ok
3 : and I'm gonna shore this up
1 : Perfect
1 : Ok cool alright, you gotta draw your cards
2 : Ok cool
3 : Yeah
3 : Alright so
3 : I have a treasure and Sandbags.
1 : Nice.
2 : And then Whispering and Lost Lagoon. So Lost Lagoon is officially sunk.
1 : So
2 : So you can put that with the card
3 : Ok.
1 : Take that out
1 : And Whispering Garden
1 : Right here
2 : Flooded yeah.
3 : Ok
3 : I'll put that (--) thanks.
2 : Ok.
1 : Ok um so my turn then?
1 : Um so I guess I will
1 : Um
1 : Shore up this one right, cause I can shore
1 : I can move
1 : and then I can capture the treasure and those could be my three moves right?
3 : mm
2 : Shore, move and then
3 : Um wait
2 : so the current the
3 : You can't go
3 : Oh yeah you can't go diagonal cause you're an Engineer right?
1 : No no no but I can I can't
1 : Move diagonal
2 : And shore
1 : Or
3 : Oh you're not even moving there anyway. Ok I gotcha
1 : Yeah yeah.
2 : The concern I have then is
2 : Um so there's a possibility that
2 : um is there a possibility that
2 : you might draw a flood that would be Whispering Garden?
1 : No Whis-unless we draw a Water's Rise, we're not gonna draw Whispering Garden.
2 : Ok and then that's a risk in itself. So I mean
1 : I think that's a risk we take
3 : Could you
1 : but also
3 : mm
1 : Um
2 : (--) the Cave of Embers, so it's you can move, shore up both
3 : I could
1 : mm.
2 : move back and then you can
3 : hmm
1 : We also have two Sandbag cards. So if we have to play one we can play one on Whispering Garden.
1 : um
2 : There are two Sandbags. We also have two Helicopter which we could save one in case for Fool's Landing.
2 : But technically it's like
1 : Something we could do is she could play
2 : She
2 : Helicopter move you where ever so you could
1 : So like I could move here, get both of these, she could Helicopter Lift me to there
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And then I could capture the treasure.
1 : Right?
2 : Yeah
3 : Mm yeah.
2 : Is, it's yeah you can play at any time right? With the Helicopter?
1 : Yeah you definitely could play the Helicopter at any time.
2 : Ok.
3 : It doesn't have to be my turn.
2 : Ok yeah so we can do that and we can capture as your third.
1 : Ok.
1 : So I'll move here.
2 : Yup
1 : Alright that's one turn right?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Flip both of these.
1 : You'll Helicopter lift me here right? Discard that.
2 : and so we use that again?
1 : And discard these four to capture the fire.
2 : Nice ok.
1 : Rock on.
2 : Cool.
2 : Alright.
1 : Alright nice. So then I get two of these.
2 : There you go.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Ok.
1 : Definitely give one of those to you on my turn.
2 : One, two floods.
1 : Yup
1 : What do we got here?
3 : ok Iron Gate is officially sunk.
2 : Howling Garden.
2 : Ok.
3 : The card for Iron Gate.
2 : Ok so this is the only one that's Flooded. Oh that and Temple of the Moon ok.
2 : Alright so now it's my turn um.
2 : Mm. ok I don't th-
1 : I think
2 : there's no point in me giving you guys any cards right now.
1 : Yeah I think you should get close to me and
1 : her
1 : me and the Pilot.
2 : You and the Pilot? Ok.
1 : Yeah so we can give you a card basically
1 : Cause we both have the one you need
1 : And then also
2 : And there's the Temple of
1 : We'll be close enough to each other where we can both try and give her our card of the air.
2 : Ok.
1 : Um, so I think you moving here
1 : And then
1 : Shoring up and then we move down one.
2 : The question is do we, do we really is there do we really need to shore that one up if we're if we could focus on this one?
1 : It's true we could get rid of it
2 : Cause we have this one, we
1 : And then
2 : These two
1 : That's true. Then you could maximize the number of moves you could take.
2 : And ah, I could use a Sandbag.
2 : Um Howling Garden instead.
2 : And if we focus on getting the statue here instead of that one.
1 : Yeah and then we can get rid of all these three together cause we don't even need them.
2 : Yeah and then I, I need to use a Sandbag cause I already have five so then that would
3 : Wait could I fly for my turn could I fly anywhere?
1 : You get to fly anywhere, yeah so you could fly there.
3 : Is one action like
3 : But can I do it like
3 : As two actions?
1 : What do you mean?
3 : So like if
3 : You were to
2 : Oh
3 : Get closer here
3 : maybe I could fly up
1 : That's true.
3 : shore this and fly back.
1 : That's true if you moved three as your turn
2 : Ok
1 : She could then move
3 : Just so we're keeping
1 : Shore
1 : Move
3 : the ones like this so we don't
3 : just in case
1 : Well wait actually
2 : Ok
1 : No I'm not sure we could do that cause if you move three to get on to the same one as her
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : She has to take one turn by giving you a card, so then she can only do two things
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : Yeah so she can't shore and then move back.
1 : Although you could just, you could just move then shore and then you don't need to move back because you already gave the card
2 : And then just stay there
3 : Or what's this Sandbag?
2 : Sandbag is just to shore up any ca-any tile any time.
3 : So
2 : So I mean
3 : I don't even need to move for this then
2 : Yeah I have a Sandbag as well so I could um
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Just Sandbag that
2 : I can move three
2 : And then when it's your turn you can
2 : trade with me
2 : Oh
3 : And also Sandbag that one.
1 : Yeah
2 : And also Sandbag it if you really want to yeah. Yeah we could do that. So you want me to do that? All three moves as a turn (--) all three turns?
1 : We
1 : yeah
1 : Yeah I think that's the best yeah.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok so I'll do that.
2 : One, two
1 : Alright two
2 : three and then I'll Sandbag.
2 : Is it ok if I sandbag Howling Garden?
1 : Yeah I think that's smart.
2 : Ok
2 : Do that, Sandbag, ok.
1 : And pick up two cards
2 : Two cards and of a flood.
1 : And then you gotta get rid of one also, or do you now? I guess you don't cause the Flood is discarded.
3 : Mm.
2 : No.
2 : So this has a Water's Rise
1 : (--)I'll move that up, and then you pick up shuffle.
2 : Ah that's three.
2 : two
2 : three
2 : so Bridge, Whispering Garden and Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Yeah sorry, yeah Breaker's Bridge sorry. Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : And what was the third one?
3 : Nice
2 : Yeah right there so
1 : Very cool
2 : (--) ok.
1 : Alright cool so I think it's
3 : Alright so first thing you (--) is give you this
2 : Ok so that's one action. And I have to -yeah I can discard this since we already have it.
3 : No wait.
1 : Yeah
3 : I can't
3 : Yeah I can cause we're on the same one
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so I'll discard that and give her that
3 : Um ok
1 : (--)
2 : So three
3 : Um
1 : Then you can fly
3 : I could
3 : shore this
3 : I could do these
1 : Yeah I think you should
1 : I think you should shore up one of the closer ones cause I don't think we're gonna need this because once it's my turn I can give it to him
3 : Yeah
3 : You can just go right there yeah.
1 : And then he can just grab this one real quick so we don't even need this one really if it comes down to it
3 : But just because this one's in the middle maybe you should do that one.
2 : I would shore this one. Ah we the next Flood cards out of the Flood cards are coming, I know this is one of them. Um
2 : I mean Whispering Garden's if we'd lose that that's not a big deal cause there's nothing we need reach with it and then we could just focus on getting it from here.
1 : Yeah true.
2 : So, I would, I would shore up Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok I think Cliffs of Abandon's a smart choice.
3 : Ok.
2 : Ok so that's
1 : And then I'd
2 : Two actions take one more action
1 : Stay where you are
1 : I don't know what do you think? Last action. I guess you could shore up one more just because.
3 : Ah
3 : That's this
3 : Might as well
1 : Might as well
2 : Might as well? Ok.
1 : Yeah alright cool.
2 : Alright and two
2 : treasures for you
3 : Oh thanks.
3 : K.
1 : What'd you get?
2 : So you got two of them? Ok.
3 : Yeah and then another Helicopter.
2 : Then
2 : You had TEmple of the Moon, so that one's sunk.
2 : Top one.
3 : Ok so (--)
2 : And then Howling Garden's is flooded.
1 : Ok so
1 : Alright and then (--) could do that.
1 : Definitely
1 : Um
1 : Move
1 : and give each of you my cards
1 : As my turn
1 : Because then she'll have three and you'll have the fourth one for
1 : ah the statue.
2 : So that would be all of your three turns.
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh I see ok.
1 : And then I, I think that's the best way cause I don't, I couldn't
3 : So move one, two cards
1 : Unless you Helicopter Lifted me somewhere I wouldn't be able to
1 : Save either of these and I think the getting you the cards is more important right now especially since we're already running lower on time. We're probably at least half way through already.
2 : Ok.
2 : Ok alright so you'll know
1 : (--) move here and then I'll give you one card.
2 : Ok.
2 : Ok.
1 : I'll give you one card.
3 : Ok.
2 : And I have to discard one of these so.
1 : Yeah I think you're getting rid of that. Yeah so that way you can give her.
2 : This one?
3 : I need the Lion and I could
2 : Ok yeah sure, ok.
1 : That, although wait.
2 : Like what (--) both of those?
3 : Oh wait, I need to discard one.
1 : I think you discard one of the Helicopter ones.
2 : Yeah.
3 : (--)
2 : Ok
1 : Oh wait
1 : Yeah ok yeah sorry.
3 : Cause I've
3 : I should probably ok
1 : Ok.
1 : So then now I pick up two cards
3 : (--)
2 : Right. Yeah.
1 : Wow that was really convenient.
2 : Alright so we have Crimson Forest and Copper Gate.
1 : Ah
1 : Um
3 : Lose Copper Gate
3 : And Crimson Forest
1 : Alright cool
1 : Alright, I think
2 : Right
1 : Now I think you should, I realize you can't give that to her and get down here.
2 : Oh sorry three, sorry three. So Cave of Embers as well. So that's flooded.
3 : Oh
2 : My bad
1 : No problem
1 : Alright so that one doesn't even matter cause it's fire and we already got that so
1 : Alright for your turn, I realize that you can't give her that card.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And move two and capture. So I think you should worry about capturing.
2 : You want me to capture? Ok.
1 : Over
1 : getting and then what she could
1 : yeah
3 : yeah I would capture
1 : And then she could Helicopter Lift you there
1 : And then doesn't worry about moving.
2 : We, we don't know how certain we are to get a Helicopter Lift again which we need to get off the island. So I, I think it's
3 : really?
2 : really important to have always one.
2 : Helicopter Lift between us three.
1 : I think that's probably true. I think that's a safe play.
2 : cause
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah that's a safer it's riskier,it's less risky. I think I could
2 : So I think could, I think you should use a Sandbag to save either Howling Garden or Whispering Garden because
1 : Yeah we definitely need to save one
3 : Yeah
2 : Um, I think you should use one of yours right now to save either one. I, I think this one is probably best cause it's closer to where we'll be at exit.
1 : Yeah I think that's right.
3 : Ok.
2 : Um
3 : (--) that right now.
2 : Ok.
1 : Alright cool.
2 : Do that, I will so you guys just move and capture. Ok. I'll do that.
3 : I think you should
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah I think that's the smartest choice.
2 : Alright.
2 : So two and then
2 : use (--)
2 : these to capture
2 : ok, awesome and then I'll get
1 : nice
1 : Alright cool and then draw
1 : two cards
2 : two (--) have a chalice and
2 : iron and then three
2 : floods
2 : So I have Coral Palace
2 : Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate.
1 : Coral Palace
3 : Ok
1 : Who's
2 : So Coral Palace is wait ah
3 : Oh
2 : What you guys are on right now ok.
2 : So that one Dunes of Deception's right here.
2 : And Silver Gate' right here.
1 : Yeah
2 : There you go. Ok so it's your turn now.
1 : Ok gotcha.
3 : Alright
3 : Um
3 : So
3 : Everyone
1 : It think you, I think staying where you are
1 : would be
3 : Oh we still have this one, ok.
1 : would be prudent because
1 : Ah
3 : Do I want to get to him so I can get them
3 : card
1 : Hmm
1 : Actually you know what we could do? Oh wait, you could fly, you could move yourself to him
2 : Yeah I would shore up
1 : Which would be one turn and you could give him two of your cards
1 : because his turn comes up sooner.
1 : Right?
1 : and then you have all four rather than
1 : like us giving one to you. I don't know if that would work.
2 : So if you're giving me all four which means I would have to take
2 : three turns to see if you can get there so the next turn we're not guaranteed to get a statue.
1 : That's also true.
2 : Um
3 : So I could just fly to this statue.
1 : Yeah that is true. That's true. That's smart.
2 : Yeah cause it's
2 : It's most convenient.
2 : Ok alright so I would say one is to shore up that.
1 : Ok.
1 : Yeah, yeah definitely.
2 : That you're on Coral Palace
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : (--) for sure.
2 : Ah you don't have to do two more actions but ah
2 : So I mean
3 : Ah let's see
2 : Would you like to do anything else? Would like to move anywhere? Is there any reason for you to move anywhere?
3 : Um
3 : Might as well just
3 : Ah yeah
2 : Do you see any reason to do anything else you don't have to?
1 : Well you could
3 : I was gonna say I could move here and shore up
3 : another statue thingy just in case but we already ahve this.
1 : Hmm, no I think you should move one down.
3 : to get loser to him?
1 : Or you could
2 : You could fly anywhere to and you don't
1 : Yeah, yeah you know what I mean
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah if you're closer to him that's smarter
1 : Cause then it
1 : Doesn't take effort. He doesn't have to waste a move by
3 : then why don't I just do that cause
2 : Ok so just move one ok
1 : cause (I) could fly anywhere yeah.
2 : Alright and then two treasures and then three
3 : Alright
2 : Floods
1 : You'll have to discard one so just get rid of the fire.
3 : Three, four, five.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Alright so you got Bronze Gate's. Tidal Palace which is there.
1 : What do we get?
3 : Oh.
2 : And then was it Temple of the Sun?
3 : (--)
2 : Is right here.
2 : Never mind.
3 : Hmm.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Hmm
2 : K
1 : Alright so it's my turn. I basically just need these and you have one.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : So
1 : I think what I can do is
3 : I have one two
1 : You also have one yeah true.
2 : Keep in mind that you don't have to be on the tile that I'm on for me to give you it, cause I'm the Messenger.
1 : Yeah um
2 : So
1 : Ok I think I should
2 : I think
1 : I can shore up two by moving here and get
2 : (--)
1 : both of these and that way Whispering Garden
2 : So what I'm thinking I totally forgot because of my special ability , I'm able during my turn to give you guys cards not matter where you're at so
1 : Oh wow
2 : if you wanted
3 : so you could just give me that. Ok.
2 : So if you were to just move to that one you were to just move to
2 : Guess where you're at.
3 : Oh
2 : Right.
3 : So if you did just want to go here real quick
1 : Yeah true
1 : get these two move back
3 : Get then just in case and then
2 : Yup and then move back if you wanted to.
1 : Ok yeah let's do that so one turn.
1 : Get both of these.
1 : And move back. That's the end of my turn. I draw two cards.
2 : ok that's it
2 : Ok
1 : Ok Helicopter Lift and Water's rise. Water's rise we're still only collecting three luckily.
2 : Ok I'll shuffle these and then
1 : We're probably gonna lose.
1 : Well
1 : yeah we're probably gonna lose at least one.
2 : That's fine we dont' we don't care if we lose any really. Ok so three of them. One, two
1 : Yeah a lot of them in the corner we don't really need.
1 : Let's see what we got here. Ok Crimson Forest
2 : Three.
2 : Crimson Forest
1 : Ah
1 : Top one, done.
3 : Hmm.
1 : Ah Coral Palace.
2 : Three you're up.
1 : Um yup
2 : I know.
2 : Since it's flooded.
3 : Whoops.
1 : Ok.
1 : And then Dunes of Deception also flooded.
2 : Ok.
1 : Alright cool.
2 : Alright so now it's my turn so I'll use my special ability twice.
2 : Um
2 : And I'll give
2 : you one
2 : I'll give you one. You have to discard one of yours so.
3 : This one.
2 : Ok.
2 : Alright so that's my two abilities and then.
2 : I will start moving to Fool's Landing.
2 : I'll just move.
2 : to here cause that's my third one.
3 : I don't know if we even have to be on Fool's Landing
3 : when we leave as long as
2 : we do
1 : Yeah we do
2 : We must I mean so (--) we all get on and then you use the Helicopter Lift to get us off, so I'll move.
3 : Oh I thought as long as we have the Helicopter.
3 : Ok.
1 : Yeah I have one too now.
2 : Ok and then I'll take two treasure.
2 : Ok.
2 : (--) and then three
2 : floods
2 : so Tidal Palace
2 : So that one's
2 : sunk
2 : Ah Bronze gate that one's sunk as well
3 : Hmm
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Um ok I think you should definitely shore the one up that I'm on.
3 : Ok
3 : Oh first it yeah.
1 : So we can't use that. And then and then capture.
2 : You can fly.
3 : And um
2 : fly and capture that third one.
1 : Oh alright.
1 : two cards.
3 : And then
2 : Two cards, that's it.
3 : for my third ac well I guess I already, ok
1 : No that was all three yeah.
2 : That was all three actions they did
1 : I already get three of these.
3 : So
1 : Alright so Temple of the Sun
2 : Right here (--) sunk ok.
3 : Two
1 : done
1 : Ah Copper Gate sunk.
1 : And the Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Right here. That's flooded. Ok.
3 : Ok.
1 : Ok cool. SO it's my turn now.
2 : So you can one action there.
1 : (--) do one action,
1 : Um get rid of that.
1 : And then what I think we should do is I should move here.
1 : Right?
1 : As my second action and then I can Helicopter Lift you to where we are.
2 : Ok
2 : Ok.
3 : Ok.
1 : And then
1 : Um
2 : There's no reason, (--) do anythign and then you need cards right?
1 : Yeah thanks. Draw two cards.
2 : You draw three.
2 : Yup that's four.
1 : (--) so we got Breaker's Bridge.
2 : One, two, three.
1 : Cave of Embers.
2 : Here, is that sunk?
1 : And Whispering Garden.
2 : Ok. Alright cool.
2 : So that was mine. I won't do anything. I don't see any reason to do anything. So.
3 : Ok.
1 : Yeah so we just gotta pick up two.
2 : Just take two.
2 : Alright, Water's rise.
2 : So, (--) to four.
1 : Now you gotta do four cards.
2 : No shuffle do four.
2 : So far we haven't had Fool's Landing yet.
1 : It's actually really good yeah, because now we cannot even pick up anything. (--) take it.
2 : Alright.
2 : That's sunk.
2 : Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Sunk.
2 : Sunk, Whispering Gardens. Sunk.
3 : mm.
1 : Whispering Garden.
2 : And Cliffs of Abando, sunk.
2 : Ok.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Ok so now you can fly
3 : Alright.
1 : to us cause that's your abil-
2 : and then use your Helicopter and then we're off.
3 : Use this
2 : That's it.
3 : K.

1 : Hmm
3 : Ok
1 : So I move first
2 : Go ahead Engineer
1 : Wait (--) ok.
2 : You take action?
1 : Do
3 : Ah first I think you
1 : Don't we have to grab?
1 : take up to three ok so
2 : So you just, you can move or unsink things
1 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : Move and then
1 : On my second action, I'm gonna
1 : Unsink I guess both of these adjacent ones.
2 : Ooo
2 : Great idea.
1 : And then
1 : Um
1 : Give a treasure card (--)
2 : And
1 : I guess I'll just move again

3 : I just did, I only did one Helicopter Lift ()
2 : You did two?
2 : Oh
2 : Oh you did use that ok.
3 : S

2 : Ta
3 : That's a good idea
2 : Ah
2 : I would say so
1 : Ok
1 : (--)
2 : I think we should just try to shore up all of the ones closest to Fool's landing
2 : Two
3 : Yeah and make sure that Fool's Landing doesn't get flooded because then we'll loose
1 : That's fair
2 : Right.
2 : Ok
3 : Oh sunk
2 : um
2 : So now
1 : So
1 : Should I
2 : That was an action
1 : Yeah so should I move up and shore those two as well?
2 : Was that two actions?
1 : That was one action, cause I can move two
2 : Oh right ok
1 : So Engineer so if I
3 : You get three actions already
2 : So yeah move to Whispering Gardens
1 : So I can move one and then move the next two and then that would be all three
3 : shore up those adjacent yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : can you like shore up
3 : One's diagonally? no because that's the
1 : No only the ones next to, yeah
2 : No that's the
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : So yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : So I should move? Ok cool.
3 : And then
2 : Ok
1 : Alright and then
2 : Hmm

3 : right now you have two fires and I have one fire
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : And I could fly to any tile you're on to give you
3 : A fire

3 : To go to that tile
1 : Or should I just start moving there?
3 : Yeah
1 : Like if I don't have any other actions to take, I can just move towards one
3 : That works too
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah

3 : Have one of the treasure cards sink
2 : Before we get it
3 : I mean it's ok we have one of the treasure cards (--) but we can't have both of them here

2 : Well I don't think you need to um
3 : What if you
2 : Shore up anything because if that's the only one, yeah
1 : Yeah cause if we lose that it doesn't really matter.
2 : So
3 : Ok.
2 : I would say just move there. Yeah
1 : Good
3 : If you take, cause how many actions is that? Is that two or three?
2 : three
1 : That would be one, two, three but I don't, I don't have anything else to do I guess

3 : then
2 : Um
2 : So you can
2 : Shore that up
3 : Mmhmm.

3 : Ok
2 : Um or you
1 : Did you want to
2 : You could yeah you could shore that up and that'll be one and then you can move to, to Cave of Shadows right there.
1 : You could shore it up and then
1 : Or you can just like fly
3 : I can fly to you
3 : And then give you the card
1 : And then give it and then that would be the third action
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, ok
1 : Ok so do you want me to flip it for you.
3 : So yeah flip that
3 : And then I'll fly to
2 : Cave of Shadows
3 : The Cave of Shadows and I'll give you the action card and then we can capture the treasure
1 : Alright and then I have to discard one?

2 : Yeah yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : Yup I don't, that one sorry.
2 : Ok
2 : So
1 : So
2 : Now you have to do three Water's Rise
1 : Alright
1 : Oh he needs to do the Treasure Cards first
2 : Oh ok
3 : Sandbags
3 : And then
3 : The purple thing
1 : Ok huh
2 : Ok
2 : Ha
2 : Um
3 : Cause
1 : And then
3 : Sandbag's can be used at any time
3 : So should I just
3 : Shore up something first?
1 : I mean
1 : Do we need to shore up anything? Yeah
3 : Or, I mean we don't really need those two
2 : Yeah
1 : I mean it
1 : Wouldn't be good to lose is but
3 : There's weight yeah
1 : We're not gonna lose that one immediately either since that card is right here.
1 : I think
1 : And those are all the ones we already tried so
2 : Ok yeah
1 : Ok draw three of these?
2 : Yeah
1 : Do you want to hold or should i just?
3 : Yeah
3 : Sure
3 : Iron Gate, Temple of the Moon
3 : And Cities of Abandon
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : Iron Gate is gone
2 : So put the card in there too
3 : And then
1 : That was another one
3 : Cities of Abandon
1 : Oh this one
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Cliffs of Abandon?
3 : Yeah
1 : I think is there another one? Ok
2 : Ok you're fine
3 : Sorry
1 : No it's fine. It looked like cities from here too actually.
3 : Ok
3 : So then
2 : Hmm
1 : That was like the (--) picture of a city.
2 : Those go here.
3 : That goes here.
2 : Ok that's you then
1 : Ok
1 : So I should
2 : Yeah
1 : Trade these in for a treasure
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : So you just put these in the discard pile right?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Do I take this one?
2 : Two
1 : Yup
2 : Ah, I was (--) so
3 : I think that's how we get it
1 : Move the figurine in front of you, yeah.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Right so now we should
1 : That was one action right?
2 : Try to do this
3 : Yeah that was one action
1 : Should I go
1 : Actually I can't get all the way over there
3 : Wait if you have two, I have one
2 : Yeah
2 : You could um
1 : Should I just
2 : Shore up
1 : Go here and shore up these two.
2 : Yeah, yeah do that.
1 : Cause I can't reach there to shore up that one.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah let's do that
2 : Mm.
1 : Alright do I need to do another action or should I just
2 : I think that was two more
2 : cause you moved
1 : Oh yeah you're right, you're totally right yeah.
2 : And then
2 : Ok
1 : Awesome
2 : Um and then you get two treasure cards
1 : Thank you
3 : Do you have a purple one? Yes.
1 : Yes.
2 : Alright, awesome, awesome.
1 : So we have to get these two.
2 : And then three
2 : 
2 : Wait
2 : Should we use Sandbags to shore up Temple of the Moon before she
2 : It's right there. Never mind.
1 : You keep the (--)
2 : Um well not right now, I don't think there's two
1 : Ah
1 : (--) there.
1 : Yeah right
2 : Both of them in that. Yeah.
1 : Ok
1 : So should I pull these three?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah you're right.
2 : ha
1 : Howling Garden.
1 : Crimson Forest and Copper Gate.
2 : Howling Garden.
3 : Copper
1 : Hmm Crimson Forest
2 : Ok so we definitely need to shore this up
2 : And that
3 : Um
3 : Yeah
2 : Um it's my turn
2 : So
2 : I'll
2 : m
2 : move
1 : Wait hold on a second. Should we, we have four of these now. Should we try and get these two?
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so I'm gonna move there and shore it up and then you guys can meet me there.
3 : Do we wait
1 : What would be the fastest way to do this?
3 : Do we all have to be on the same tile though?
2 : Um I have
3 : If we, wait if well i fyou give a treasure you have to be on the same tile correct?
1 : to give but unless you have
2 : I don't have to be
1 : She doesn't have to be
3 : You don't have to be?
2 : Ah
1 : But can you give more than two because would it make more sense to try and like um
1 : You give it to him and I move to him and then he goes there or something
3 : and then I
3 : and then I fly or I have to fly? yeah.
1 : Or like he flies like he moves and gives it me and then I try to go there.
2 : Ok so
1 : Or can you only move one card?
2 : Give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card, so it would be two actions
3 : Oh yeah
1 : But then so you could do that
2 : I'll shore up Temple of the Moon
1 : Yeah
2 : And then I'll give you
3 : What?
3 : Wait what if you give them
3 : where's I'm here
1 : give them to me I think
3 : Give them to you and then I'll fly and give
1 : He'll give it me and then I can go there. I'll go one, two and do it.
3 : yeah
3 : Yeah it's easier to give them to her
1 : That would be my third action
2 : Ok
1 : I think that makes sense
2 : We also need to shore up Howling Garden though
3 : That's the Engineer
1 : But we have this
2 : Yeah
3 : I have a Sandbag card
1 : Worst comes to worse
2 : Ok, ok, ok so
1 : Yeah well we'll be fine I think
2 : You can have those so that's three of my actions
1 : That's three oh yeah
3 : Ok
2 : And you have five cards so I'll pull
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : Two treasure cards, Water's Rise
1 : Not (--)
2 : Ok
2 : Um sooo
1 : Shall I look it up for you?
2 : Should we Sandbags?
3 : Oh yeah we can do it now.
3 : Alright
2 : Yeah do you want to use
3 : Ok
1 : Or should we save Sandbags in case we like really need it
2 : Yours?
3 : I think we should at least Sandbag Howling Garden so I'm gonna Sandbag Howling Garden.
2 : I think we should sandbag Howling Gardens
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : Um so now I pick three
2 : Cliffs of Abandon, Temple of the Moon
2 : Cirmson Forest
1 : Oh we lost this one.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : So that was it
2 : for me so now it's your turn
1 : Yeah
1 : So it's his turn so he's moving to give the
3 : Ok
1 : Or I don't know what is it? Earth Stone of something like that?
3 : Hmm, yeah the purple one.
1 : The purple one
3 : Ok
3 : So
1 : Do you want to move?
3 : Where am I (--) have to move
1 : Do mine, to give it to me.
3 : To yours to give it to you and then
2 : Yeah
1 : And then I'll take my turn and move one, two and then the third action will be getting the treasure
3 : Ok
3 : Yeah
3 : Good plan
2 : Um ok but
1 : then I which one should I
1 : get rid of here?
3 : I have to do oh
1 : Should I get rid of this one since I already have
3 : Ah
3 : Yeah because then we have two lion
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : And then ok so that was
2 : Two moves
1 : Yeah
3 : Uh huh
2 : So maybe
3 : Oh I hadn't thought this over
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : So three
1 : Alright and then the Treasure cards here.
3 : And now draw two
2 : Now treasure cards

2 : We sandbag
1 : Oh very true, very true
2 : Whispering Garden

1 : Fool's Landing goes down
2 : Ok, ok yeah
3 : True, ok yeah and then also
1 : You know what I mean?
1 : Like we don't also need this one right?
2 : We don't need it anymore

1 : The this one? Yeah
2 : These two, ok. So just pull them.
1 : Ok
3 : And out
3 : Ok yeah
1 : Alright that's um
1 : Silver Gate, Cave of Embers and Howling Garden.
1 : So yeah sorry I know that was my fault.
3 : Oh sorry.
2 : Silver Gate
2 : Alright so now we definitely have to shore up
1 : one of those
2 : Howling Garden or Whispering Gate
1 : Um
2 : Um
2 : It's my turn right?
1 : Yeah you can move and
2 : Yeah so I'll

2 : I will
1 : Where who are we trying to get these two first of all?
3 : They're the Lions? Um

2 : Yeah no one, I'm closest to here.
1 : I can

3 : Do we have, so we don't have to be on the same tile?
2 : No, I don't
1 : No and she doesn't have to be
3 : Oh you don't ok cause you've got your special power
2 : I think that's why it's called the Messenger yeah. Alright, now I'll pull these two.

1 : So he's gonna need to get
3 : Why
1 : One of these
3 : I'm gonna have to get your card
3 : And then get to
3 : Whispering Garden
3 : BY using a Helicopter Lift
1 : You can
1 : Cause I can only give it to you once it's my turn
1 : So we're gonna have to wait another turn for you to
3 : Ohh
3 : Ok
2 : So you should shore up
1 : And than ah
3 : Ok so that's one
2 : Um
1 : I guess you could just
1 : You can move to Whispering Garden
2 : And then
1 : Or no fly me to Whispering Garden
1 : That was one, two three
1 : You can move to Whispering Garden and then use one of your Helicopter Lift cards to move me to Whispering Garden
3 : mm.
2 : Yeah
1 : Or you can we can just wait until your turn and you could give him your card too, we don't have to move, maybe we can just save the Helicopter Lift
1 : I wouldn't want to leave
3 : I have two Helicopter Lifts too so
1 : But like she can just give it to you as part of your turn she dones't have to be next to you
2 : Cause we have to wait anyways
1 : Cause we have to wait around anyways for you to use it.
3 : Ok yeah so let's do that
2 : So
1 : So just go to like
1 : Whispering Garden I guess
2 : Um ok wait
2 : So you have
1 : That's the three
2 : Was that one or two turns? Cause you can fly anywhere on the board
3 : That was, that would have been two
2 : So that was two
1 : Yup
2 : So now
3 : And then I get flip
2 : flip one of them
3 : One of them doesn't matter which one I f
1 : I would
1 : flip
2 : I would do Breaker's Bridge cause it looks like more of a um
1 : Yeah
3 : Whichever one's like connected to things
1 : Central one
2 : Yeah
2 : Right so that was three, so now pull two treasure cards
2 : But you have to discard one
3 : Ok so
1 : But two of them (--) he cause he already has five
3 : Three four five six
2 : yeah so maybe just a
3 : Good
1 : just discard both of those yeah you don't need them

2 : Oh he just went
1 : sh
2 : Ok
1 : We're gonna have to ok when we give him the other discard
1 : He's gonna have to use, like we're goinna have to lose a Helicopter Lift anyways
1 : Should we just
2 : Why are we gonna use a Helicopter Lift?
1 : Cause he has to just discard it
1 : To accept the card from you
1 : (--) guard
2 : Oh hey you're right
3 : Oh
1 : So like is it useful if like we use one now?
3 : Sh I said
3 : You can
2 : yeah just do it cause you're gonna have to do it anyways
3 : Yeah
1 : I mean but like where
3 : And then I can play at any time
1 : But I mean
2 : Yeah so just
1 : Or should
2 : First you should shore this up
1 : or should I just
2 : I mean
1 : Move to Fools' landing and wait
2 : we don't need it anymore acutally
1 : I don't know if it's
2 : Just fly her there
2 : And she can give you the card
3 : So shore her
3 : Do you want to shore that up and then I'll fly you here?
2 : Well we don't need it anymore
3 : Need what? the Temple of the Sun?
2 : Or Moon because we have that
1 : Yeah should I just wait at Fool like if I go to Fool's Landing on your turn you can just give this to him as part of your action?
1 : and then move to Fool's Landing and then he can ah
1 : put the things down
1 : And then he can fly to Fool's Landing. Yeah.
2 : Move to Fool's Landing
3 : and then I can fly
3 : (--) and then we can get out.
2 : Ok yeah so just
3 : Alright, let's do that.
1 : So I was moving to Fool's Landing. Ok.
2 : One two three go to Fool's Landing.
1 : And then I guess if
3 : Ok
3 : So
1 : If anything starts sinking we'll figure that out.
3 : was
3 : so then I use the Helicopter card for that?
1 : No um I just use my three actions to move there.
3 : Right alright
3 : ok cause that's the moves
1 : It think
1 : Yeah um and then
3 : Ok

3 : Yeah let's do that
1 : Fly to Fool's Landing and leave
1 : So do I use that now and you'll go and we'll wait for him at Fool's Landing?
2 : Ok
1 : So you can discard that
2 : Ok so now I pick two of these
1 : Wait oh
2 : And two and I'll just
3 : yeah
3 : Yup
2 : Discard this
2 : And then pull three
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : (--) Breaker's Bridge
2 : Howling Garden
2 : And Silver Gate
3 : Ok
2 : Discard the water
1 : Oh that was supposed to be over there.
2 : (--) card
2 : Oh
2 : Whoops
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Yes
3 : Ok so first
1 : So first
2 : Turn those in put them here
3 : Turn that in there
2 : And that's yours
3 : And then Helicopter Lift
2 : Well you don't have to, you can just fly
3 : And either way I can fly myself
1 : You can just fly
3 : Well first thing is fly myself here and then Helicopter us out
1 : Then
2 : So
1 : And then is that it?
2 : So we're done?
3 : I think so
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
1 : Do we have to do anything else?
3 : Yeah it says lift your team off Fool's Landing for the win
3 : So we won.

4 : Ok
1 : Well I can, I can shore up two adjacents, I don't think I can do it diagonally though
4 : No
1 : Or can I?
4 : So you can get all four of that- All four of those I guess
1 : Um
4 : If you shore up and then you move to Temples of the Moon
4 : and then hit this
4 : Breaker's and Bridg-
4 : Like do these two, move here and do these two.
1 : And then
1 : Can- I can't do a diagonal though to shore it up.
4 : No, no, but
3 : So you'd move
4 : So go- Do these first
1 : Just flip em
4 : Yeah
1 : and then move.
4 : And then move over to the Temple of the Moon.
1 : Can I move diagonally?
4 : No, that's just everyone
4 : No you can't.
4 : You could just move to here though
1 : Oh I see what you're saying. Ok
4 : And then you could do it again
4 : cause those are gonna come up as soon as the Water's Rise again.
1 : Um
1 : am I breaking any rule?
4 : I don't think so
3 : I hope not.
1 : So
1 : Oh
3 : So that would be three actions.
3 : Right?
1 : Shore up two tiles for one action and- yeah that's three so I take uh
4 : Yeah
4 : yeah
2 : Um two treasure
4 : two treasure cards.
4 : Yeah (--) wanna use everyone's special actions as much as we can.
1 : Good news, Water Rises
1 : So we're up
1 : we're still with two.
1 : And then um
1 : what do we have to do?
4 : Shuffle
1 : This goes
4 : Yeah
1 : back
1 : there.
4 : Yeah we shuffle those.
4 : And put em back on top
1 : (--)
4 : We shuffle discards and put em back on top
1 : Where'd these come from?
4 : They're the ones that were already
4 : flooded.
1 : Ok and then
4 : draw two.
1 : Ok
1 : So we're flooding these right?
3 : Yeah
2 : Uh huh
4 : Yeah
1 : Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon.
4 : So Golden Gate's gone now?
4 : So I have to discard these
1 : Did they set these up?
3 : Which one is Lost Lagoon?
4 : And then Lost Lagoon
2 : Lost Lagoon is right here.
1 : Where's Lost Lagoon?
3 : It's lost.
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : So that
4 : then that goes back.
3 : Gets discarded over here.
4 : Oh wait no it goes back over there.
3 : Wait
2 : The uh flood pile
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Does that go right back on top?
3 : No it goes over there.
4 : No no
2 : And right here.
4 : No up
4 : face up yeah.
3 : Face up.
2 : Yeah you're good.
3 : Oh where'd the other one go?
1 : Can I do anything else here?
4 : (--) discard it, we lost it.
2 : That was it.
3 : Oh
2 : Um
4 : Yup
4 : Messenger.
1 : Remember we can give each other cards too.
1 : Because we gotta
4 : Yeah but only during your turn.
4 : But
4 : yeah
1 : Right
1 : Cause we eventually have to get these things.
2 : (--)
4 : Yeah
2 : Alright
2 : so I can't get to any tiles this turn
1 : Which color are you?
2 : The gray here
2 : Um
2 : I can give away cards
3 : Is anyone
3 : close to the thing?
1 : Oh you got one of them and one of them
1 : The red ones.
2 : K so I guess I'll move one and then I'll give away two cards for my actions.
4 : Yeah
2 : Um I'll give you this
4 : Ok
2 : And I'll give you this one.
1 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : and then
2 : I will
2 : do something with
2 : There
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : And then I draw two cards
2 : um
4 : Yes
1 : So what's the advantage of having two? You can fly em
1 : Is there something else?
2 : Um
3 : If I use the Helicopter
3 : Lift card I can move them both.
2 : Yeah
3 : But I don't know if we
4 : Yeah but I wanna save that till the end though
3 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
3 : I don't know how many there are of these in the deck, I have no idea.
4 : Yea
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah yeah
2 : So we need at least one of them
4 : Yeah
2 : (--) then
3 : Yeah
2 : K
4 : And that could help us get there fast too (--) if anything's sinking at the end,
4 : before we leave.
3 : Ok wait so now
2 : Ok, now I draw two of these
1 : It seems like it being around the edges is not too smart cause if we, we sink
1 : tiles and strand somebody we're done.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : So
4 : Temples of the Moon
2 : Ok, (--) Cliffs
4 : Hmm ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Alright
3 : So
3 : What can
3 : um
3 : I guess I uh
4 : If you wanna get like one of these two I could get
4 : these two in the middle.
3 : Yeah so I guess I can use my power
3 : to fly here
3 : and then
3 : shore up this guy.
3 : So that's two
3 : and I guess I only,
3 : I only need two actions.
3 : And then I take two of these, right?
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Who can shore up diagonally, is that Explorer?
4 : Yeah I can do that, so I can
3 : K
3 : And then the
1 : You got two Helicopter cards
3 : flood cards.
4 : Nice
3 : So it is
3 : Breaker's Bridge and Phantom Rock.
3 : Here, Phantom Rock would've been sunk so good call.
4 : (--) nice way
3 : Uh and over there
4 : Alright so I'll shore up
4 : diagonally
4 : and move here
4 : and then I'll shore up
4 : uh this one actually just so
4 : if it breaks you can go to the right one.
3 : Yeah, (--)
4 : Uh and then two treasure cards
3 : Got it?
4 : Yeah
4 : thanks.
4 : Alright
4 : K
4 : The only thing is, the only thing is we only have five so we should probably trade some of these away next time.
4 : Um and then two more of these guys.
4 : The Whispering Gardens and Iron Gate.
3 : Iron Gate's here
4 : Uh
4 : k
4 : Here is Whispering Garden
4 : Ok
4 : Cool
4 : (--) back to you Engineer.
1 : Well I'm allowed to shore up two at a time
3 : Mmhmm
2 : You know
1 : but I have to move
1 : If I move here then I can hit
1 : both of them. Does that seem smart?
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
4 : Do you wanna trade anything first though? That's the only other thing
1 : Uh do I- do we have to do that first?
4 : No although
4 : Well you're just gonna lose- If you get two treasure cards you can only carry five so
2 : You have to discard two
1 : But I can choose at the time what to give away right?
4 : To throw away yeah, but we lose them as a group, that's the only thing.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Uh uh discard doesn't mean give away. Oh you're right.
4 : Yeah throw away
1 : Uh which, what should I give here?
4 : Let's see here
1 : We got
1 : three of us have chalices
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
1 : You have five already
1 : maybe I should just give em to you.
3 : We have to be on the same
2 : (--) the same tile- Ok so you have to give it to me then?
4 : Oh
1 : Oh but you go
3 : tile
4 : Yeah you can give it to him
2 : Cause we're on the same
1 : Even to give them we have to be on the same tile?
3 : Unless you're the Messenger.
4 : Yeah he can be like the broker
3 : The Messenger's power is he can give at anytime
1 : Ok
4 : But is it, is it one move- action per card though?
3 : Yeah it's one action per card.
4 : So you're just giving one, just
2 : Ok, so give me
2 : Yeah
4 : Just so that we don't lose one.
1 : Ok that's one,
1 : and then I
1 : go two and then
3 : But wait do you have to move? Can you shore up both of these without moving?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
4 : He can't, he
2 : He can't do it diagonal?
1 : I can't do diagonal right?
4 : yeah no.
3 : Oh
2 : Just adjacent
1 : But if I move there that's um
1 : second action and the third one I can do two of them.
4 : Yeah that'll be, that'll work.
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah it's good
1 : That seem good?
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Alright, we're floating.
3 : Right now.
4 : K, treasure
4 : Don't get a Water's Rise.
2 : (--)
1 : Do I have to pull cards?
3 : Yeah yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : (Cool)
1 : Oh boy
4 : Well
3 : It's gonne be exciting.
1 : Well yeah, now we're up three.
1 : So that goes there
1 : and we're
2 : Um well we have to shuffle these and put them on the top
4 : No we shuffle those.
2 : and then draw.
3 : There's a lot going on in this game.
2 : Yeah
1 : Are we allowed to say how we're shuffling?
4 : No, no, I don't think so.
3 : I guess that's probably the point, is that you can't.
1 : Then say we're not
1 : Is that cheating, whatever you want is up there.
4 : You probably have to shuffle face down.
1 : I don't know if we're doing this- Were we supposed to do em that way
2 : Put em face
3 : You shuffle em and then you put em on top and then you're gonna end up drawing some of those cards again.
4 : You probably shuffle them first, yeah
1 : Alright
1 : two of them right?
2 : Uh three this time.
4 : Three now, yeah.
1 : Oh yeah I should've known that one
1 : Ok, goodbye Lost Lagoon,
1 : Breaker's Bridge,
1 : where I'm
1 : floating.
1 : Lost Lagoon, that's handy.
2 : Ok
1 : Temple of the Moon, didn't we- We're getting the same one.
4 : Temple of the Moon, ok.
2 : Oh
4 : Right cause they, they come back up.
3 : Cause you shuffled em, put em right on top.
1 : And as the water gets higher we're gonna get
1 : deeper and more of them are gonna start to float.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : So we should try and I guess remember
4 : Yeah
3 : the ones that keep coming up
4 : Yeah
3 : cause they're gonna keep coming up.
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok so
3 : And remember to flip em.
4 : face up
4 : (now)
3 : Face up, yeah
1 : Face up?
4 : Yeah
1 : Um
4 : K
1 : I'm done right?
4 : Yup
3 : Yes
2 : Um
4 : (--)
2 : We should probably use
2 : two actions to shore up
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : Um
1 : The thing is if I stay there I can
1 : use it, I can do two at a time.
1 : Maybe you don't,
2 : Yeah
3 : But if one of us tries,
1 : maybe you don't have to waste your time
1 : on that.
3 : if one of us draws a
2 : Um
1 : On the other hand if they sink
3 : Water's Rise.
1 : then am I screwed?
1 : Only if uh
1 : I'd have to be able to get to this one
2 : Yeah
2 : maybe I could
1 : or this one.
2 : Move to your tile again
2 : and get rid of ,
2 : and shore up the one you're standing on
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : That would be
2 : And then if these are still around you can shore up both of these in your turn
1 : Yeah ok
2 : Or maybe I should shore up two, I don't know. We might lose, we might lose one in the mean time.
4 : Yeah might
4 : Might as well, cause you can swim to places from there so it's not the end of the world if we
4 : Cause Temple of the Moon is probably more important since it has this guy in it.
1 : You know what though, if, if
1 : if the outer ones sink they're, they're no matter a threat to us cause they go in the box right?
2 : Yeah that's true
2 : Yeah
2 : ok
1 : just so we don't
2 : That's a good point though, we should definitely focus on these ones with the
2 : with the treasure icons on them,
2 : cause they're the important ones.
3 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : so I'll definitely shore up this one
2 : um
2 : and then I guess I'll
4 : (--)
4 : Doesn't
2 : Well
2 : Does it matter if I move or not?
4 : yeah you could maybe shore up
4 : Yeah maybe shore up Breaker's and give that- a chalice to the Pilot
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
4 : Just so that we
4 : been trying to
4 : I think we were trying to get him one too.
2 : Yeah
1 : So there's two chalices right?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : We can grab
4 : Mmhmm
1 : But all we have to do is capture em
4 : We have to have four of em
3 : Mmhmm
2 : (--)
4 : and be at that spot.
1 : Four cards in just one person
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
4 : Ok, treasure card
3 : Can I ask you a question
3 : about the rules or
3 : No
3 : Ok
4 : What?
3 : So
3 : I
3 : Do you know if it's, if it's someone elses turn can they give me a card if I move to their space?
3 : Or is it only you can give a card on your own turn?
4 : Yeah I don't know
2 : You have to be on your own turn cause it counts as an action
4 : I think you have to give yeah
3 : Oh
4 : Yeah I don't think you can take
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah
4 : Alright
2 : Um so I drew those
4 : Two sandbags
2 : the four
2 : We also, we also have two of these if we decide to use them.
4 : Unless I give you my
4 : um
4 : lion
2 : I have um
2 : two sandbags I can, I can shor eup two tiles at anytime.
4 : Yeah
4 : Nice
2 : Um
1 : how do they work again?
1 : sandbags
2 : Just play it at anytime and it can
2 : shore up any island,
2 : any tile.
2 : Right
4 : Yeah
2 : Um and it doesn't count as an action.
2 : So I don't know when we wanna use these
2 : I know, we gotta, we gotta make sure- We probably wanna use them on this if that comes up
1 : Does that
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Cause we don't want that to sink
4 : Yeah
2 : So maybe I should save them for now cause we haven't really lost much
4 : Did Whispering Garden just get hit or did it
2 : (--)
4 : Like it's already been shuffled back in.
2 : And like that
3 : Was it
3 : I- Was it started that way?
3 : (--)
3 : I don't remember
2 : It's been- I think it, I'm pretty sure it's in the deck.
2 : I don't know are we allowed to look at these, I don't know.
4 : So maybe we wanna
4 : I don't think so
2 : Ok
4 : That's the one
2 : I don't think it was one of the three that recently got
1 : Didn't say we weren't allowed to
4 : That's the one that maybe we wanna save just cause it has the lion thing
2 : Yeah
4 : But um- Cause then I can give you my lions during my turn and you- Cause you are- cause you can only hold five anyways.
2 : That's true um ok
3 : But these don't count towards the five though
4 : Oh they don't?
3 : I thought the special action ones do
4 : Oh you're right, you're right.
3 : I'm not sure.
1 : Yeah I don't think they count.
2 : Oh they don't count towards your five cards?
4 : Oh ok
4 : Oh that's good
3 : I'm not positive.
4 : (--)
4 : Including them, actually.
4 : Yeah
3 : Oh it does include them.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah you can play them at anytime.
1 : They do not count as an action but you can't sandbag something once it's sunk.
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : I'm just wondering what if we get
1 : two Fool's Landing at the same pull and that thing's gone
4 : Well we can't though, we'll have to get a Water's Rise. There's only one for each. But then if we get a Water's Rise in between then we can get Fool's Landing.
1 : Yeah
4 : You know what I mean?
4 : Because like
2 : Right
2 : Yeah
4 : this one is still
4 : it's still, it's like close to the top, we know that
1 : Right
4 : so that's the only thing
4 : but
2 : (--)
1 : Oh I see what you're saying, we know it's not near, there couldn't,
4 : It's up to you
1 : there cannot be two at the top
2 : Right
1 : so far.
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah, only the ones that are flipped have the chance of getting eliminated.
1 : Ok
2 : I'll use my, I'll use one of these sandbags on um
4 : Ok
2 : Whispering Garden.
2 : Ok, then I'll draw my flood cards.
4 : Cool
3 : Uh
3 : these ones first right?
4 : He did, he did this, yeah
3 : Did you already- You already did that?
2 : I already did, I did those, yeah.
2 : I'll take three of these
2 : oh wow.
3 : Good call with that.
2 : So Whispering Garden,
4 : Ok
2 : Iron Gate,
1 : But is it to our advantage just to let these outer ones sink
4 : gone.
1 : and go away?
2 : Oh sorry
4 : But not if they have that, the statues on them, that's what we need.
3 : I don't know.
2 : Um
4 : Like cause we need to be at one of these places.
1 : True, ok
2 : Ok, and the Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Ok it's right there.
1 : Now I guess if the card goes away we do go down deeper (--)
4 : Right, yeah
4 : K
2 : Alright
3 : so
3 : I don't really have many idea about
3 : what to do
2 : Oh you might wanna grab
3 : um
2 : Oh never mind, we can't
2 : Whispering Garden isn't shuffled in yet
3 : But it
1 : You're on chalice
3 : I can move- What if I move here and then
3 : uh shore up both of these two?
1 : Can you
2 : Yeah
1 : You can fly anywhere at once
3 : Mmhmm
1 : I mean you're already in a good spot if we can get you these two cards you could
1 : capture
2 : Yeah
3 : But then next turn I can just fly right back
4 : Yeah
4 : If you end your turn where I am I can give you this
1 : True
4 : Uh chalice
3 : Wait you are
3 : ok
4 : I can end at the Cliffs
4 : or close to there, I mean,
4 : either way.
2 : I don't know it might be
2 : Whether you fly there for one turn
2 : That's one ac- you could get
4 : Yeah or we could fly there and shore up two
2 : You might wanna get
2 : I feel like we should get Whispering Garden again since we already
2 : been trying to save it
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok wait does it
3 : Does shoring up
3 : Shoring up is one action
2 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
3 : so I could fly and shore up two
3 : or
3 : yeah
4 : Yeah that's not bad
3 : and then you could use one of your
3 : turns to move
4 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : so
3 : So I'll do that.
3 : Thanks
3 : Oh
4 : Treasure
3 : Alright, yeah treasure
3 : So we got fire
3 : and
3 : the other one.
4 : Oh shoot
4 : but now we have to
3 : So yeah I have to discard now.
3 : So
3 : what don't we need?
3 : So I'm gonna definitely keep these guys
2 : Mmhmm
3 : I feel like the Helicopters could come in handy later
4 : Yeah definitely.
4 : Um
1 : Yeah after this card
3 : Yeah
4 : Maybe the li- maybe a lion, since
4 : he's got two lions already
3 : Since you guys already have the four
3 : then
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Earth or fire?
3 : I guess maybe the
3 : there is one
3 : then I can
3 : give the fire to you at some point.
4 : Yeah
4 : not a bad idea.
1 : Where's discards go, on the top?
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah we can't get them back though.
4 : They're gone.
4 : Yeah that's fine.
3 : Does seem right.
4 : Yeah
3 : Got it
3 : pick something
3 : and then uh
3 : the flood cards.
3 : K
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Temple of the Sun,
3 : and Phantom Rock.
3 : Crimson Forest is this guy
4 : Phantom Rock's gone.
3 : Uh
4 : Unless she's flipped it
3 : No I don't
2 : No
4 : Ok
3 : So there you go,
3 : these guys (good)
3 : Oh
4 : Ok
4 : alright so
4 : Actually now that I'm thinking about it maybe I'll just give you both of these
4 : so you can complete the
4 : um
2 : Ok.
4 : lion (--)
4 : One, two, three, shoot.
2 : Or I could
2 : hmm
2 : never mind.
2 : Maybe we should- I could just come to you.
3 : Yeah I could play this at anytime, I could move one of you
3 : where you need to go.
2 : Hmm
4 : That's true
2 : I don't know if we need
2 : need that yet. I don't know how important that is.
4 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : I'm still three spots away from a
4 : Yeah
2 : lion.
4 : Hmm
2 : I could try to get to you at some point later.
2 : No, I don't know.
4 : Let's see
2 : Is there anything more important?
4 : Or you could just trade it to me I guess where ever.
2 : Yeah I could just send it to you
2 : That'd be easier
4 : So maybe I'll
4 : Maybe I'll go here,
4 : give you this
4 : Oh shoot but then you have to throw away- Well you can throw away the fire right?
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Not the end of the world.
2 : Hmm
3 : Do it, would I do that right now?
4 : Or
4 : You have to yeah, or we could
4 : Yeah
4 : do we wanna do that, I don't know
1 : I got two of them
4 : Yeah I know
2 : Where were you at?
4 : I was here, yeah
2 : Were you here?
2 : You could also move one diagonal and shore up that one, cause you're Explorer
4 : That's true
4 : Oh yeah it has one of those things, yeah.
2 : Yeah
4 : Alright,
4 : yeah maybe I'll just do that.
3 : Wait do you wanna keep this then?
4 : Yeah, I guess I should probably save it.
2 : I feel like we should
2 : try to keep them alive as much as
4 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Actually you could
2 : Wait never mind, that's not
2 : Wait which one of these are flipped over? That's still up right?
2 : Never mind
3 : If we are trying to get it, we should keep an eye on the time
3 : So I think, I think we used a lot of it already
4 : Oh yeah
4 : Yeah, ok I'm gonna go here, shore this up, then I'll go here, so then if you give me those
2 : Oh
2 : What
1 : Oh, I didn't know the clock was running.
4 : Two, two of these, I can at least cash in. Although I'm gonna have to throw something away now.
4 : We'll see what happens.
2 : (--)
4 : Water's Rise and a chalice so
4 : oh which one should I throw away?
3 : Mm
4 : (--)
4 : It's tough
3 : Good question
4 : Uh
1 : You're here right now, huh?
4 : No I'm done here.
4 : Um
4 : the only thing is we don't have any of these, we only have one
2 : (--)
1 : If we have lots of chalices, we could cash in if we could get em to uh
4 : (--)
4 : I'll get rid of this one (--)
3 : Oh wait, wait, wait
3 : actually keep the chalice cause next turn I can come to you and just give you both of these with my other two actions and that gives you four
4 : (--)
2 : Well we also have to
2 : keep in mind how many of each we're throwing away
2 : We already threw away at least
2 : We've thrown away any chalices yet?
4 : Oh that's true
3 : But look how big this deck is actually
3 : There's probably a lot
2 : Uh huh
4 : Yeah
2 : That's true.
1 : Hopefully they're even now
4 : Yeah so I'll throw away one of
3 : Yeah I have no, I have no idea what it looks like.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
4 : These guys I guess
2 : Yeah
4 : (--) one of that's gonna sink but
1 : We only have to get three out of four treasures anyway, right?
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Alright
1 : Oh
2 : Ok, so we're just gonna shuffle these
4 : Yeah this goes up one.
2 : Oh then draw three
4 : Yeah go for it.
3 : That clock moves
3 : so fast.
4 : Temple of the Sun, don't really
4 : Whispering Garden
4 : and
2 : Breaking
4 : Break
2 : Bridge
4 : Breaker's Bridge
4 : (--)
4 : Engineer
1 : Help
1 : I can do two
3 : Mmhmm
1 : and that would be one action, so
4 : Mmhmm
1 : And then um
1 : I probably should give you a chalice, right?
2 : Well
1 : for a
4 : Uh well he has two of them already um
2 : It's gonna take more than one action, we- he can't do a diagonal one.
2 : Right?
4 : Yeah
4 : no
2 : Oh wait, where are you?
1 : This is me, and I can save these both in one action.
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, do that for sure.
2 : Can you- Ok, never mind.
1 : And then
1 : um and that would save you
1 : using up an action, you could just give him
1 : one chalice and then he'll have four when he gets to him.
1 : But are you near one?
4 : Uh, yeah I'm on one right now.
3 : He's on it right now, yeah
4 : Um
4 : he can get me two on his turn actually
4 : um
1 : Cause I don't know what else I should do.
4 : Yeah I would shore those up and then if you come to me I can give you- Or he's gonna give me this (--)
3 : Yeah, cause I'm gonna have nothing to shore up cause I'm moving to him
3 : here
3 : and then I'll have nothing around me to do, if nothing changes.
3 : So maybe just shore up
3 : and I'll use
3 : these.
1 : I'm just saying what should I do to use up my move?
1 : Cause that's one move, that's one um
3 : Oh so you have nothing to do then?
1 : on action.
1 : No I can do two more things
1 : Should I move or just (stop)
4 : You could give something to the Messenger.
1 : Give you cards?
4 : You move to the Messenger's spot and then give him something.
4 : Just so that he can
4 : to trade it easier
3 : And the Messenger can give it to anybody.
2 : Yeah
2 : I (--)
3 : It's bet- It's better for you to thave all the cards
4 : Yeah
1 : Is that, is that an action when I give him a card on the same spot? It is
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
2 : (--) so I'm gonna need cards (--)
2 : giving these away
4 : Yeah we gotta move
1 : Ok so flip these two?
1 : Right?
1 : Flip em both
3 : Yeah I think that's a good idea.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok that's one action
2 : Ok
1 : Now I go two, three, but I can't give him a card
2 : Oh I'm the, I'm the gray
3 : Yeah, it would be here
4 : No, no, no, you can't
4 : Yeah, go there
1 : Oh ok
4 : And you can give him, maybe the purple one just so that
3 : And then you can
1 : Ah and then
4 : Cause we don't have
1 : But I'm not giving you a chalice, so maybe I should give you
4 : No, he's ok, he has two. Don't worry about that
1 : Ok
1 : alright
3 : Yeah
3 : I think we're playing it right
4 : Alright
1 : Yeah and then what I get
2 : (They should wait)
4 : Two treasure cards
2 : (--)
2 : What if he gives me a chalice and so I can give it to him next turn cause I can't give away
2 : I can't give you two cards
2 : or I can, I don't know.
4 : We can fly to me and give me both the chalices and then we can just cash that out in one turn.
3 : Yeah that's what I was thinking.
2 : Ok
2 : Whatever, let's just go with that.
2 : Um
4 : Alright two treasure cards
3 : So then I- your treasure
2 : So is that your fourth?
4 : Cool
1 : Helicopter Lift, good we've got three of them
2 : Ok, we should just use these Lifts
3 : Ok so those
3 : Yeah, those are more common than I thought
1 : So I'm at five, I'm good then
1 : Three of these, oh my gosh.
2 : Ok, so this is gone.
4 : Oh shoot
2 : And we lost the
2 : (chalice)
3 : We need the card also
4 : Temples of the Sun,
2 : No, not the chalice
1 : Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : Crimson Forest,
4 : gone.
3 : Oh
2 : Ok
4 : K
1 : Well that's ok, those cards won't hurt us if there's
1 : duplicates in there.
3 : Hopefully
4 : Uh
4 : Messenger
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : um
3 : we're running outta time so fast
2 : Ok
2 : Uh
2 : so I can't really give you cards
3 : Cause then you'd have to discard
4 : Right
2 : Well, eh if you'd be able
4 : But you could give it to him- Can you give him- Well then he has to do something
2 : I could give you one, we could just give up on the purple one
1 : Just go back uh
3 : Yeah
4 : Well (--), if he doesn't give me the chalice is the
4 : then I would have to get rid of all but one, yeah
2 : Oh, he's giving you the chalices?
2 : Uh
4 : I think that's a really good bet
3 : Oh yeah you're gonna have to discard
3 : two in the next turn anyway
4 : Yeah
2 : So we're gonna have to find another of these then
2 : Ah
3 : Mm
3 : Yeah we should
2 : Jeez
4 : Unless you end up- Can you get to
4 : (--)
3 : Oh wait, I can move you right now
3 : to him
3 : and then
2 : I don't- I can give him cards at any
3 : I know but he can't give you anything.
4 : But if he flies me there late I can give him like
4 : my lions before
4 : uh I cash in the goblet things
1 : But you can
3 : We'd have to wait another rotation
4 : Oh wait
4 : that's true, never mind. Yeah
1 : You can fly two people at once
3 : Yeah
4 : If they're on the same square
1 : For- Is that, it's one action for you when it's your turn
3 : It would just be this card
2 : Yeah
3 : I don't- Does this count as an action?
2 : You could fly us-
2 : Might be good if we're all on the same spot. You could fly us
1 : I think you can do it anytime
2 : to there.
3 : Special action cards
4 : Yeah you can- Doesn't count as an action
4 : It's just a- it's just your card
3 : Does- Oh yeah, it says right on it, does not count as an action.
2 : Um
2 : yeah uh I'll probably shore up this
2 : Just do it for one action
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah we can play em at this
1 : Play em anytime
2 : Um
2 : I feel like we should get on the same spot maybe
2 : so we can trade cards cause we're gonna need to do that, I don't know.
2 : Maybe you could
2 : we could all go there or all go there
2 : with one of the Helicopter cards.
3 : I'll go to which one?
2 : I don't know, either there or there.
2 : Just so we can trade cards
2 : in the next
4 : Yeah, that's a good idea
4 : Yeah maybe just come to there, cause he can come to me easier
2 : Do we have-
2 : ok.
4 : And then we can all
2 : Oh yeah, ok
4 : Yeah do you wanna play a Lift, somebody?
2 : So
3 : Yeah, wait, I'm confused just about what- where you wanna go
2 : Use one of the Helicopter Lifts and fly us
4 : Skip both
4 : these guys, see.
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : and then
2 : I have one more action
3 : I just hope that doesn't put us in trouble if we start flooding.
4 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : is there any cards
2 : that we're good to shore up?
2 : Whispering Garden
4 : Maybe
3 : Maybe save that for
4 : There was just- Yeah that's true
2 : Save it, yeah
3 : for next turn
2 : Ok, maybe I'll just end
4 : Alright
4 : yeah
2 : K
2 : got two fire- Oh we forgot about
4 : Oh that we have to use it
4 : (--) have to do something now.
3 : You have one, two, three, four
2 : What am I at, six?
4 : Yeah
3 : five, six.
2 : Um
2 : I feel like we're not gonna get this
1 : Well how many min- how many actions have you to-
3 : Yeah that
4 : Yeah that's right we only need three, so yeah
1 : How many actions have you taken?
3 : that's our least
4 : Yeah let's just forget about that one
2 : Um
2 : well I already went through the action phase, I don't think I can do it again.
4 : Yeah, he's done.
4 : Now Water's Rise
3 : You already drew
4 : I mean, I mean the
4 : Water's cards, yeah
1 : Cause you flew him right, with your card?
1 : Uh
2 : Yeah I had one action left but I think, there's just like
3 : Yeah
1 : That doesn't count as an action for anybody
4 : It's, it's too late now. He already drew his treasure cards
3 : No
2 : a phase, oh
1 : Ok
2 : Tidal Palace,
1 : Cause I was thinking if he- Or
2 : Copper Gate,
1 : If he
2 : Lost Lagoon.
3 : Once he draw, once he draws I think it's
4 : Copper Gate and what?
2 : Lost Lagoon,
2 : here it is.
4 : K
2 : Ok, I'm done.
4 : K
3 : Ok
4 : Pilot
3 : so
3 : I'm gonna move here.
2 : Um wait
3 : Right?
2 : Ok yeah
2 : that's fine.
2 : (--)
3 : We're on the same
3 : And then
3 : other two actions are to give these two to you.
4 : Ok and then I'll get rid of
4 : two of these- these two.
2 : Ok
3 : K then I draw two
3 : So we got lion and earth
3 : and then
4 : K
3 : flood cards, three of them.
4 : Three of these
2 : Caves of Shadows,
2 : Dunes of Deception,
4 : Caves of Shadows
2 : Silver Gate
4 : Silver Gate, k.
4 : Alright
4 : cool.
4 : They're with mine
4 : I'll cash these four in
4 : to get
4 : this
4 : bad boy
4 : and then
4 : I'll give you-
4 : Should I give you lion?
3 : Oh wait I would shore up something.
4 : Well I can do that too
4 : I'll still have one more.
3 : Oh oh
4 : I can shore up the Dune
1 : I can do two of them from here
4 : or the Shadows of the Cave.
1 : as one motion if you'd
1 : think there's something else useful maybe you should do.
4 : Yeah
4 : Unless we hit it again- Oh it just, it just happens, it just happened.
3 : Yeah if we, if we get a
3 : if we get a flood ca-
2 : Ok I can get rid of this at anytime so I can shore up one of them, um
2 : that way we'd need
4 : Maybe
2 : I could just like do that one
4 : Yeah, sure
2 : Ok
4 : Well we already have that one though.
4 : Oh wait-
3 : Oh wait, wait, we just got the
3 : the chalice, right?
2 : Oh, sorry, um
1 : Cause do we, do we wanna make it the next one we need, like maybe
1 : here.
4 : Well we're all pretty close, luckily.
4 : Ah you're already this one
2 : Yeah
4 : I mean
2 : Actually we-
2 : if you get a,
2 : if you get one of the Waters Rising we should
4 : Well if we get it- That's true, that's true, should we just do this one? Cause we're all- We have these three right in proximity, that's nice.
2 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : We actually don't have to move anywhere, we could just, we could stay and win like that.
2 : Yeah
3 : Just stay put.
2 : Yeah
2 : K I'll use that
3 : On my little section
4 : Alright and then I'll give you a lion
4 : or should I
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Give it to him cause he can give it to anybody
4 : Ok
4 : Alright then (--) your cards we have six minutes.
4 : Alright
3 : Time to pick up the pace
4 : And then three of these bad boys
3 : It's gonna be a
4 : One, two, three
3 : Whispering
4 : Cave of Embers, Howling Garden,
4 : Howling Garden,
2 : You got Howling Garden?
4 : and Bronze Gate.
4 : K
2 : Ok I'm good.
2 : Then you can do these two
1 : K that's one move
2 : Um
1 : Uh do you want me to give you these two?
4 : Uh
4 : Well he's got the lion- Uh he's close on lions.
3 : He, he can't take anymore
2 : Mm
2 : Yeah I'm gonna have to give it to you
4 : Shoot
2 : probably.
2 : Um
4 : Yeah I think we're
3 : Yeah you should take the fire ones on his next turn
2 : (--)
2 : Or you can give
3 : That way I can give you the
2 : Oh though you guys both have spots open, maybe you should give two to
2 : him or something. Like two fires
3 : That's ok- Yeah actually, we're all in the same place
2 : Let's just spread the cards around
4 : That's true
1 : Ok, that'll be my moves then right?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : that's three.
4 : (--)
3 : That's a good idea
1 : And then
2 : And then two cards
1 : I guess I'm done.
2 : Water Rise
1 : They always have cards
2 : Helicopter Lift
1 : Another Helicopter Lift
4 : That's true
3 : Uh
4 : Ok
3 : Ok so those are definitely more common.
4 : K
1 : But we're still with three
2 : Ok
1 : I don't think we're shuffling these
2 : Yeah
1 : Water's Rise
3 : It's gonna be down to the wire
2 : Whispering Gardens ok, I lost that.
4 : K Whispering Garden
1 : Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden
1 : Lost Lagoon is gone
4 : K
1 : Yeah
4 : Lost, in fact.
1 : This one goes again
4 : Ok, yeah, take this out.
2 : Ok
4 : Alright
2 : Um
3 : And
2 : Is that everything?
3 : That's it.
4 : Messenger
3 : Now it's your turn to (--)
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : so I'm gonna give you this
4 : Give me a fire, yes
4 : Thank you
2 : And then
2 : do I have to be on the tile to claim it or just adjacent to it?
4 : On it I think, yeah.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, I'm concerned that we get that cause that one's really far away.
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna move
2 : I think I'm gonna move to here so I can
2 : Claim this- No, I don't know, it probably won't matter.
2 : Is there any
4 : The only thing is he'll have to come to you to give you the other lion, that's I mean
2 : Oh yeah never mind I shouldn't move. Ok
2 : Um
2 : I don't know if there's anything useful I can do right now
4 : Yeah
2 : I don't think, I'll just
4 : Ok
4 : You just gonna go quick, four minutes
3 : Uh
1 : If, if, if you, if you give him the last one can he grab that one?
1 : Or does he have to wait for his, for his next turn, yeah
3 : On his next turn
4 : Yeah he has to wait
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok that puts me at six, I'm gonna get rid of this
4 : K
1 : Yeah
2 : Uh
4 : Water's Rise
3 : (--)
4 : I mean
4 : (--) flood cards
3 : We've
2 : Two

3 : And I hope, and I hope that's not bad
4 : Well
2 : Alright, then I'm done.
4 : Alright
4 : so
3 : Ok so
3 : one action is to give this to you
2 : Yup
3 : right?
3 : Now you have to discard something
2 : Yeah, ok, (doesn't matter).
4 : Ok
4 : Easy
3 : Um
2 : We're gonna make it
3 : ok and then
2 : (--)
2 : Gotta be quick

2 : shore that up
1 : Shore this up now?
2 : Yeah since it has one of the- it's one of the place we could
2 : obtain that
2 : Wind statue I think that's called.
1 : So I can shore this up
1 : Because I
1 : went on it?
1 : is it
2 : Because you're on it or because you're next to it right?
3 : Ok
3 : Next to it, right.
1 : Oh ok
3 : You can do up to three of those so you could do
1 : Oh right ok so move adjacent I just did that now I can
1 : Shore up because it's adjacent
1 : And
3 : You could do two more if you wanted to
1 : I can-
1 : I-

1 : Move
3 : No no you can shore up.
1 : adjacent
1 : two more
1 : oh ok so this one

1 : Draw two treasure deck cards please

1 : Um
1 : Mmkay
1 : So I have to do something with the Water's Rise
1 : So move the water level up one tick
2 : We-
2 : Yeah
1 : Shuffle the flooded discard pile and place it one top of the
1 : flood draw pile
1 : um discard this card to the treasure
1 : discard pile
2 : and then we have to take two of these right?
1 : K
1 : Mm
2 : Oh
3 : No
1 : I don't think so
2 : Cool
3 : No
2 : That's fine
1 : Um
1 : And now, oh well now I do
2 : Yeah
1 : Draw two
1 : Draw Flood cards equal to the water level which is two, ok.
1 : Um so I have Whispering Garden and Cliffs of Abandon

2 : as two
2 : and
2 : probably
2 : shore up Cliffs of Abandon as well
1 : K
1 : Ok can you do that?
1 : Shore up two?
1 : I'm not sure, cause I thought that
1 : The Engineer does two, right?
2 : Take up to three actions
1 : Because didn't each one have
1 : a couple like
1 : You can do certain things
1 : I thought
2 : Yeah I could
2 : Give cards from a different place
1 : Yeah
1 : Where's my card?
1 : ok
1 : Shore up to two tiles for one action.
1 : So then
2 : For one action. So I used my two actions. One to flip this and one to flip that one.
1 : Hah, oh
1 : Ok gotcha, alright.
2 : yeah
2 : um ok so then done with that one, and now I take these two
1 : Mhmm
2 : so I have a Sandbags and two of these

2 : phantom Rock has just sunk
1 : Ok, I don't see
2 : So has Lost Lagoon

1 : All done
3 : Ok I ah, I can to draw two Treasure car- well two Treasure cards
1 : Ok
3 : One, two
3 : Helicopter Lift again
3 : And
3 : that
3 : And then I can

1 : which is two right now.
3 : Two right?
2 : Did you want to move anywhere as well?
1 : One, two
3 : Well I can do that too afterwards
2 : Ok
2 : Ok great.
1 : Ok
3 : And so we have- I have to flood Golden- Gold Gate and Breaker's Bridge so
3 : Gold Gate
3 : Is done
1 : Ok
1 : And throw that card out
2 : And so that card will go out as well
3 : Yeah (--)
3 : And Breaker's Bridge
2 : Also done
3 : Is also done well this is getting
1 : Yeah
3 : Slim here isn't it?
2 : Goin' quick
1 : Oh
3 : And I can shore up, there's nothing to shore up.
3 : Ok
1 : Ah ok yeah
3 : and I can give a treasure tile
3 : if on same card so
3 : I
3 : Nothing, ok and I'm gonna stay there too, on helicopter Landing just in case you know something happens we can all get off of there right?
1 : Ok
2 : Right
2 : yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So I'm- I'm- I'm gonna propose a strategy then of that next time we shore up things before drawing the Forbidden island.
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah so that
1 : If we're
1 : Wait what did, oh ok.
2 : In case we- right cause, although I don't know if we could have if you were anywhere
3 : Right
2 : close except that you could have probably flown to them
3 : I could have moved to one- one of those
3 : Four there are already there anyway
2 : But yeah, well and but you can fly anywhere anytime as well, so
3 : Well I can fly anywhere that's true
1 : Oh
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
3 : Oh, ok well I wanted to stay there just
2 : Yeah oh yeah for sure
3 : Yeah just to that's
2 : Well now I'm gonna hold on to the Sandbags so that in case that one gets
3 : Ok
3 : there you go
1 : Yeah
1 : Oh
3 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : Ok so
1 : Let me look at this again
2 : Um
1 : Ok move adjacent, shore up we don't need, give a treasure card
1 : Um
1 : We need four treasure cards to
2 : Mhmm
1 : collect it?
3 : Three out of four, oh yes four treasure cards
1 : Ok
3 : Three treasures
1 : Um
1 : Ok so now
1 : Um capture a treasure
2 : So which one do we think we could
1 : So I think I'm gonna m-
1 : move
1 : adjacent
1 : Oh
1 : I'll just do
2 : We could move there and then
1 : One two three
1 : right and that'll just be
2 : then those are your three, those are your three turns?
3 : Well aren't you
3 : What's that one-, what is who you have right there, who are those?
1 : This?
2 : Those are the fire things.
3 : Yeah
1 : The fire things
2 : So you could move here, here and then here.
2 : To the Cave of Shadows
1 : (put them on)
2 : and be close
1 : Oh and then if one of you guys get the card then I could collect it
2 : Yeah if they're on the same or if I get the
1 : Oh
2 : Fire then I could give it to you from wherever I am
3 : Right
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : One two three
3 : There right?
1 : That would make more sense
1 : Um
2 : Then you get
1 : Two
2 : These two
1 : Right ok
1 : Um
1 : Sweet
1 : Ok
3 : There you go, so now you got it
1 : Yeah
2 : We're gettin' closer now.
1 : Um and then
1 : Wait I can have
1 : Up to five ok
2 : Yeah
1 : And then draw
1 : flood cards equal to the
1 : number which is two
1 : Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon
3 : Well now you have too many cards
3 : You need, you're allowed up to five cards so you have to discard
2 : Right but these, these are flood cards
1 : There
3 : Oh those are flood cards, ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Not an action
1 : Um
1 : So
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : and
1 : Iron Gate

1 : And
1 : done
2 : Done

3 : Ok gotcha ok
2 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : Let's see
3 : Don't sink it
2 : alright, I'll try not to
1 : Yeah
2 : Is there, I can't get to any of them to-
2 : flip
2 : just yet
2 : I mean I could over there in three moves but then I couldn't ah
2 : I wouldn't have a move left to flip
2 : Or to shore up
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : I'm gonna
2 : I don't necessarily need to be
2 : close to you guys to be able to hand card cause I could do that from anywhere
3 : Right
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Well I- I could also fly on my turn
2 : Yeah ok
3 : Right to there
3 : And then hand her this card
2 : perfect ok so that's good
3 : Right
1 : Oh you need to be on the same one with me in order to give it me?

2 : Ah it has to be adjacent
3 : Oh ok I can't do anything
2 : or one of the-
2 : so
3 : um
2 : Unless you wanted to fly
2 : somewhere else
3 : I could only, let me see

1 : we have a lot of the
1 : the lion one
1 : so maybe if you flew
3 : So
1 : over there cause this one's about to sink
3 : But if I fly there can I, oh ok
3 : Then I'd be swimming so I have to fly
3 : Let me fly
1 : Would it be better to fly over to that one
3 : What if I flew back to here?
2 : Well
1 : I'm not sure how much that would
1 : Help
2 : Someone needs to have all

2 : Do you want to get
1 : Well which one do we need
2 : closer to the
3 : Well I'll go- if I move here then
2 : mm
1 : this one
2 : right but you're
2 : close here anyway
2 : that you could move one, two and collect it
2 : cause you have the four cards next time. So I don't- we don't necessarily need the Temple of the Moon.
1 : Right
3 : Ok one, oh one two ok.
1 : Oh

2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : Or, yeah or if that goes we don't care if that goes. Well no we, well right
2 : Well we'll wait until next turn when she's able to
3 : Ok now I have to draw two treasure cards
2 : collect this hopefully
3 : One
2 : Oh so you have too many
1 : Oh right
1 : Um
2 : So you need to discard one of them and if he's got more
1 : So I'm gonna
2 : Well
1 : so the
1 : blue thing again
3 : These don't count as these are
3 : Special cards ok two and I need three flood cards
1 : One, two, three four five
1 : Three, one, two
1 : three
2 : This includes
1 : This includes (--)
3 : Oh it includes special action cards ok so I have to get rid of those
3 : So
3 : I might get rid of these two since I already have one
1 : Wait but you can have
1 : five
2 : Yeah so hold on to one of the
1 : Just one yeah, mhmm
3 : Ok Crimson Forest Flood
2 : Crimson Forest where is that?
3 : Right here
2 : Ok
1 : hah
3 : And Cave of Embers we flood.
2 : And that's gone.
2 : But that's fine because we already have that treasure
3 : And Silver Gate we flood
1 : Ok
2 : Silver Gate
3 : That, I've never heard of that, oh here it is. That one's ok
1 : Ok
3 : Ok we're done
1 : Um
1 : Ok so you're done?
3 : I'm done
1 : Ok
1 : Um so
1 : I'll
1 : take
2 : well you need to move to the
1 : Oh right
2 : that piece first
1 : One
1 : I just need one right? I just need to be adjacent to it? Or on it?
2 : Not you need to
2 : No you need to be on it to collect the
1 : Oh ok
1 : Two
2 : item.
1 : Three
1 : Thank you
2 : And then so those go in the discard
1 : Ok
1 : Almost there!
2 : Alright
2 : Well done so we just need one more.
1 : Um so
1 : I'm assuming we're gonna
1 : try to do the Lion one.
2 : Yeah
1 : So
2 : Do you have, so that was your
2 : third move there right? Ok.
1 : that was my third
1 : So draw two treasure cards.
2 : cards
1 : cards um so two
3 : Oh cool, ok
1 : So
1 : K
2 : And then
3 : And then your three- three crummy flood cards
1 : Then
1 : draw
1 : Three flood cards
1 : Um
1 : So Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Howling Garden
1 : and Bronze Gate
3 : Howling Garden and Bronze Gate ok
1 : Which doesn't matter
2 : Right here
1 : Howling
3 : Oh
3 : I need Cliffs of Abandon flood card
3 : please
1 : Oh that's all done, yeah ok
3 : Right right thank you
1 : and
1 : and, ok.
1 : Flood
2 : Ok
2 : My turn?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yes
2 : Does not count as an action, I'm going to save- I'm gonna Sandbag up Howling Garden right here.
1 : Good idea.
2 : Cause that's where we're headed.
2 : Um
2 : and
2 : I am here
2 : and I forget if I'm trapped like that and can't move
2 : side to side can I move anywhere?
1 : You can move up
2 : Ok
1 : Or wait
1 : wait
1 : You just took one action up right?
3 : Which one
2 : I haven't used an action yet.
1 : Didn't you Sandbag?
2 : It says the special cards don't use an action.
1 : Oh so what if you
1 : Oh well I guess that doesn't
1 : No
2 : We already have that treasue so at this point
3 : You-
3 : You're not allowed to move diagonally it's only Engineer right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : But I'm
1 : I'm thinking
1 : because if this sinks then you're
1 : In the middle of the ocean and then you can't do anything and then the games over.
1 : So if you
2 : Right
1 : flip this over
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Mm
2 : Cause I can't move anywhere anyway
1 : That's
1 : Or yeah so flip it- flip it over
2 : And then I'm gonna give somebody a
1 : And then just
2 : card who's close to getting one
3 : I have two of these
1 : Yeah give him
2 : So I'm gonna give you
3 : Well then I'm gonna have to get rid of a card too, though
2 : Ok
3 : That- which is fine. I have two Helicopter Lifts I'll just get rid of
1 : Oh
2 : Well unless oh cause you can only use them on your turn
2 : Um right?
2 : Or no thyey can be used at any time
3 : Right
2 : Where's the Helicopter Lift
3 : Play at any time.
2 : You can move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile.
2 : Hmm.
2 : So you
2 : wait if you- you could use one of the Helicopter Lift cards to move me
2 : closer
3 : Right but I have two of those already
2 : Right
3 : So
2 : So we need to save one to get us all off of the island but you get one
3 : Oh
2 : to bring me
2 : away from
2 : possible drownage
3 : Ok so we want to keep that so I could- I'd have to get rid of a Sandbag?
3 : or she could get
3 : well no, you don't want to
2 : I'm just
2 : thinking in terms of if you can only have five at a time if you wanted to use one of those
3 : Or
2 : preemptively
2 : like now
3 : Oh like now?
2 : Just to
2 : Just to move me
3 : Yeah fly you um
2 : Maybe over towards Howling Garden if that's the card that we're gonna go for?
3 : That's fine
3 : You'll get right on there
2 : Thank you
1 : Hmm
3 : Ok
2 : And now I'll give you this card
3 : Thank you
1 : Here
2 : And my turn is over there so I'll take these two
2 : And of course get another one
1 : Ah
2 : Ah
2 : And then
2 : Three of these
2 : Thanks
2 : Dunes of Deception
1 : I don't think we've done- yeah
2 : Uh Coral Palace
2 : That's right here
2 : And the third is Tidal Palace
2 : Yeah so we're gonna need to save, well not necessarily one of those
2 : And all set
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : I have to move first don't I?
2 : This is yeah
1 : Do you wanna- how many of those Lions do you have?
3 : I have, I need one Lion. So what I can do is lift you
1 : So
2 : Yup
1 : You can give me
2 : Well let's save one of the Helicopter Lifts to escape
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok what I think I'd like to do is take a Sandbag
3 : ans shore up one of these two
1 : Oh right cause yeah
3 : Cause those are just you know um
2 : What, what color are you?
3 : Um blue
3 : I'm right here
2 : Well you're right here you could just
2 : shore it up
2 : Anyway
3 : Right, right so I shore that up
1 : You don't need a Sandbag
2 : And hold the- hold on to that card
3 : Ok
3 : Ok cool that's one and so I could shore this up too.
2 : That's one
2 : You could
2 : But I'm
3 : Well
2 : Just to save the
2 : Space there
1 : mm
3 : (--)
3 : Yeah the board's getting a little short
1 : Yeah
2 : Right, right
3 : Is what I'm- what I'm a little concerned about
2 : Yeah
3 : So I- I would take that for my second move
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : And my third move I'll just
1 : Wait is there um
1 : I'm just thinking ahead
1 : you
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : I need to be
1 : On the Lion one
3 : Yeah and where are you?
1 : To give you this card, so can you
3 : And what color are you?
2 : Well no you just need to be on the same card.
1 : Oh so
3 : So you could move yourself
2 : To
2 : Next turn
3 : Next turn I could take, I have one more move
2 : Yeah
1 : One
1 : Two three
1 : Yeah but I would have to move one, two, three
3 : No
3 : No, I'm right here
2 : You could move
1 : Oh you're blue oh ok
3 : Yeah so you could move right here and then give me the Lion card and then we'd have the lion
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : That's the last one.
1 : Oh ok yeah
3 : So I have a third turn though and um
3 : But I don't have to take it
3 : Do I?
3 : No
2 : No
2 : Um
1 : Uh
2 : Unless you just wanted to move one closer and she could go one two and then give you the card.
3 : The-
2 : And then we'd all be closer to Fool's Landing anyway
3 : Well we have to be on the same tile
2 : Yeah
3 : see, so
3 : I don't- I don't think I wanna move further away
2 : No you would just, you would move to Watchtower
3 : Ok I could move to Watchtower and she could come one, two.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : for the next
3 : Ok I could do that I could (--) so I need um
1 : two treasure cards
3 : two treasure cards
3 : this one
3 : we already have that don't we
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : and the Chalice
2 : And we need
2 : need to get rid of one of those cards
3 : Oh wait since we already have this I can get rid of that right?
2 : Or
2 : some
2 : Yeah wait how many? Five tar- five cards total?
3 : Now I have six though
1 : Mmmmm
2 : So maybe get rid of
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh no well no cause I have these three right.
3 : So I have six so I have to get rid of
2 : you could
1 : so
2 : get rid of probably the
1 : Yeah
3 : That one
2 : Chalice if we're not going for it
3 : Right
2 : Alright
3 : And then I need three flood cards
2 : We have
3 : Watchtower
2 : Right here
3 : Ok
2 : And then Misty March
2 : And Temple of the Sun
3 : Temple of the Sun, ok.
2 : which is
2 : this one
2 : These all go here
3 : Ok I'm done
2 : Alright
1 : Ok so
1 : I'll give you
1 : This
2 : No you have to be on the same. You have to be on the same one
3 : You have to move
3 : You'll have to move twice- two
1 : Oh ok
2 : So
1 : One, two I keep thinking you're the gray one
3 : Right
1 : Um
3 : That's one
1 : One, two, that was two
3 : Two moves ok
1 : Two right? and then three
3 : Ok and then we get this
1 : So do we
2 : Ah we have to get
1 : Oh
1 : (--)
2 : If you want to use one of the Sandbags
2 : to save
2 : Cause you can only have five at a time
3 : Oh
2 : So you c-
3 : Ok so I could do that. Yeah let's do the Sandbag
2 : Right you could use up the Sandbags
2 : And maybe save Watchtower
2 : Cause you guys are both on it right now? Yeah
3 : Yeah cause we don't want two of us swimming on there right? That wouldn't be cool, ok
1 : Yeah
1 : Um
3 : Ok that goes in there
2 : Ok
2 : Ah
3 : But you still get to, you still get
3 : Um
1 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : But don't you have to get rid of the Helicopter one too?
2 : No
3 : No
1 : Cause there's
2 : Right cause you can get up to five
1 : Oh there's five
3 : Right
1 : Right ok
3 : So I have four and then do I take- wait for my turn to take this
2 : Yeah you have to get over here first
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
3 : (--)
1 : So two treasure cards
2 : those did you
2 : Did I just give you those?
3 : (--)
2 : No
1 : Ah no
2 : Ok
1 : No
1 : Um ok Helicopter and then
1 : Move water level up a tick
3 : Ugh
1 : Um shuffle the flood card
1 : The flood discard pile and place it on top of the flood draw pile
1 : Discard
2 : I feel like I could be responsible for
1 : Yeah
2 : the flooding
1 : Discard, this card in the treasure discard pile
2 : finally
1 : um
3 : you get to pick three
2 : and then
2 : Three of these I guess
1 : Oh three
2 : But we're pretty close
1 : Bronze Gate
1 : So
1 : Get rid of that
1 : Watchtower
3 : We're on it
1 : Ok
3 : That was good that was that was
1 : Oh no
1 : That was here
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah that was
3 : Ok
3 : Yeah that was good
1 : Good thought
1 : Um Dunes of Deception
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : flipped
1 : Ok
1 : um
2 : All set there
1 : And then I
3 : That's it
1 : Drew ok yeah
3 : These are your treasure cards so you're- you're good
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Now what is the
3 : Ok
2 : Helicopter Lift
2 : You could use that at any time. Does that have to be on your
2 : turn?
2 : Probably not
3 : No
3 : No
2 : Ok
3 : So you think we should Lift ourselves off of Watchtower?
2 : Well I'm
2 : Hmm
2 : I mean have to- we also have to get off of
2 : Fool's Landing so
3 : We have three of four- how many do you need? You need three out of the four treasures to win.
2 : Yeah, so basically we just need to get
1 : Mhmm
3 : So now we can- we- we need to have to get to here
2 : Well we need to get here first
2 : You- you need to get here
3 : Oh I have to get to there, right, ok.
2 : to collect this, and then we all need to get to Fool's Landing
3 : Right.
2 : and off.
3 : But I can fly here at any- I can fly here on my turn.
3 : Or just move one on my turn
2 : Yes.
2 : Right.
3 : so
3 : both of you have to get here.
2 : Yes.
1 : Yes.
1 : Mhmm
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : I'll move there now
3 : Right
2 : cause you have enough cards right there
3 : But you can't move diagonally so you have to move one, two
2 : No so one,
2 : two, and I'm gonna preserve this
3 : Cool
2 : for my third.
3 : That's good
1 : Hmm
2 : And then I'll take these two.
2 : Great, um and I'll discard this
3 : Right here, yeah
2 : and
2 : draw three Flood Cards
2 : I suppose.
2 : Coral Palace
2 : Tidal Palace
2 : oh that sunk
2 : and the third
2 : Temple of the Moon.
2 : Up at the top
3 : And you have your Treasure Cards
2 : Ok
2 : And then
2 : Yes
2 : Yeah, so I'm all done.
3 : Ok, so I'm gonna take
2 : Well you have to move
2 : move here first, you have to- cause the
2 : it has to be on that.
3 : Oh, ok
3 : so I'm blue again, I move here
2 : Mhmm
3 : as one
1 : Mhmm
3 : I take this as two
2 : Yep
1 : Mhmm
3 : and
1 : and then go to Fool's Landing
2 : I would no- I
3 : and I could go- well cause I can fly
2 : I gotta suggestion that you use your last move to move back here, and then the Helicopter Lift you can fly
2 : yours- everybody to get on that card
3 : Everybody
3 : cool, yeah
2 : so
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, three.
2 : move there
1 : Yeah
2 : and then do you want to use the Helicopter Lift to move them over
2 : to Fool's Landing?
3 : oh I could- and then we're done
2 : Cause it's a separate
2 : lift and then she could use her Helicopter Lift to lift us off.
3 : Eh eh eh
2 : so let's
1 : ah
3 : So we could both do this?
2 : Mhmm
3 : and you do that?
2 : You do that by using the Helicopter Lift card
3 : Ok and she could do that at any time? Like now?
2 : Yeah
1 : Um well y-
3 : Cause we're on the clock
2 : Right
1 : Yeah
3 : Cause we're on the clock
1 : Oh
3 : We're on the clock, tick- I don't have to
1 : Wait but
2 : So you just use your-
1 : You need to do the treasure things
3 : I don't- no, not yet
2 : No, no cause he can use it at any time
1 : Oh
3 : Any time, just take it, give it in
2 : And we're off
1 : Ok
1 : Woo!
3 : We're done
3 : Yeah cause we were on the clock
1 : We won!
3 : How did we do it? I don't know, thank you
2 : Nice, I- pffff hey I'm

4 : Cool.
1 : K so I'm the Engineer so
1 : Um I'm thinking of asking for advice but I'm thinking one of my actions should be to shore up two flooded
4 : Yeah
1 : tiles next to me. What do you guys think?
4 : I was, I was thinking shore up these, move here then shore up both of these and get all four at the same time.
1 : I think that's an awesome idea so I'm choosing to do that for my two actions, thanks for the good advice.
1 : Um I'm gonna take my um
1 : two actions like
4 : Ah
1 : that
4 : Well not in that order but it would be
2 : No
1 : C-Ca
1 : Oh well
4 : This
1 : (She's alread-)
4 : This, this, then this tehn this.
1 : Yeah he's right.
1 : He's right thanks for your help
4 : It means irrelevant but
1 : Well no your right, we should
4 : That works better following the rules
1 : Proceed in proper order you're absolutely right
4 : Cool you're
2 : Hmm
1 : Right
1 : And then um she can go
4 : No, no, no
3 : And she yeah, you need to
2 : Um
1 : Oh we gotta draw treasure cards, can you hand me, sorry I really can't reach
3 : Draw
4 : Two
1 : Or
1 : There and
4 : What did you get (fuck)
1 : Just so you guys can see unfortunately I did pick a Water's Rise card so
1 : Um
1 : Thank you (so she grabbed it) and we all know what that means
1 : It says we gotta move the water level up one tick mark
1 : And we now have to shuffle the discard pile and put it on top
1 : (And put it in the) oh I'm sorry guys
1 : And put it in top of the draw pile
1 : Discard this to the treasure
1 : I can't reach where do I put it thank you.
3 : Ok
4 : Draw two
3 : Hm
3 : Two-what
1 : Yeah
4 : It's gonna be
4 : These
4 : Over here, maybe this one.
1 : Yeah um it's like he said
4 : Yeah
4 : Oh not (oh we're not) Golden Gate
3 : Move one of the one's that you flipped
1 : Golden Gate
4 : Oh good it's not a bad thing
3 : Hmm
1 : probably not
4 : So that's why we saved it
3 : Yeah
4 : Ah what's (--) ah
3 : What's the other one
1 : That's (bigger)
4 : (fuck me)
3 : Golden Gate
4 : Hm
4 : That's unfortunate
3 : Ok
1 : Well
4 : I'll take that
1 : (we lost one, but (--))
1 : (--) so I don't
2 : Ok
4 : It doesn't matter, we don't have a yellow, there's no treasure. We need to
1 : I know
1 : I know
4 : Make sure we just keep at least one of these so you have to save them at all costs
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Three
1 : Sounds like a good strategy to me in fact it sounds like you played this before
2 : And Fool's Landing
4 : No it's just a very very simple board game.
1 : (great) idea.
1 : So I don't know.
2 : So then I can go um
3 : K
2 : This
4 : What do you wanna do?
2 : So I should just
2 : Go one
2 : mm
4 : mm
2 : I don't know
4 : Ok You know you also have special ability, um I think
4 : your biggest
4 : thing you could do to help us is you have the ability to give things to
2 : Yeah
4 : people so for example like
4 : give me
4 : the gold one there and I can focus on this
3 : That way
4 : She's gonna get the chalices, well she'll knock that out
4 : I can knock this out
4 : We could focus on her having these we'll see like where cards go
1 : Yeah and I could give you this one cause
2 : Yeah
3 : Right
4 : You know what I mean? So you should be giving things once per turn I think
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok then draw this
4 : See whoever has the most
3 : Ok
4 : Let's see, you're the only one who can do that most easily. She should be saving all the tiles from dying.
3 : Now, here?
2 : yeah
1 : I don't like it
1 : yeah I agree I just traded (--)
4 : And then you can fly us away so we don't get lost. Yeah see now if you give me that extra one I'll have three of them now
3 : Alright
1 : Sounds good
2 : mm
2 : yeah
1 : Right
4 : I can move simply here and get that
1 : Yeah
1 : (that's awesome)
2 : Oh no
2 : (--)
2 : I don't think I can take another turn
2 : So (This one)
2 : Draw
4 : That was it?
2 : phantom Rock and Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Ok (it's gone, give me the Phantom Rock)
4 : Take that
3 : And what's the other one?
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Oh
2 : Which I'm on
4 : Ok that's ok you're not done yet
1 : That's ok because we could
1 : I'm right next to it and I can go and (--)
3 : Ok
3 : So I can fly myself anywhere
1 : Yes ma'am
4 : Yeah you can
2 : Yes
3 : So tch tch
2 : Do you want to fly youself?
4 : And you have the ability to do those as well
4 : um
3 : I'm thinkin' of
4 : What do we think here (again)
3 : Cause if I fly myself over to Lost Lagoon, I can flip Lost Lagoon over
4 : (--)
3 : And save that
2 : Or Cliffs of Abandon since somebody's on it and you could still
4 : Don't go there
2 : If you draw a Water Rise card then you would have to put
4 : Yeah
2 : This back and
4 : but if it's gone it sort of doesn't matter, it's not one that's really important um.
2 : Yeah
3 : Right cause it's
1 : Plus I'm next to it and I can save it on my next turn
3 : Right l-
4 : On your turn yeah but
4 : Ah see you, we think, you're going to be the most mobile
3 : Rigth
4 : So you need to choose what you think you're gonna get so I think your you could end up getting, let's see, you kinda gonna see what you're gonna get
3 : I
3 : Right
4 : Yeah to be honest with you
4 : If you pull out a couple more of these then that's what you're going to be going with
3 : Right
4 : Cause you can just fly yourself to whatever one and gather the treasures easily
3 : To wherever I want
3 : Right
3 : So right now probably go ahead go Lost Lagoon, flip it over
3 : And then
1 : Yeah cause it's closest to the treasure (--)
4 : Try and save it yeah, I mean (--) there's no
3 : Yeah try and save it
4 : So
3 : Oh
4 : Save that one
1 : Because I could save the one next to me so yeah
3 : And limit somewhat
4 : And now you can you could just end your turn, you don't need to take all three
3 : Right
4 : Cause it doesn't like
3 : It does matter where I go right no? ok. So and then two of these.
1 : Not really
4 : Yeah like we'd all
2 : yup
1 : I'm gonna just put this back here.
3 : And I got a Helicopter
3 : Hmm?
4 : And I want, so be careful you can't draw anymore cards
4 : So you're close to her
3 : Right
1 : Yeah
4 : So maybe next time you want to give her
3 : Right
4 : that
4 : If she doesn't draw it by then
2 : Oh
2 : So (--)
3 : And then two
4 : Let's see what happens.
1 : Yep
2 : Oh no
3 : Temple of the Moon and Breaking Bridge
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : That's not good
4 : Can't lose this one
1 : But
1 : You know what I can save two on my turn so it doesn't matter I'm just gonna (--)
3 : Breaker's Bridge, yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : But, there's a fifty percent chance that when those go back in there it's gone anyway before it gets to you.
1 : Maybe
4 : So and I can't get there in time
4 : Potentially
3 : Alright
4 : Ok my turn ah so I don't really
3 : Ok now you're turn
3 : You can go diagonal
4 : think that I need to save, well, the only thing I really need to do is make sure that we don't lose this, so I'm gonna save that
1 : Yeah thank thank you.
4 : Oops
4 : Um nothing else is very important at the moment
4 : Ah so I think I'm gonna move there save that and then
1 : MMm
4 : Move myself back down here to be within range to get this
1 : Cool
4 : When I need to
4 : I'll take two treasure cards please.
4 : Which I didn't really want
4 : That should be for you.
4 : And you need this one.
1 : Yeah
4 : Ah now let's see what we got
1 : Well (--)
4 : So we got lucky we didn't get a water rising cause we could have potentially lost everything.
3 : Right
1 : Yup
1 : I know I'm sorry I (--)
4 : Whispering Garden we gotta be careful. (We) can't lose that.
4 : And Iron Gate
4 : Alright
1 : ah oh
1 : (--)
2 : (can)
1 : Alright I guess it's my turn and I could use
4 : Yeah
1 : Um advice now
1 : It would probably be good if I took one of my actions and flipped that back over huh?
4 : Well you can flip both of them, this and this?
3 : Flip both of them.
1 : Yeah I can do two that's right.
2 : No
1 : What did you say sir?
2 : Sorry
3 : It's on vibrator honey
1 : Oh
2 : It's not on mute.
4 : Yeah it's just
4 : Both
1 : Ok so yeah I will
1 : take my action and
1 : do that
4 : Eh where
1 : Do you guys think I should do a second action like?
1 : Give her this card so she can
4 : Ah
1 : You know what I mean? Make a match.
4 : Maybe
4 : Ah
2 : um
4 : You need, you're gonna eventually going to hopefully get the ah
1 : The
4 : This Water Chalice so you need to acta- you need to start getting close to it
1 : green ones
1 : I know
1 : But I don't need this one
4 : It's over there.
1 : So I'm thinking I could give you this one
4 : Well only if you're on the same tile as her
1 : Oh I'm not, I'm not
4 : I believe or if it's if you're adjacent
4 : Give a single. Nope same tile.
1 : Um
3 : Same tile
1 : Ok well I'm not
4 : Ah so gray. So if you want to, you could move here
4 : And then give that to her and then that would be your
1 : Yeah I think
4 : That'd be two actions
1 : I think I want to do that cause there's nothing else I could really save next to me unfortunate
3 : Right
4 : No
1 : Ok I'm gonna do what he said
3 : Well you gotta go on to, right.
4 : Well yeah
1 : an-
4 : You got it.
1 : I know. I know I was about to.
3 : Ok
1 : Um thanks guys.
1 : It's your turn.
3 : Ok no two of these
4 : No, no no, no no.
1 : No we gotta yeah.
1 : (--)
4 : What'd you get?
1 : Ok
1 : I'm very sorry cause
4 : Water Rise? Yeah.
1 : I got bad luck but
1 : Um
1 : Water Rise so I guess I gotta move that up
4 : And then
4 : Well first you move it up
1 : Move up the water level one tick mark
4 : What?
4 : Yeah move it up
1 : Oh wait (--)
4 : Up to three
1 : Yeah
4 : Then
4 : shuffle those up
1 : Ok
4 : And we're gonna lose
3 : Ok the Water Rise card will come back over here.
4 : Hopefully not Whispering Garden, or else I have to move a lot
1 : Ok
1 : Like he said we're gonna shuffle these up.
1 : And
4 : Too many of these God damn
1 : Ok
1 : Discard this card
1 : to the top of the treasure pile sorry guys
1 : And the other one
1 : is this one.
3 : Right
4 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah ok now keep drawing the three
3 : Draw the three
1 : Yeah
4 : Ah
1 : Lost Lagoon
4 : Do you
4 : Were we
4 : was it here before?
1 : Yeah it was at two
2 : yeah
3 : Yeah this
4 : Y- Ok
4 : It was at two, now it was, now it's
3 : Right so it's on the bottom
2 : (little)
4 : It's not up, yeah it's not up to
1 : Oh
1 : Sorry
4 : Well you moved it up two, we don't want to be up there
1 : I'm
1 : Cri- No we don't
4 : Alright
1 : Alright well I have Lost Lagoon, Whispering Garden and (--)
4 : Draw another one. You have to draw three. And this is gone that's not what I wanted.
3 : You
3 : need three cards
1 : Yeah that's what I thought
1 : And I also have the Temple of the Moon
4 : Ok this one's gone
2 : Hmm
2 : So no
1 : Sorry
4 : That's not good. Lost Lagoon
1 : Yeah he's right
1 : Eh it's over he- it's over here next to her
2 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Ah and then Temple of the Moon's right there
3 : Mm I'm under Lost Lagoon
4 : That's ok
1 : But she's ok because
4 : Well so we lost one of, so now I have to be over there
1 : I'm sorry guys.
2 : Yeah
4 : God
4 : It's not your fault. It's statistics.
1 : I know.
1 : Because the way they keep putting the same cards (--)
2 : Ok um so I'm going to
3 : Ok your turn
4 : fuck
3 : So you're able to give pieces right?
2 : Give him this.
4 : yeah that's a discard so
3 : Ok
2 : And
2 : then
2 : Should I
4 : Ah draw these so I can get rid of
3 : Well maybe not give her give you that until
2 : Should I flip
2 : this over since I'm right by it?
4 : No
4 : That's a good ide-yeah-ahh
2 : No?
2 : Since it has the one thing
4 : Ah
4 : What are you, you gonna do
4 : I mean have make choices at some point. Like we already lost one of the yellow, yellow ones, it's just gonna happen
3 : Yeah
1 : I know
4 : Um
1 : (It's a game, yeah)
4 : We're gonna have to rely on her Helicopter Lift to get us to
4 : like that should be our way to move to the places where we can capture treasures at so
1 : That makes sense
4 : But if you want to yeah there's nothing else you can do that this moment um
2 : Yeah
2 : So I'm just gonna
2 : flip this over.
4 : Yeah you need to go to it and then flip it over.
2 : Oh
4 : So you're on that now.
2 : Yeah so that's
3 : Ok so
4 : You also have Sandbag's so you can just, you could have saved it without
2 : Oh
3 : Well she can save, she can save another one without
4 : Um it's not important
4 : Well eventually she can save well
3 : So she has three turns right? So can't she?
4 : that's if
4 : Well that was, that was all three
2 : I already took
3 : Oh ok
2 : Those three
4 : That's ok cause now you're gonna, so now you're gonna have five and you pull those two and you won't have to discard anything yet.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : So it was smart to give away one to me.
2 : Yeah so I got Sandbags and another one.
4 : Now you have two Sandbags.
4 : That's the one I want
3 : (name$$$)
2 : No, don't you have these?
3 : sh
2 : (--)
2 : (--) Cliffs of A-
2 : bandon
4 : Can I, can I see them?
4 : sh
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
4 : What's the other one?
2 : Ahh
4 : Breakers
2 : Iron Gate, so we lost that.
1 : (--)
4 : Gone I'll take that
1 : sorry did you say Iron Gate? Ok
2 : No that's the wrong one
3 : And Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ok
2 : Sorry
2 : And Breaker's Bridge yeah
1 : ok
4 : Ok that's ok
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
3 : Ok now
4 : Let's just c- these count as actions right?
1 : mm
3 : Yeah, no
4 : They don't count (playdate) does not count as an action, excellent. Alright
3 : So I can
1 : K
4 : Um
3 : I can fly anyone, anywhere
4 : Yeah I kinda want you to use one of those
3 : So where do you want to fly cause I gotta get rid of a card
4 : I want. I want to go here.
3 : Ok go there.
4 : I wanna
3 : Ok
4 : have this and capture that
3 : And then
3 : I can fly myself anywhere that we need
3 : Or
1 : Yup
3 : And I can also flip something over
1 : And I can flip two more (--)
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah we don't, you dont have to use it right now I mean, unless you wanna fly. Don't
3 : So
4 : Save this
3 : Right, I'm saving that
1 : No I'm saving it for later, yeah (--)
3 : But
3 : why don't I flip two cards
3 : Cause I have
2 : Can you flip two cards?
3 : Or can I have f
4 : No she only flipped one
1 : Only I can
4 : So if you want to just fly yourself somewhere and just save a tile that's fine.
3 : Ok
4 : It would be better if this wasn't so contricted
1 : Are they all?
3 : ch, ch, ch, ch what is better to save?
4 : Um
3 : We gotta save something. Probably this one huh?
2 : Yeah but you can't
4 : I think this cause the
3 : The n- Lost Lagoon, because once we right
4 : Cause one way we can lose is if
1 : Yeah
4 : They're stranded. So if we would have got rid of here
1 : Yeah
3 : Right
4 : They would have had limited ability to get out of there. You're the only one who can fly away from everything and I can move diagonally so I can skip easily too.
3 : Right
1 : mm
1 : But I can't
4 : But they can
3 : Right
4 : Um so that was it for you unless you want to fl
3 : So that's
3 : That's two moves right?
2 : That's
4 : Well
4 : Well you flew yourself there to do that
3 : I was there
4 : Oh you're blue
3 : I'm blue. So I was there.
4 : Ok yeah
3 : So I got one more
3 : So
3 : It might be smart
4 : Um
3 : I'm going to fly here
4 : with me ?
3 : with you only because I can do s
3 : two people I can move two
4 : You can move us both
4 : yeah
1 : Oh (--)
3 : If need be at some point
4 : What?
4 : What are you pointin' at
2 : only once per turn
4 : Oh I think she, she didn't fly
4 : she was here
4 : You started here didn't you?
1 : (choo)
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah I started there
1 : (shoo)
4 : Then she flipped it, then she flew here.
4 : She never actually flew anywhere.
3 : Right I never moved myself.
1 : (shoo)
4 : She used
4 : Helicopter Lift to fly me.
1 : Yeah she didn't actually play them
3 : Yeah
4 : Which is different then hers
4 : Um
3 : Ok so now this
4 : See what you draw
4 : Hopefully not Waters, Ooooo
3 : Ok
4 : That's very convenient
1 : That's awesome
3 : And then
4 : So either you can give it to me
4 : and I'll capture that or she can give it to me if we're on the same tile
3 : And ch ch ch, three
4 : three
1 : And
1 : Maybe we could trade a bunch and like
3 : Three (st- na- )
4 : Yeah
1 : I could give you that one and you could trade me so I could meet
3 : Messenger, three
2 : Oh
1 : Do you want
1 : that or (--)
4 : Mmhmm. Yeah I'm I'm savin' this one for you.
3 : Three not four.
2 : No I keep grabbing
1 : Cool
1 : I'm saving this one for you
3 : Oh ok
4 : Wow, I don't know if I want to be the one that gets it.
1 : (--)
1 : and you want
3 : Ok Copper Gate
1 : Right
2 : Copper Gate
4 : Copper Gate
4 : What else
1 : Or I could just go over to
4 : Crimson Forest, ok what else
3 : Crimson Forest and Temple of the Sun
4 : Ok Temple of the Sun, we gotta
1 : Ok
1 : Temple of the Moon is there but not the sun
2 : We've
3 : Ok
4 : Shuffe them one two
1 : (oh I thought we were oh ok)
4 : Ok
4 : So now
3 : Mm
3 : k you're turn, so
1 : It's your turn
4 : Yeah so I really can't
4 : I don't even really want to
4 : Necessarily do anything
1 : You don't have to
4 : Um
4 : So I want to keep these I wanted to get rid of these two, when I draw two
4 : um
4 : What I can do, cause you already have five, you have five
3 : Ok question
1 : I only have three so
4 : I can't give anything to you.
1 : I only got three
4 : two three, one two
4 : No this is not gonna help
4 : If I could get to you in two turns, I could give you this.
4 : But I can't, I can only get there in three turns so therefore I'm using all of my actions.
4 : But you can't die
4 : Alright well I don't think I can do anything.
4 : Um
3 : But can you give it
4 : Cause I don't want to lose these.
3 : No you can't give it to me cause I have five cards.
4 : Nmhmm.
4 : I can't
1 : I only have three but he's not no anywhere near them
3 : Ah
4 : So don't, I could give you like
4 : I could give you
4 : One of these if you think you're cause you're the most mobile like I said, well yeah but you're not gonna you don't need this cause I'm gonna get that
3 : But I have
3 : I have
4 : Like you don't need that one
3 : Yeah (--)
4 : You know what I mean? Like once I gather this, it doesn't matter anymore. These are useless then cause I already captured it. So I could give you this or this
3 : Right.
4 : Probably this cause she already has two of those
4 : By the end of the day there's
4 : probably at least five times as many as the- of these in there as we need, so
1 : Probably.
4 : Um, what do you think? Cause you can go anywhere you want.
1 : Makes sense
3 : Well I was thinking if you give me this because we're trying to get all of those to her
3 : Ok that way on my next turn I can tran-f-try- right
4 : you can fly and then trade both
4 : Yeah and then she's pretty close. Ok, I like that.
3 : Right.
1 : Um
2 : Yeah but you already have five don't you so you're gonna have
4 : Yeah but she'll just get rid of this cause she doesn't need it. You're gonna give me that.
3 : Hmm?
1 : (But I don't)
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : You'll get yours
4 : And then I will
3 : Well
3 : We've been getting rid of these
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : There
3 : So we might as well stick with getting rid of one subject.
4 : Yeah it's a little risky but yeah. I I
3 : Don't know, don't don't know how many cards of each one is in there.
4 : No I, I, I like your
1 : I like your thought though
4 : I like your strategy, I'll take that.
3 : You know.
4 : Although I would have just gotten rid of that. The gold one since you don't need it.
3 : Yeah but you don't know how many's in there and we know
1 : No you don't it's
4 : We don't
3 : Yeah
1 : Mainly cause
4 : Ah and that's all I really want to do um cause I'm gonna get rid of this in a minute. Can I have two of those?
1 : to make sure
3 : Cause I'm the one, that I can get to one of those if need be
4 : Yeah Water's Rising (--) another one.
1 : K
4 : Alright so, one two three four five
4 : Get rid of this
4 : And this now, raise it up one.
4 : Shuffle those back into there.
4 : (and we still gotta raise) three
4 : That's not good.
4 : Ah-Ay-yeah then just one, two
4 : three, We're gonna lose some things here.
1 : Yeah
4 : Copper
4 : Lost Lagoon
3 : Copper gate
4 : Crimson Forest's gone, Copper Gate's gone.
1 : K
4 : Ok
1 : K I guess it's my turn. I could use some advice here but
1 : Um and I get up to three turns but I think one obvious move would be to turn this back over
4 : Um
4 : Yeah I mean well
4 : Yeah if you want
4 : Then you save, get rid of that. S-save this one and then move here and save both of those.
1 : But I c-
3 : She yeah
1 : I think that's what I was gonna do to (--) like real (honest)
1 : So I'm gonna move here. Do what you said.
4 : Nn Then save both of them
2 : No
1 : Yeah because we've already lost a lot of stuff.
1 : And that's the closest I could get to because I can't
1 : Get the (--)
3 : Right
4 : Yeah that's fair
1 : And then I'm done cause I have my three actions so can I have two treasure cards, please?
1 : I have a Helicopter Lift that works, not another flooding one.
4 : Alright good.
1 : And I got this one.
1 : And now I have
1 : The um.
4 : You don't have to do anything.
1 : One two three
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah I only have five so I'm cool so
1 : You can go now
2 : ok I'll
2 : give
4 : Yeah give me that ah so now I can capture that. You're gonna want to use at least one of those. So that you don't have to go discard something.
2 : (Lost)
2 : Ok so how do we use
4 : Um so
4 : But we don't have anything to Sand, well we can sandbag this. Does it have to be the same?
2 : This
3 : Sandbag this one
2 : Does it have to be near me?
4 : Ah let me look.
4 : Do, do, do, do, do Flood Cards
4 : What's it say up there? I can't see behind me so
3 : Sandbag
2 : Um
3 : Ssss, ch, ch, ch
4 : Any one tile. So you don't have to
4 : so you can just shore up that which is a good idea cause it is a special one.
2 : Then
2 : This goes in here and
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Then you still have one more right? Where are you at?
2 : Yeah um
4 : You're eventually gonna get red so maybe move right here
4 : Wait no who are you? You're this?
2 : Ah I'm going
4 : Yeah I think cause you're the gray right?
4 : You're eventually gonna get the red treasure cause you have two.
2 : Mmhmm.
2 : So should I just move to Cliffs of
4 : Yeah you can just move there for now.
2 : mm.
3 : Ok
2 : And that's it.
4 : Let's hope it's not a Water's Rise.
2 : Ah I got
2 : two
4 : There it is. Ok that's good. So you're gonna eve- You're gonna save that. Um I'm gonna get this so then next turn we'll have two with
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ok.
4 : Four
2 : Ok
4 : You need one of these
3 : Three of them
2 : I'm it's the Temple of the Moon and Temple of
4 : That was a smart move
2 : The Sun
3 : You need
4 : Ok that's dangerous.
4 : Um if we lose both of those
4 : Ah we're gonna be in a prob- no but we're gonna be hard pressed. Cause we can get three out of four and win.
2 : We lost all guys
3 : Ok so
1 : (could we)
3 : Should
3 : She pulls one more cause she needs a three
2 : Oh yeah
4 : Yeah pull one more.
2 : I forgot
2 : Ah
4 : Cliffs of a Abandon
2 : This was in (--)
4 : Ok that's ok.
4 : That's alright.
3 : Ok now what do we need to do here.
4 : You
4 : Um
3 : I need to get this
4 : She's gonna get red, I'm getting this
2 : You
3 : I need to get these
2 : do you
2 : You probably
1 : Well guess what I have a Helicopter lift so eventually I could get next to you
3 : to her
2 : You probably shouldn't give me your red though because I already have five things so I have to discard
1 : too
4 : yeah so we're focusing on on her now
3 : Right
2 : Yeah
4 : She can't accept anything else except to get rid of
1 : no
4 : Ah
4 : Earth
3 : Well we only need three pieces right? So
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah I've got one, two.
1 : Correct
2 : One, two, so if she collects all of them
1 : Oh I got two
4 : Focus on these, cause we might lose both of these
2 : So
2 : Because if she collects all the blue
1 : Uh yeah we get that one
2 : Then she can discarde both
2 : The purple, gray and then that would work
1 : Yeah cause
4 : Nnmm
1 : I can
1 : That that's actually what I was thinking too (--)
4 : Either way um, you can either
4 : Like leave and then come back to mine
4 : Cause I want to give you
4 : I think I want to give you this
1 : Thank you
3 : Ok
1 : I do have a Helicopter Lift if
1 : you know we'll see what happens but if we want to do that one
4 : Yeah
4 : We might need that at the end
1 : Yeah
1 : so we could save it (too)
4 : One of you has save it
2 : Sh-she has a Helicopter Lift
3 : Wait a minute
4 : Either way you don't need these if you don't wanna do anything. You discard them, they're not important
4 : anymore for you
3 : Ch, ch
3 : If I fly
3 : to her
3 : and I can give her one of these, she gots three of these. She can discard
1 : yeah this is use once
3 : One of those
2 : Well y-
1 : totally it's what I would do
2 : Yeah
3 : Right.
4 : And then what you could actually do
4 : give it to her and you could fly both of you
3 : Right. Because of the Helicopter.
1 : That's smart cause I can't do that name$$$~21:37:80
4 : To there and then
4 : And then she has three
2 : I think
3 : Alright
2 : Can't you only fly once a turn?
3 : Well
4 : Actually no don't fly there, fly here.
1 : Um
1 : Yeah do you want to fly me there?
4 : Cause then I can get down there and give her this.
3 : Right.
3 : Cause I can f-
3 : I can fly because I'm the pilot
4 : One
1 : and I can't cause if we
3 : One, that's one (--) move
4 : Just hold on
3 : (--) move two so I give her that and this is discarded.
1 : And then I want to get rid of that yeah
1 : Ok that makes sense
3 : Ok and now (--) move three is I use
3 : The Helicopter and I fly
4 : (Well you can) discard that right there.
1 : Cool
3 : The two of us
1 : Cool
3 : There
1 : Thank you.
4 : Ok so now
3 : Ok
4 : We're at if you get those two
4 : I on my turn, I'm gonna instantly grab this
3 : Ok
4 : Then I'm going to move down and give you this
1 : Thank you
4 : You'll finish that
1 : And get rid of that one, cool
4 : And then on your turn
1 : Makes sense
3 : Ok
4 : You need no you need to then you on your turn you need to use your Helicopter Lift to get her
1 : To get us out of
1 : Oh I will
4 : to red
1 : That makes sense
4 : And then you can just finish that off, cause you're- or you could just move there on your turn.
2 : Yeah
4 : That's gonna be like, we might need that to save us all.
3 : Now
3 : Here's the hard part. We gotta pull three.
1 : Yeah to get over here.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Hmm
3 : Right
4 : We might lose both of these. Like we'll see what happens. I don't know.
2 : Well
3 : So this is where
4 : We have to be really careful. What did you lose
1 : Yeah
3 : Silver Gate
2 : Tidal Palace
3 : Tidal Palace
4 : what else?
3 : And
4 : Breakers
3 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : K
3 : Ok so we're still good.
4 : Ok
4 : Yee
2 : For now
4 : For now, ok my turn so
3 : Now it's your turn
4 : Capturing a treasure
4 : Ah I'll take that
4 : Now I'm gonna move down here.
1 : Cool
4 : Give you that. Get rid of that
1 : And then I will, I'm gonna just, can you do me a favor and discard that? Thank you.
4 : Um and that's all. That's all three of mine. By moving and then giving.
1 : Cool
1 : Cool
4 : Ah
3 : And now you get two of these
4 : We're actually on the same for all of us
1 : So now you got that
4 : Yeah we don't need.
4 : Ok so now you have four right?
1 : Yeah got all four of these
2 : Yeah so trade
3 : Ok
1 : I got five, I got the Helicopter
4 : Ok well first I need to, I need to do
3 : three? right. you need to do three.
2 : Oh yeah
3 : That's
4 : You shouldn't lose anything.
4 : Cause
3 : Right.
4 : The ones (--) are all down there.
2 : Hmmm.
4 : Ah Bronze Gate
4 : Cave of Shadows. It's (--) (risky)
4 : Dunes of Deception
4 : There it is
3 : mmhmm.
4 : Ok now this is a very critical move now. Now really think about this.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : I think
2 : She could
4 : Well she needs to gather the treasure right away
2 : Yeah she needs to gather the treasure right away and then
1 : Yeah
2 : She could
2 : t-
2 : No
4 : Who, what color are you?
2 : Gray so I'm in
1 : yeah
1 : Yeah I agree you should gather the treasure because everything's flood now.
4 : Ok let me calculate this
3 : Ok
4 : one two one two one two (--)
4 : Ok
4 : Here's what I think we should do
1 : Sounds good
4 : So if she gathers that treasure which is the first thing we should do so
1 : Yeah I agree let's gather the treasure.
4 : Get rid of yours
4 : She she has that Helicopter. She could actually fly us all.
4 : At least all three of us to here.
1 : I want to
4 : And then with that
4 : She still has well that
4 : She has one ac
4 : like she'll have one action left. Actually it doesn't even count as an action.
3 : Well right and she can flip two of them over.
4 : She can fly here
1 : Yeah
4 : and then save at least save this one, cause that's where you're gonna go
1 : and then we'll put
1 : Honestly I was
2 : Mmhm.
3 : Right.
1 : thinking that on my own.
3 : Ok
4 : cause then.
4 : When you're there
3 : Ok so
4 : You can gather this and then you're right here and then all we need to do
1 : Yeah
3 : Er
2 : Is good
4 : We have three treasures and we can leave. But we need to get a Helicopter.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok so that's flat
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
4 : To get there
1 : Ok
4 : So you're gonna come here
4 : Take that and then come here and then all we need is one of us to get a Helicopter and we can ga- and we can win
1 : Cool
2 : Ok
1 : So I can draw my two treasure cards, that that was very smart.
1 : So
1 : Flip this over.
1 : I have a pro
4 : Hold up. What?
1 : I have Helicopter Lift again but I have a
3 : She flipped
3 : Ok
1 : what
4 : For what? oh she meant no I don't think mean to do, just this one.
3 : Mm right, right we flipped that one.
1 : No
1 : Yeah there
4 : Ahh
1 : I have a Helicopter Lift but I have a problem. I got a Water's Rise card.
2 : Well
4 : That's ok. it's ok.
1 : So now we know
3 : And she has the Helicopter.
4 : As long as you don't lose Fool's Landing. You can't, sh- this can't be gone before she gets there so that's not a big deal. Um.
1 : But I have Helicopter.
1 : I know.
1 : But there is a Water's Rise card here unfortunately so
4 : Ok
1 : Sorry guys.
2 : So mm
4 : (--) all back together
3 : Ok
1 : So it's
3 : hmm
1 : phantom Garden yeah can you
4 : Over there
2 : Yeah
3 : Water rise goes back in here. So f- right shuffle this
1 : Sorry
4 : We're gonna win this yet.
1 : Sorry
1 : One two
4 : K how do we
1 : Sorry guys I always forget the Helicopter.
4 : Doesn't matter. Doesnt matter.
2 : And then
3 : Ok and three cards
4 : Gave
4 : gave her three.
2 : three cards
2 : One, two
1 : Hmm
4 : We can't lose caves anymore so it doesn't matter.
1 : I know.
4 : We just can't
4 : Even if you
1 : Thank you. Ok guys.
4 : I actually kinda want this gone we lose that
1 : Um
1 : We have Temple of the sun, Temple of the Moon
4 : yeah
1 : And Criminal
4 : That's what I expected.
1 : Forest so
4 : That's exactly what I expected and what else? Crimson Forest?
1 : Crimina
1 : I expected the same thing. Oh Crimson Forest
2 : What is that?
4 : That should. That should have already, That should have already been in here.
1 : I think
4 : Ah draw another one. That was supposed to be over here.
1 : Oh
4 : We lost that one already. That's what I wanted to happen. Ok.
2 : Cliffs
1 : Ok
1 : I
4 : Perfect
1 : think
1 : that
1 : Yeah
1 : think that (--)
4 : Yeah so now, you don't have to even move.
2 : Ok
1 : Cool.
4 : Instantly gather that
2 : Ok
4 : Come to us
4 : Now we're all here.
4 : So now
4 : We have all, we have three out of the four
4 : We have all of the qualifications to win
1 : We got a Helicopter
3 : And I can pass
4 : And all we need
2 : We just need
4 : All we need now is for you we need someone we just need to either
4 : Like we just need to survive until we get here
1 : Yeah
4 : Um
2 : Oh
4 : Well that's really it because you don't, none of us have a Helicopter
3 : Right
1 : But I got one.
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah (that's what I'm) saying you all have one.
3 : So this is where we have to survive.
1 : Yeah
2 : mom sorry
4 : Yeah we have to just survive right now for
2 : Just let me pick
4 : Survive for you know, one more way around.
3 : Oh your turn ok.
1 : Ok.
4 : Cool.
3 : Hmm
3 : And then
4 : As long as Fool's Landing doesn't come up
4 : So as long as we don't draw Fool's landing, then someone gets a Water's Rise and Draw Fools' Landing again
1 : ok
4 : What'd you get
2 : Oh Silver Gate
4 : Irrelevant
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Tidal Palace.
1 : Ok given that (--)
4 : Cool.
4 : Alrigth, well we're not going anywhere.
1 : because (--)
3 : Ok
4 : Ah
4 : Yeah these are all gone now.
2 : (--)
1 : Ok
4 : Ok we're, we're fine.
3 : Ok and then.
1 : (but at least we're alive)
4 : Yeah we're still alive.
3 : I go this way.
1 : I got a Helicopter Lift so.
4 : It's statistically really improbable right now to draw that and then
1 : yeah
4 : get a Water's rise and then draw it again.
1 : That's
1 : True but sometimes things happen but you still get the Helciopter lift
2 : What did you get?
4 : yeah take in that
2 : Oh well
4 : Survive
4 : Just survive.
1 : Yeah (--)
3 : Three cards.
4 : Just hope nothing happens
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok we've got Cave of the Shadows
4 : Nope.
2 : um
4 : Ah Dunes of Deception gone.
1 : Ok
4 : Bronze Gate gone. Alright.
1 : Ok
4 : Alright team. We're almost there.
1 : Ok.
2 : Almost there.
4 : What'd you get?
4 : That, that's
3 : No I'm done.
4 : I I I I didn't move yet so.
3 : Ok
4 : I'm I'm just
4 : I'm
4 : I'm done
1 : Ok
4 : So here now take yeah I'm done
3 : Right, but yeah. You have to take these.
1 : Where?
1 : If he's done
1 : But I got a Helicopter Lift
4 : Ah
2 : And ok, and these are your
4 : Yeah so on your turn, we're gonna- we're gonna win
3 : Ok three
1 : Ah
4 : What?
2 : Three things now. Fool's Landing.
3 : Three
4 : Ok we we won cause it's impossible
1 : Well guess what?
3 : Misty Marsh
4 : for
1 : We have a
3 : Right
1 : Well we got a Helicopter Lift so we can leave.
4 : We win.
1 : So guess what.
2 : Yeah.
1 : We're leavin'.
1 : If that's cool you guys (--)
4 : Nope.
4 : No
4 : I won.
1 : We won
3 : We're done.
1 : Let's
1 : We're f-
1 : Ok so now somebody, somebody techinically follow the rules while (--).

1 : Um
1 : I'm thinking
1 : should probably
1 : um
1 : unflood
1 : two of the tiles
1 : um
1 : prob-
2 : Probably do the one that has the thing on it
1 : Mhmm
1 : So I'll do Whispering Garden
1 : and Gold Gate
1 : So that's one action
1 : and I have fire cards so I think I'm gonna start moving that way
2 : I think allowed- you're only allowed to shore up one
1 : Oh I have to be adjacent to it
1 : Ok
2 : Can you do two?
2 : Er
3 : She can
2 : Oh, ok
3 : Because she's the Engineer
1 : I can. I just have to be
2 : Oh, you can. Alright.
3 : It's just the matter of the cards she
3 : shores up need to be next to her
2 : Yeah
1 : Adjacent, ok
1 : I'll do that then
1 : and then
1 : can move
1 : say I wanna get down there
1 : so probably move
1 : this way and then
1 : I have one more action so
1 : this way
1 : guess I'll go
1 : um
1 : hand me two treasure deck
1 : ok
1 : Um so a Waters Rise card
1 : and
1 : put that over there, please
1 : and then flood cards
1 : Oh
1 : there
1 : and Whispering Garden
2 : So
2 : I guess I'll start
2 : by
2 : shoring up
2 : move here first
2 : and then I can
2 : No wait, never mind. I'll just do that
2 : Uh
2 : see
2 : Uh
2 : I guess I'll move here
2 : uh
2 : oh
2 : I don't have anything else to do
2 : I suppose
3 : You have to do flood cards
3 : Or treasure cards and flood cards, yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Mhm
2 : Another one of those
2 : and
2 : I can shore up
2 : Uh
2 : I don't know. I guess I can save that.
2 : But
1 : Ok
2 : Oh
3 : You should shore- you should shore up that one before you have to flood it.
2 : Where is that?
1 : Cities of abandon
2 : Which one? The cities of abandon?
3 : The cliffs, yeah.
2 : Oh ok.
2 : Cliffs, yeah
2 : So then this goes here
1 : I don't think you can do that because this card, like, it was drawn so I think you would've had to do that before
3 : Oh I didn't know if you could do that
2 : Oh so it's just
2 : done
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Sure
2 : So that's out
2 : and
2 : I'll just go here
1 : Mhmm
2 : Ok
2 : That's it
3 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : I will just move
3 : and
3 : with my thing I can
3 : go to any tile so it's not just-
2 : Yeah
1 : Mm
3 : I know that I have one here so I'll just hang out here for a bit
3 : to accumulate them
1 : I was thinking maybe you should
3 : Or, yeah
1 : go here
1 : and then you could flip
3 : Oh ok, yeah
1 : that for one of your actions
3 : could do that
3 : um
1 : Or, like, the Watchtower
3 : yeah
2 : Because you can
1 : because if you go down to the Watchtower
2 : then you can flip an adjacent one
2 : you mean?
1 : Mm
3 : Oh, yeah, yeah. That's fine
2 : And then you could still be there closely
1 : Yeah
3 : Sure
3 : Ok
3 : Uh
3 : right
3 : and that's
3 : two
3 : alright so more helicoptors
3 : and that
3 : um
3 : and then flood
1 : Flood cards
3 : So we have
3 : Oh, good thinking
3 : and
3 : rock
3 : Pretty much. Oh, we already, so this one's out
2 : What does it mean when they have these little pieces on them?
1 : I think that's just where we started
3 : Yeah, I think it's the starting point
2 : Oh, oh
1 : Like the pawn start
3 : And so this goes back
1 : Mhmm
1 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : So
1 : I should
1 : probably get down
1 : to the
2 : Yeah
1 : Cave of Shadows
1 : because I can't
1 : um
1 : shore up anything, really
1 : um
2 : Can you
3 : I can use the helicopter
3 : to get you there
1 : Oh later
3 : Right
3 : isn't it
1 : Is that what you mean?
3 : Or now
2 : Can you give her this or is that only something that I can do?
1 : No she can but it has to be on her turn
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : So I guess
3 : Yeah like, like I
3 : If you wanted to get there I can give this to you on my turn
1 : Ok
1 : Well I was just thinking for like my one turn I could give
1 : her the
1 : Chalice
2 : Chalice
3 : Ok
1 : Or, wait, where's the
1 : the one
3 : Purple is either above or below
1 : Hm
1 : Ok so I guess it's close so I was gonna say because the fire's here and the Chalice so I can
3 : Mhmm
1 : give this to you
1 : And then
2 : And what are you, are you going to move to here then? And she can give you that on her turn?
1 : Mhmm
2 : Oh ok
1 : Yep
2 : Give a single card to another player
1 : Oh who is standing on the same tile as you. Ok, never mind.
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : Oh, I have a trip to get there
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : If
1 : What color are, is this you?
2 : that were the case
3 : Mhm
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok so
1 : Then maybe on
1 : your turn
1 : you can fly down and then
1 : can you, like
1 : give card
2 : I can
2 : Me? I can give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card
2 : Which I don't know what that means. One action per card
1 : Yeah
3 : So it's just like a one to one thing. Like one of your actions will be doing that exchange
2 : Ok
2 : So that's an action
1 : Mhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : Wait so you're trying to get to here. You can just
3 : go here
1 : Yeah I was gonna give her a tile. I was just thinking
3 : Oh ok
1 : the best way to do
1 : I'll just go
1 : because
1 : you have
1 : a card that I need and which, this is you right?
3 : Yeah, so I could, yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Come over and do that. So I'll do that and then
3 : I can, yeah
3 : Mhmm
1 : Yeah, I guess we'll just do that
1 : Does that sound good? 'Cause there's really no point in me doing anything else
2 : Ok
3 : Mhmm
2 : Yeah, i agree
3 : Yep
3 : That's fine
1 : Ok
2 : Oh dang. Nice
1 : Oh
1 : great
3 : Here we go
2 : Oh
3 : Yeah, I know right
2 : Next two turns
1 : Ok, Temple of the Moon, oh
1 : Iron Gate
2 : That's gold
2 : Oh, Iron Gate
3 : Ok
3 : At least it's on the periphery
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : Alright
2 : Alight, yeah
2 : So, now
2 : I'm like so far away
2 : aAnd, I mean I guess I can
1 : Ee
2 : If I can move up there then I can flip that back over, like eventually
3 : Mhmm
1 : Mhmm
3 : You just might need to take like
2 : Um
3 : Two or three turns to do that
2 : Yeah
2 : 'Cause I can only move once at a time
1 : Oh
1 : Ok, maybe you could
1 : give the
1 : Chalice to me because I'll be
1 : close here
3 : Mhmm
2 : If the next one like
2 : comes up, you mean?
3 : But you
3 : But again, you have to be on the same tile to give the cards, remember?
2 : Oh right
3 : Or no you do, you don't, you don't have to
2 : No but I can give it to anyone
1 : Oh
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, ok
1 : So we could do that, and then
1 : we should probably because we're gonna have to
2 : I mean I'm gonna have to start moving anyway. It might as well be sooner rather than later because I'm stuck here like
3 : Mhmm
3 : And you can only, yeah
1 : Hm
1 : Oh, so I have to discard one, ok
2 : Oh you have to discard
2 : Well
2 : You can discard that one because you don't have anything accumulated
3 : Yeah
3 : Mhmm
1 : Ok
2 : Where does that go?
3 : It goes in the treasure pile
2 : Ok
1 : Treasure pile
3 : Thank you
2 : Do these never come back though?
3 : If we like run through the deck I think we'll re-shuffle it or something but yeah
2 : Ok, also it doesn't matter because you have treasure cards anyway
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : Yeah, 'cause I'm cornered
3 : Mhm
2 : So I have to
3 : Yeah and remember this is a diagonal. You can't move diagonally
2 : Start
2 : Right, I have to start moving anyway
3 : So
3 : yeah
2 : So that's one
1 : So that's one
2 : that was two
1 : You have
2 : and then, I can
1 : up to three
2 : I don't have anything else to do, I suppose
1 : Maybe you could use the sandbag card to save this just in case we ahve to
3 : Mm
3 : Yeah
2 : Because
3 : I think that would be really wise
2 : It has a thing on t, ok
1 : Yeah, shuffle and it comes up again
3 : And that's why, you're going toward that anyway, yeah
2 : Good idea
3 : So
2 : Ok
2 : Ok, cool
3 : Alright, so treasures and water
2 : Ok, Waters Rise
3 : Uh
2 : Oh
2 : Do I put these on top?
2 : And
1 : Mm
3 : And then you have to draw three of them, yeah
2 : And I have to pick three
1 : Three
2 : Ok
2 : So this
2 : didn't do anything
3 : --
2 : But I guess it did, because it would have been sunk
1 : Right
3 : Yeah, that's tru
2 : Um
2 : Iron Gate
1 : Iron gate is sunk
3 : -- just goes away
3 : oh give me the card
2 : Done
3 : for the
3 : Iron Gate, yeah
2 : Oh, my bad, yeah
1 : Mm
2 : And the Gold Gate
1 : Golden Gate is sunk
2 : Alright
2 : And this goes
1 : Mhm
2 : This is mine? Alright
2 : --
3 : Ok
3 : So um, you needed or someone needed to be lifted
3 : Who was that?
3 : No
1 : I don't hink were gonna do that. I think you were gonna give me the fire card
3 : Not anymore, yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : As one
2 : Ok
2 : Right
1 : Right and then
3 : And well, I, I needed to be over here to do that
2 : You have to discard one
1 : Ok
3 : Here I needed to be over here to do that, too, but here
3 : Oh
2 : Give a single card to another player stading on the same
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh same
3 : I just, I just moved
1 : Oh ok
3 : So that's fine
2 : Ok, but you still have to discard
1 : And then
1 : Yeah
1 : Get rid of that
3 : Um, let's see
2 : Uh
3 : Really
3 : Do you need to go anywhere?
2 : Is there anything that you can do?
2 : I mean
3 : 'Cause I already have another one of these cards, I guess
3 : Um
2 : Like I only have two of these right now anyway so
3 : Mm
2 : I don't think that that would help much
1 : Yeah because like on your next turn even you could just move over and then
2 : Yeah, like, might as well save those if you need 'em so you could just continue with
1 : Unsink it
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Cool
3 : Alright
3 : Uh
2 : Picking I guess
3 : I think that's all I need to
1 : Treasure card
3 : do in this round
3 : So I've got
3 : this. I think that's six
3 : So I will
2 : Well
3 : Discard one of the heli-
3 : 'cause it's just two of 'em
2 : Yeah
3 : Um and then
3 : floods
3 : so three
3 : Alright so we have
3 : where's
3 : Howling Garden
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : It sunk
3 : Ok
3 : and Whispering Garden
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : These go back
1 : Ok
1 : So I wanna get
1 : treasure first. I can just do that
2 : You need to trade 'em
3 : Yeah
1 : right now
2 : Mhm
3 : These cards just go back in the pile I guess
1 : And I just take this
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Um
2 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : I can move over and then unsink that
2 : So you're here
1 : Think I'll just do that
1 : then
1 : Oops, can you flip that please?
3 : Mhm
1 : Ok
1 : Um can you hand me a treasure card?
1 : Ok
1 : Um and then
1 : flood cards
2 : Right so we have four of these up now
2 : so
2 : I guess
2 : on
2 : your guys's next turn see
3 : We need to consolidate
2 : give 'em to me and
3 : Yeah
1 : Mm
2 : then you could
2 : maybe
2 : ok I mean
2 : Maybe on your next turn you could first fly me to like one of the oh, well I guess that's right there but
3 : Mhm
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : So I'll, I'll move here next and then I can move there and collect it
1 : Because we're gonna have to
3 : Mm
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah we're going to have to un
1 : flip this too, at some point
2 : Yeah, and that one
3 : And, and that. Yeah
1 : Mhm
3 : I mean I can use a sandbags to do that so
2 : And you have sandbags
1 : Ok, where's crimson f-
1 : Forest is up there
3 : Ok
1 : Crimson Forest, Copper Gate
1 : and Cave of Embers
1 : Which isn't really important
2 : Ok
2 : Good
1 : Mhm
3 : Ok
2 : So I'm moving here
2 : Um
2 : I guess I'm
2 : gonna shore up this
3 : Mhm
1 : Oh wait
1 : before you do that
2 : Yeah
1 : Maybe you should like, shore up this one and then move over and then shore up
1 : Or did you, were you going to do something else?
2 : Can I do that?
3 : Wait, I think you, like one move is like one
1 : I think so
3 : action so you can only do three actions, right?
1 : Yeah, 'cause like
2 : So I can, this would become my first
1 : Flipping that would be one
1 : and then over
2 : two
3 : Mm
3 : Three
2 : three
1 : Three
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : That was good
2 : Uh
1 : Yeah
2 : Now
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : Waters Rise
2 : That's not really
3 : And then
1 : Three flood cards
2 : important
2 : anymore
2 : Ok, so we have Copper Gate sunk
3 : That's done
2 : Whispering Garden
2 : done
2 : Howling Garden
2 : cool
3 : Can you give me the Copper Gate card?
2 : So, it's your turn
3 : Ok
3 : Um
2 : So now you wanna give me one of these
3 : Did
3 : yes
1 : So you have to fly to here
2 : Oh right
1 : Right
3 : Ojh
3 : Yeah
2 : Does sh-
1 : You have to be on the same
2 : she has to be on the same
1 : Or is your special power
3 : Or
1 : you can give them to anyone
1 : --
2 : No, that's mie=ne
1 : Ok
2 : You're right. So she's gotta
2 : fly to me
3 : Ok, so I have to go here
3 : Er, yeah
3 : And then give you this
2 : Is that
1 : Give that to you
2 : uh an action for you
3 : Um
2 : to fly anywhere?
3 : Yes it is an action. So that's one, two
2 : Ok
2 : So that's two
1 : Two
3 : and then
3 : Three is
2 : Um
1 : You should
3 : Yeah
2 : You can't flip over a diagonal, can you? You can't shore up a diagonal?
3 : I can use sand
1 : Oh
3 : Um
3 : But this is any one, any tile, for sandbags
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah, maye you should
1 : shore up
1 : either this one or that one
2 : Yeah, either or
1 : But
1 : I'm thinking this one is kind of
1 : going to be iso-
2 : I was just about to say the same thing. I think you should do this one
1 : It's
1 : Yeah, isolated
3 : Yeah
3 : Mhm
2 : 'Cause we've gotta keep these guys in play anyway
3 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : Mm yeah, Fool's Landing
3 : Alright so there's my three
2 : Cool
3 : More helicopters
1 : Did you discard sandbag?
3 : Uh
3 : yes
1 : Ok
3 : Um
1 : and
3 : And then three
2 : Alright
2 : So
3 : Cave is done
1 : Ok, that's ok
3 : We've already got that one
3 : And forest, where's the Crimson Forest?
3 : Ah, crimson is also done
3 : Ok
2 : Oh so we're
2 : stranded, basically
3 : Little bit
1 : You can fly someone else with you, right?
3 : Yes
2 : Yeah, 'cause, especially 'cause, yeah
1 : Ok
1 : As long as you're on
2 : On the same
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : So
3 : Just this
3 : can't sink
2 : So you need to give me this
1 : Ok
1 : Oh
2 : as one of 'em
2 : Oh well you can shore up the temple right now
1 : No I have to be adjacent to it
1 : I can
2 : Aren't you, oh you're red. Oh, my bad. I thought you were blue
1 : shore up two, yeah
3 : Yeah, she's red. Yeah
3 : yeah
1 : I can't give that to you because
2 : Ok
3 : Mhm
1 : I have to like
2 : Yeah
1 : be up with you
3 : Mhm
2 : Yeah
2 : Well
1 : Um
2 : Oh, and she can't fly
2 : Um
1 : Is there anything
2 : Shoot
1 : Um I'll probably
1 : just like move on to the
1 : Coral Palace so I'm
1 : there
1 : I think
2 : Can you move diagonal?
1 : Yeah, well just like one, two
2 : Oh
1 : And
2 : I thought you could only do one space, though
1 : I think, isn't it
2 : One space per action
1 : Yeah so that would be two actions
3 : Oh
2 : Ok
3 : You just moved up, two actions, yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : and
1 : I can only shore up adjacent, I can't shore up diagonal.
1 : So I think that's probably
2 : Oh dang
1 : Oh great.
2 : That was
1 : Look at that.
2 : Cool
3 : Cool
3 : Can you just get that now or is that one of your actions to get the treasure- yeah, ok.
2 : That's another action.
1 : Yeah that's a
1 : I have to wait till
3 : Oh yeah, now you know. Next
1 : next
1 : hopefully.
1 : Oh boy
1 : Ok
1 : Coral Palace
3 : Oh
3 : Mm
1 : Dune of Deception
1 : and Silver Gate.
3 : Ok
3 : um
2 : Ok
1 : It's your turn
3 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : it's my turn.
2 : Um, (--) shore up this.
1 : Mm good call
3 : Yes
3 : Um
2 : And I'm- Well I don't really
2 : Let me think
2 : I don't have to be on that tile to collect the treasure there, do I?
3 : I think you do, yeah.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so I might as well move.
3 : Yup
2 : And
2 : uh
3 : And I'll move with you on my turn so we can Helicopter out.
3 : (--)
2 : Yeah
3 : Cause we can't go.
2 : Is there any reason that we need to like
2 : keep the Silver Gate?
1 : No because you're
3 : Uh
2 : (--)
3 : Yeah
1 : stranded anyway.
2 : Yeah because that's an island.
3 : Yeah
1 : Well I was thinking
2 : Well who can move diagonal?
3 : No one
2 : Oh
1 : None of us- No
2 : cause we're not that guy.
3 : We're not playing the Explorer, yeah.
1 : Wait because on your turn
1 : Oh wait
3 : On my turn we're gonna go somewhere else.
1 : Yeah I was gonna say
1 : because I have to
1 : give her this card at some point.
2 : Yeah so on her turn she needs to fly you
2 : to me.
1 : But I have to be here to get
1 : that.
1 : Unless
2 : Oh
1 : On your turn you could fly
3 : Everyone to the chalice thing?
2 : No cause we're on, on different places.
1 : You could fly to get
3 : Oh
1 : Oh wait, no
1 : because that would be one,
3 : What I could do is I could move me, on
1 : two,
3 : fly over
1 : three.
3 : Yeah
1 : Because you could fly to me, take me there, and then take me
3 : Mmhmm
1 : back.
2 : Take all of us back, you mean.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : Yup, yup, that could work.
2 : Ok
1 : Well no you would have to stay there.
2 : She- Well she could move here
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Well wait how am I getting the thing then?
1 : Yeah I was gonna say like she could come down, get me, take me up
3 : Yeah
1 : so I can give you this card
1 : and then
1 : take me back so I can get the
2 : But can't you just give me that card on your turn- Ah but then your turn will be next but then she couldn't
1 : Coral palace.
2 : fly you back, becausse can't you only give me
3 : MM
2 : that card when it's your turn?
1 : No we have to be on the same
3 : Mmhmm
1 : tile.
3 : You can give cards anywhere on your turn but she can't give to you.
2 : Yeah but like
2 : Yeah but like I'm saying don't you have to wait to give me
2 : that card until it's your turn, or can you give it at
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So like
3 : Yeah
1 : No
2 : she's gonna fly you
1 : Oh, I see what you're saying.
2 : here and then you're not gonna be able to do anything.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok, yeah we'll just have to wait then, so you can get that, because it's gonna sink.
2 : So the only thing that we can do is just keep em from sinking until we go around again.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So
3 : Yup
3 : Can you shore up the tile you're on, not just an adjacent one, or
3 : Ok
1 : I think you can shore up the tile you're on.
2 : Yeah you can.
2 : So
3 : That might be a good
2 : yeah
2 : so
2 : you're next turn, you're gonna give
2 : me that
1 : I'm
2 : and then it'll be
2 : your-
2 : and then I can
2 : get it and then
2 : her turn will be again and then you could-
2 : we could get you for- (--) that
3 : Well on her turn she can also do this. If she gives you that card she can also get the treasure on her turn.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : So she doesn't need to stay on this tile, necessarily.
1 : No I can
1 : shore it up
3 : Yeah
1 : and then- Yeah, because then
2 : And then- Oh cause you-
2 : And get it.
2 : I see.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : do you first
1 : Yeah
2 : because you're already there, you're like primed.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : It's still your turn right?
2 : Cool, yes.
1 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
2 : It's still my turn but I'm not doing anything more, I'm just gonna do this.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yup
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : and
1 : get rid of the
1 : chalice, cause you can only have five, yeah.
2 : Oh yeah, cause you already have four.
3 : Mmhmm yeah
2 : Alright
1 : And then
1 : water tiles.
2 : Temple of the Sun,
2 : Tidal Palace,
2 : Bronze Gate.
1 : Let's see here.
2 : That wasn't so bad,
2 : I suppose.
1 : Ok
1 : though I'm going
1 : to just go ahead and get the chalice
2 : Wait, it's her turn
1 : Oh sorry
3 : I do need to (--)
1 : I thought we were going this way.
3 : Um so I can move up here so we can Helicopter
3 : um that's the only thing I know for sure.
1 : Well
2 : Wait, no
3 : we don't need to Helicopter anymore, I guess.
1 : No
2 : You need to- If anything, you would need to Helicopter to her- go to her, so that she could Helicopter
2 : the two of you can come to me and give me this.
1 : Yeah
2 : So you wanna go here
3 : Ok
1 : Well first you should maybe
2 : if anything.
1 : shore up- Wait,
1 : because that would be
1 : one,
2 : Yeah, wait so you're standing here right now.
1 : two
2 : right?
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, ok, I'm trying to think. So you could like shore this up, would be one.
3 : And then two, and then three.
1 : Or move to it
1 : shore
1 : One
2 : Move to that and then shore this up, do you mean?
3 : But I don't need to, I don't need to shore it.
1 : Yeah
2 : Just in case
3 : Cause you still- We still need to get
3 : you guys together
1 : Yeah
3 : and I'm the only one can do that- who can do that.
1 : But I'm
1 : thinking if you move here and then shore this up
3 : Mmhmm
1 : that would be two and then
1 : you could fly to me.
2 : And then the third one to fly to you.
2 : Yeah
3 : But you two need to be together, not me and you, right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so you're coming to her so that you two can come
1 : but I have to get this on my turn.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Oh ok, yup, alright cool.
3 : So
1 : This one
2 : No, no, no, flip this
3 : Yeah
3 : Um
1 : And then you can fly to me
1 : That would be three.
3 : But you can't- I wasn't, I wasn't adjacent to that.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah but you moved here
1 : that's one turn.
3 : Ok
2 : and then you flupped this, that's two. And then fly to her
1 : Two
3 : Oh ok
1 : and then you can fly to me.
3 : Ok
2 : That's three
1 : Yeah
3 : Cool
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Ok so
3 : (--)
3 : (--)
3 : Um anyhow, I guess I needed to
3 : get rid of two because
1 : Yeah you can get rid of those two.
3 : Yeah
3 : So and then floods
2 : Oh we kinda played that wrong.
2 : Uh
1 : What did we do?
2 : I think it's too late to go back but
2 : I think she should've just come here to like
2 : flip that cause like
1 : Oh
2 : we could (be) screwed right now.
1 : Well I think it's, I think it's still in here.
2 : (--) there might be two.
2 : Ok well we're good.
3 : Alright
2 : (--) that
1 : Um
2 : I think right?
2 : Yeah, cool
3 : So
3 : Over- Where's Watchtower? I think Watchtower's (--). No it's not.
3 : And then
3 : Marsh.
3 : K, that was kinda safe.
2 : K
1 : Ok
1 : so your Helicopter
1 : the Lift, you can
1 : either fly like a whole group of people if you're on the same tile
1 : or you could just like
1 : use it to fly one person somewhere, right?
3 : Um
1 : Like
2 : Does she-
2 : But she doesn't have to be with them. Used to fly one or more
1 : Yeah I think that
1 : Right?
2 : other adventureres who are on the same
3 : It just- Yeah, it just says
2 : (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : So you can fly yourself and others to the same tile.
1 : Ok
3 : So I could, I could like give this to someone to do, basically. Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : basically, yeah, ok.
3 : Yeah
1 : (--)
1 : then go ahead and do
1 : this, which is great. Ok so that's one turn.
1 : And then
1 : I can't give you this until my next turn
1 : so
2 : Wait, why?
3 : Because we're not on the same tile.
1 : Yeah, we have to be on the same tile.
2 : Oh my god, I keep forgetting that.
1 : Or you could use your Helicopter Lift
3 : Mmhmm
1 : right now to get me up there.
2 : To fly her
3 : Oh ok, I didn't know if I needed to use it on my turn.
1 : Oh
2 : Helicopter Lift
1 : you do have to
2 : Yes, that's what we were waiting for before.
3 : Yeah
1 : use it on your turn.
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : I
2 : So
1 : think that's all. Should I shore it up?
2 : Are you
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : I might as well just shore it up because I'm
1 : here because we don't need the other ones, and then
1 : that's probably
2 : Ok
1 : I have a Lift,
1 : Water Rise.
2 : No these ones
2 : go on top of that.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh
3 : And they all get shuffled in
2 : Yeah
3 : We
3 : pull three.
1 : Ok now I pull three.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yup
1 : Tidal Palace is sunk.
1 : Ok
2 : Well
2 : yeah, ok, never mind.
1 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Cause you're gonna have to fly me somewhere to get to the main land
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Yup
1 : Oh yeah, Misty Marsh.
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
2 : So
1 : You should probably shore that up
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : first.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
3 : And then
2 : Wait, what just happened with this?
1 : Well
1 : on
2 : Oh because you're not with me. Why do I keep forgetting that? I'm so dumb.
1 : her turn
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : I'm screwed
2 : so
2 : I can't do anything.
1 : Yeah
2 : Um, we don't need either of these
1 : Oh wait that,
1 : that flood tile goes here.
2 : Yeah
2 : (--) Observatory
2 : sunk.
2 : Watchtower sunk.
2 : And
2 : Bronze Gate
2 : is also sunk.
3 : Ee we (only deal) with Helicopters
3 : Ok
3 : So I am flying who where?
2 : Her to me
1 : The two of us to there.
3 : Mmkay
2 : Yeah
3 : So everyone, everyone goes here is what you're saying? Yeah ok
1 : Does that count as
1 : Yeah
1 : Does that count as- That's one action right?
1 : That's just one.
3 : Uh no
3 : the Helicopter doesn't count as an action
1 : Well, no, you can fly
1 : you can fly me, because that's your special power.
3 : Ye-
2 : You don't need to use that.
3 : Yeah, but this counts as an action, this doesn't.
2 : Is she allowed to take someone with her though?
3 : In this? Yeah
2 : No for this.
1 : Oh
3 : No.
1 : Well
2 : Oh
2 : one person- one per turn.
3 : This is just, this is just me, flying around.
1 : Oh ok
3 : So and that counts as an action for me but this doesn't, and the
1 : Ok, yeah, so we need to do that.
3 : Yeah.
3 : So
3 : that stays.
1 : Ok
3 : Um
2 : Wait, so you don't have to get rid of one of these now?
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh I, I do need to get rid of it, I just played it, yeah, ok.
2 : Yeah, ok, I just got confused.
1 : I think that's all we were going to do
3 : Yeah I think that's all that can happen right now.
1 : cause
2 : Yeah
1 : Unless you wanna fly-
1 : Wait ok, so we're not gonna need that tile, we're not gonna need this tile, we're not
1 : gonna really need this
3 : Mmhmm
1 : tile because
3 : And we only need three of these treasures right? And so we're gonna get that on her next turn cause you're gonna give that to her
1 : Mmhmm
3 : um and she'll be able to claim it
1 : Yeah
1 : Maybe
2 : Then that'll be the-
3 : and then we all just need to get back here.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok since maybe
2 : True
3 : So if we all hang tight, basically in this spot, we should be ok.
2 : And then you could fly us all together.
3 : Yeah
1 : But we need one of those cards to leave Fool's Landing.
2 : One of these cards?
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh
3 : Mm
1 : So maybe
3 : Yeah
2 : So she can only fly her
2 : herself there, I see.s
3 : Well what you- You have that. So what you can do
2 : Oh if she gets us all off here
1 : Mmhmm
3 : is you can fly us all, you can fly us all here. And then
2 : one of us can get us home.
1 : Yeah
3 : We- Well you can't do that yet, cause we still have to get her treasure.
1 : Yes
3 : So it would be like another two rounds and
3 : basically like crossing your fingers that nothing we need sinks.
3 : So
2 : Well, it would only be- So in the next
3 : Yeah
2 : Wait who's turn is it about to be?
2 : Yours?
1 : Mine.
3 : Yours
2 : Ok so
2 : you give me that
1 : Mmhmm, so that counts as one turn.
2 : Um
2 : oh right because we can't evaucate until I get the thing.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Yup
1 : Ok I see what you're saying.
3 : So
2 : So yeah.
3 : Alright, well let's
3 : Oh yeah, do I need treasures? Yeah.
1 : It's still her turn.
2 : Oh
2 : Gosh
3 : Yeah so I need- Yeah
2 : damn. Sorry.
3 : So, cool
3 : Alright yeah..
1 : You can get rid of the chalice.
3 : Three of those lovely, lovely things.
3 : So Moon, where's Moon? So Moon gets flipped.
1 : K
3 : Garden gets flipped and
3 : oh both Gardens get flipped.
1 : Oh
3 : Alright
3 : so
3 : and back.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : so
3 : your turn.
2 : Make that move
3 : Purple goes
1 : My turn, I'm giving this to you
2 : Mmhmm
1 : and then
3 : You should shore up here, so we don't all sink
2 : I have to discard this.
3 : with nowhere to go.
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh, yeah
2 : Oh actually it doesn't matter if I get this, it'll be the third
3 : Yeah cause we already- We'll have three. Yeah
1 : Yeah, ok, I was thinking maybe
1 : instead of shoring that up
1 : because I can't really- it's
2 : Is it in here?
3 : not gonna sink
1 : Yeah, it's on the top. So it's not gonna
2 : Oh Temple of the Moon.
1 : It's not going to sink because I would have to like shuffle them, put them on top. Cause I do that
2 : Unless you get a Water
3 : Yeah it's possible that you could get a Water Rise card and have to do that.
2 : And then have it be on top?
1 : Do you shuffle it first and then
3 : Yeah, you shuffle them and then you put em all on top.
2 : And then put it on top and then
1 : pull it?
1 : Ok so
2 : So it's kinda risky.
3 : So, I would, I would shore it up.
2 : Why wouldn't you flip it?
1 : Well I was thinking
1 : because these are
1 : both at risk to sink.
1 : I could- Well no
2 : These you mean?
2 : Like what are?
1 : These two which are- We have to have those to get the
2 : But we don't need that third one if we-
2 : Or that fourth one if we get the third.
3 : Yeah, we only need three treasures. So we, we just need to get back here, we just need to get back here.
1 : Oh, we only need three, ok.
2 : Yeah, so
1 : So yeah, then I'll just shore this up
2 : Shore it
3 : Yeah
1 : and then
1 : that's it.
3 : Alright
2 : Ok
2 : Ok well
1 : Ok and then
1 : three so, Silver Gate, sunk.
1 : Dunes of Deception is sunk.
1 : Coral Palace is flipped.
2 : Cool
3 : Alright so you keep your Helicopter card,
3 : I'll move us all here
3 : and then
3 : you take off.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : That's how we win.
1 : Ok
2 : So I'm gonna take this baby
3 : Alright, cool.
2 : and I'm not going to do anything else.
1 : You have to treasure cards.
3 : You still have to do treasures and floods.
2 : Yeah
2 : I meant like action. Alright so that is that. Water's
2 : Rise.
3 : No
1 : Oh boy
2 : Yeah
1 : Four cards
3 : Alright so
2 : Ok
1 : Ok you have to shuffle those.
2 : So I'll shuffle
1 : Ok that makes it easier that we only need
3 : Mmhmm
3 : I feel like it'd be really hard to do if we needed to get all four, I don't think it'd be like
3 : It's just that (--) possible.
1 : Yeah
2 : So we have
2 : Whispering
3 : Did you take
3 : four?
3 : Ok
2 : Yes.
2 : Whispering Garden
2 : is done.
3 : So that's done.
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : is flipped.
3 : Ok
3 : I was like whoa
1 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : Temple of the Sun
1 : Gone.
3 : Done.
2 : And Coral Palace is
1 : It's gone.
3 : Alright
2 : How have we never picked a Fool's Landing card?
3 : I don't know.
3 : Maybe there just aren't-
1 : I know
3 : Yeah I don't know.
2 : Maybe they're at the bottom.
3 : Alright so we are flying.
2 : Yes, we're flying.
1 : Get rid of that.
3 : And that's all we're doing.
2 : Yeah
3 : So
1 : Yeah and then, take your treasure cards.
3 : yup.
3 : Just discard this guy, it doesn't matter
3 : and
2 : Four
1 : Four
1 : Gues that just goes on top then.
2 : Wait were there not four in there already?
1 : You have to put these ones back on top, right?
2 : No cause the waters didn't rise.
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh, oh, oh
3 : So it's just the next four, so it's fine.
1 : Alright, sorry.
3 : Alright, so, one, two, three, four.
1 : Oh there's a Fool's Landing.
3 : Um all remaining things flip.
1 : Wait, this is gone
1 : and that one's gone.
3 : Um this one's done.
3 : Is this one done?
1 : Mmhmm, it was flipped.
3 : But we didn't draw that card.
1 : I thought you said all remaining things
3 : No I, I mispoke.
1 : Oh I thought it was like a card that said
3 : So yeah we flip
2 : That's this one, yeah.
3 : or
1 : Yeah that gets flipped.
2 : Yeah that's done.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : And we can still exit when it's flipped, right? Or no?
2 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : I think so.
3 : Ok
2 : I think, yeah.
3 : So
1 : Well I could flip it anyway, so
3 : Yeah, and then this guy- Or do we just flip this now? Yeah that's, that's done.
1 : We
3 : Doesn't matter.
2 : Uh what was that?
3 : Uh I don't
2 : We flipped all of them so like
1 : Yeah we just flipped all of them
3 : Oh we just flipped them, ok, yeah so that's- Alright that can still stay.
2 : Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was still here.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Alright, so that's, that's that. These are the
3 : flood cards.
1 : Ok so now it's my turn right?
2 : Yeah
3 : And just leave. Yeah we're done.
1 : Ok I'll just flip this, in case cause I'm not sure if it has to be flipped over or not, but we'll do that.
3 : Yup
3 : Yeah, and then use your Helicopter and we win.
2 : I don't know either.
1 : And then
1 : yeah Helicopter goes over there and then
1 : yay.
3 : Great, done.
2 : Cool.

1 : Ok
1 : so that's two actions
3 : (--) three
1 : Right
3 : I think that you shored up the one, or can you shore up more than one?
1 : I can shore that's my special power these two
3 : Ah ok I gotcha
1 : I'll shore up this one
1 : uh
1 : I draw. Can you pass me two deck cards please?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Thank you
1 : K so one of them is the Water Rise
1 : so
1 : that is sunk.
1 : This goes with that
2 : My turn
1 : Now it's your turn I think, yup.
2 : Yup
2 : So I can take up to three actions, move, shore up,
2 : give a treasure card
2 : capture a treasure
2 : (--)
2 : Ok so
2 : um
2 : shore up
2 : (--)
2 : (--) action shore up
2 : for the other (--)
2 : simply flip it over so it's unflooded (--)
2 : So I have to take an adjacent one right?
1 : Yeah, no, none of your adjacent cards are flooded.
2 : None of them. So that doesn't help, ok.
2 : Give a treasure card
2 : You may give a treasure card
2 : to another player if both your pawns are on the same- No that doesn't help
1 : Although your special power is that you can give them anywhere
2 : Oh yeah thanks
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Your treasure (--) to a player anywhere for one action per card
2 : So I can- Let's see
2 : Messenger can give a single card to anyone anywhere when it is her turn but may not be on the same tile
2 : Hmm
2 : (--) treasure
2 : Can I take two of these?
2 : (--)
1 : Yeah, yeah, I guess you don't have to use all of your actions yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah if I can't use all the actions, I mean sometimes you can't right?
1 : Right
2 : Shore up any tile on the island
3 : Oh that's a sandbag
3 : Uh shore, shoring up
2 : Oh
3 : would be- You, you just flooded it out, you have to
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh, that means turning it over right? I don't wanna
3 : Yeah
3 : turning it over if it's blue.
2 : Oh yeah
3 : (--) flooding
2 : Ok
2 : Discard a treasure discard pile
3 : K so I'm up
1 : Um
1 : Do you have to draw flood cards?
3 : Oh I should just draw flood cards yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Two of them.
2 : Flood card
3 : S-
3 : Find the corresponding island card and flip it over
3 : so it's flooded and blue becomes blue
2 : Sorry it'll take me a minute
2 : a
3 : That's fine I'll help you out. Lost Lagoon
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah Lost Lagoon, let's see
1 : And here, so that one's done.
3 : That one, that one goes away
2 : Ok, so we take that one and Cliffs of Abandon
3 : I'll take, I'll take that card too.
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and
2 : that was that one.
3 : Oh Lost Lagoon- Oops wrong one, wrong one.
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Cliffs of Abandon, there we go.
3 : Cliffs of
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : And we wanna turn this one around
3 : Right there
3 : Flipped yeah
2 : Take this one
3 : There we go
2 : And that one goes
3 : Let's put that on the
3 : discard pile there.
2 : Ok
3 : (Ok now we're gonna)
3 : This
3 : Can I shore up one that's on
3 : Another one is on it
1 : What was the Cliffs?
3 : If someone's on that can I, can I shore that up?
1 : Uh yeah I think so
3 : Ok
3 : That's two actions.
2 : So we don't want any um
3 : Um
2 : flood showing, right?
2 : We don't want any of the other side
3 : That can go to a different one I guess.
1 : It'll make it easier to move around the board if they don't
1 : sink.
3 : (--)
3 : (--)
3 : So if something was red to I get that one there?
3 : Take up to three actions. Is this the third action?
3 : Right uh
1 : Or did you fly and then shore up two
3 : I flew, I flew, shored up
3 : Oh, I flew and then I shored up. Oh there we go, never mind.
3 : Ah I gotcha ok
3 : and then I get
3 : two treasure cards.
3 : Alright
3 : Yeah
3 : And then
3 : I get two
3 : flood cards
3 : I think.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
3 : So Breaker's Bridge
3 : (--) find Breaker's Bridge or Phantom Rock.
2 : Breaker's Bridge
3 : Phantom Rock and
3 : Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Breaker's Bridge, Breaker's Bridge.
3 : There it is.
1 : Good
1 : Ok
1 : Do you think I can give you
1 : two of these in one action?
3 : Uh
3 : I uh I don't know.
3 : I mean I uh I can give you two in mine
1 : Well what I'm thinking I'll do is move to your tile and then give you two of these as a second action cause since you already have one.
3 : Sure, yeah.
1 : Uh
1 : give you those.
3 : Ok
1 : Uh we can always change them I think you hang on to these.
3 : I don't
3 : Hang on to them ok
1 : Yeah although
3 : Ok I gotcha
1 : I might give you more than five huh?
2 : Yeah if you have six yeah you have to. It says only have five
3 : Oh yeah that's more than five, yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : How many do you have there?
2 : If you have six
3 : I have six- five- Wait no I got- No I got six, yeah.
1 : Six
3 : Uh I guess I give one away- Then I can't do it on my action or
1 : I wonder which one you must discard
3 : Do I- I have to discard one I'll discard Lift
3 : or
3 : I'll discard this guy.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah this guy's better
3 : Discard it
3 : Right over here. Actually never mind.
1 : And then
1 : I will shore up this one with my third action.
3 : And that one's already shored up
1 : Uh
3 : It just looks blue.
1 : It just doesn't (--)
2 : No it was blue and white.
1 : I said it was that one huh?
3 : Yeah
3 : (--) maybe the, the key is that safe is white on the bottom, maybe
2 : Ah yeah
3 : Isn't the blue- the blue (--) is misleading.
1 : Um
1 : yeah.
1 : Two of these
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Hey my turn?
2 : Ok let's see
2 : Draw two treasure deck cards
2 : (--) move yourself.
2 : Are there any next to me? Nope
2 : Uh yeah this one right?
2 : Turn this one over?
2 : Ok, capture treasure, can't do that
2 : Let's see
3 : (--)
2 : What's that?
3 : Water's Rice
3 : Move it up one
2 : Yeah I have to use that one
2 : Shuffle this right?
2 : (--)
3 : No, no, no. That one goes in there I think and then
2 : What one
3 : No, no over here
2 : Capture a treasure, can't do that.
1 : (--) let's throw these back on top.
3 : Yeah
2 : K do I get one more action?
3 : I don't know how many that was
2 : I moved that one, I took two cards
1 : I think once you start drawing
1 : the treasure cards and then
1 : (--) that then you don't
1 : get any more actions. But um
2 : Oh that's it then.
1 : draw flood cards. Draw three flood cards.
3 : Three, yeah
2 : Three.
3 : Yeah
3 : I'll get that for you
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : that's sunk right?
3 : That's sunk yeah, so I'll take that.
2 : And Phantom Rock
3 : Phantom Rock's over here
3 : I'll put that on the pile there
3 : (--) uh
3 : Fly over here
3 : and shore up this
3 : and then
3 : get the treasure.
3 : Or wait- Yeah trade
3 : (--)
3 : Trade
3 : or, or I can't trade, I got to give
3 : Uh
3 : Guess I'll- I'll just give you one
1 : I don't think you can give the special actions
3 : Oh
3 : I can't give the special ones away? Ok
1 : Uh hang on to those
3 : Yeah I'll let that go then.
3 : (--) too
3 : sandbags
3 : Then I gotta get
3 : three.
3 : Iron Gate,
3 : Whispering Garden
3 : and Temple to the, of the Moon.
1 : Why are you, why are you flooding them?
3 : Because they- Theirs are the floods uh
3 : flood cards.
1 : Oh, I'm sorry I thought you were still on the same moves.
3 : Yeah
3 : What am I doing- I can only one- Oh five cards in my hand, I got this card one.
3 : Ok I guess I'll
3 : discard that.
1 : Ok
1 : I'll give you this, I'll take one of them
3 : Thank you
1 : This next move you should fly there.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah yeah
1 : Uh ok ok
2 : Oh they have to be standing on the same tile
3 : Uh, ok
3 : Darn
1 : I was thinking ahead to when you, when you were still back there
2 : This is confu- confusing
1 : Can I take back moves?
1 : Do you think I can take back moves?
2 : I guess it's
1 : What if I were to
1 : shore this one up and then make the two moves that I made
1 : From as my three actions
2 : Guess we have to think about it
1 : K
3 : Mm
1 : For my first action, doing this
1 : then I'm doing that.
1 : Ok
1 : Messenger
2 : Ok my turn.
2 : So what, what's like the best strategy like that I should do first?
1 : I wish I knew the answer to that one
3 : I don't, I don't know
2 : I know I'm trying to figure it- I don't know. Like I don't wanna take the cards yet
2 : Maybe yourself
2 : one space.
2 : Horizontal or vertical you can move onto a flooded tile.
2 : Ok
2 : You could move a tile
2 : back to norm- From flooded back to normal
2 : if it is adjacent- Ok, right
1 : Yeah I think that would be a useful thing to do
3 : As an action, yeah
2 : That's one
2 : What do these things mean?
3 : That means that
3 : something
3 : I don't know
3 : I don't know what the green one means.
2 : Ok so I can move that, or I shored
2 : shore up
2 : Move yourself to another island tile
1 : I think that's just where we began
1 : the little icon.
3 : Oh, I thought- Well, eh
2 : Oh ok
1 : I started here
3 : Oh, that makes sense yeah, cause you're green.
2 : Ok
3 : Or someone else is green
2 : Now I can pick card
2 : right?
2 : Draw two
2 : Treasure deck cards
2 : Ok
2 : Oh how many do you have? Three of those
3 : Yeah
2 : Can I give you one at anytime, doesn't it say as my power?
2 : Give treasure cards to play anywhere on the island
2 : for one
2 : action card
3 : Oh that's good
2 : So you would have four of those
1 : Yeah yeah, I think you exhausted your actions for this (--) turn
3 : Look at this card
2 : What's that?
1 : I think you exhausted your actions for this turn or you have to wait until the next time around (--) from this one (--) my turn so
3 : I can discard
2 : Oh ok
2 : Ok
2 : I know you have to use the Water Rise immediately. Which one do you have to use immediately?
3 : Yeah
2 : Was there one?
1 : Um yeah the Water Rises if you just pulled that
2 : We put up one mark
3 : I have to give that back
3 : Oh ok
2 : Why
3 : I don't know
1 : Did you just hand that one to- The other one you just give to him yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : guess it would
1 : count as an action.
2 : Oh
1 : But
3 : Can hold on for the next one
2 : Ok for the next time
1 : Yeah so shuffle these
2 : and then
1 : and then pull from them.
3 : Yeah
2 : What
2 : Right?
1 : Yeah (--)
3 : Yeah we gotta move the ticker up. Did we do that? Yeah we did that
2 : (--), I'm trying to learn
2 : What's that?
3 : Never mind
2 : Ok
1 : And then pull three flood cards
2 : Ok, Whispering Garden
3 : Oh
1 : Um
2 : (--)
2 : Copper Gate
3 : Copper Gate yeah, I'll take that
2 : and Crimson Forest
3 : There we go
3 : K
3 : uh
1 : I think you should fly to me so I can give you one of these on my next turn
3 : Sounds like a plan
3 : And I, can I- I don't know if I can do this diagonally
1 : You're the Pilot
2 : It's just diagonal
1 : You're the Pilot
1 : you can fly anywhere
2 : Uh that's right
3 : Oh yeah- (--) flip that
1 : Ok
3 : For my first action I think, cause I'm on it
1 : Yeah
3 : and then go to there.
3 : And then uh, or, wait no
3 : second action.
3 : This third action
3 : and then
3 : That alright or no?
1 : Uh not diagonal
3 : Shore up, you can flip an island tile from flooded back to normal
1 : But
2 : If you're on it or adjacent
3 : If you are adjacent to it
1 : Yeah ok
3 : I was adjacent, or no I wasn't, never mind it was diagonally yeah
1 : Diagonal
3 : Ah ok so
3 : I'll just uh
3 : then I'll just pick treasures.
3 : Uh
3 : that's an action pick a, pick a treasure then an action, yeah
3 : Oh wait, that's after I give away an action ok
3 : Dump
3 : (--)
3 : (--)
3 : or
3 : can I give that away?
3 : Well I have it in my hand, I can't give it away, no I can't
3 : Discard
3 : discard
3 : and then
3 : Yeah, I guess that's- Uh that's right, yeah
1 : And then three
1 : Yeah, yeah, (--)
2 : Three of them
3 : Three
3 : Uh Iron Gate,
3 : Temple of the Moon,
3 : and Cliffs of Abandon
3 : There we go
1 : Ok, my first action
3 : K
3 : Yeah
2 : Beat me to that one
1 : Can you get this now
3 : Perfect
1 : And
1 : second action
3 : Or no I have four, I only have four.
2 : You need five- We need five of them
3 : I need five, I need a fifth one
1 : Can you draw five then?
3 : She's got, she's got the last one
2 : Oh ok, so my turn I'll give it
3 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : K, so you have to use an action, you have to use an ac-
3 : Oh wait no, four matching- No, four matching cards
2 : Wait what
1 : But you'll have to, you'll have to use one of your actions
3 : Well- Oh well, I've gotta be on the tile, I've gotta be on the tile. Yeah, there we go
1 : Ok
3 : That makes sense
1 : That's fine
1 : Oh
3 : Oh I'm on it already- Oh well, I've gotta wait for my- That's an action
3 : I guess
3 : Ah
2 : If you discard four matching treasure cards while on the corresponding tile- Ok so you have to be
3 : Yeah- Ok discard, I have to discard em, yeah
1 : So you have four and you're on it. You just have to use an action on it
3 : Ye-
3 : Use an action on it, ok
1 : Yeah ok
3 : Ok
1 : Second action,
1 : third
1 : I have four
3 : Nice
1 : Discard one of these
3 : (Shut em up)
1 : Uh Tidal Palace, sorry
3 : What's the other one?
1 : This one
2 : (--)
1 : K
3 : (--)
1 : Alright
1 : your turn.
2 : You done with yours? No I don't wanna (--)
2 : Do you have- You gave him one right?
3 : Yeah, yeah, I got the four. Yeah
2 : So we don't need to do that
3 : Not on that, yeah
2 : Ok
2 : and then you just have to wait till I- you land, till it's your turn again.
3 : Till it's my turn, yeah.
2 : Mm
2 : See
2 : Ok
2 : The treasure card (--)
2 : (--)
1 : You should just shore some of these up around here
1 : See
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah I mean that's- what else can I do?
1 : Yeah I would shore up Whispering Garden
1 : as one of them
3 : Definitely.
2 : Ok
1 : Do you have one more action?
2 : Yeah, I have one more
1 : (--)one of the other two (--)

2 : cause I would've moved him
2 : Well I could still move another one right?
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you have one of these
3 : Yeah
1 : too.

2 : So we have to try to move
2 : this closer to that one right?
1 : So we'd start- Yeah as a move
3 : Yeah
2 : And
2 : take two cards,
1 : Do you wanna use all three of your actions?
2 : What's that?
1 : Do you wanna just use all three of your actions to move?

2 : and then take two of these.
2 : Silver Gate

3 : No pull four of them
1 : Wait what did you just flip?
1 : Where did those come from?
2 : What these two?
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah the Water Rise we did- We had to do this
2 : The treasure
2 : We did that and then I did my treasure cards already
1 : And then
3 : Ok, so- Yeah pick four of those then
1 : Ok so you've done two of them.
2 : Pick four of these now
1 : But I, I got, I got lose there with what you, with what you said
2 : Eh I, I did two. Ok
3 : Yeah that's alright
2 : Alright
1 : We must concede defeat in five seconds
3 : Yeah
2 : What's that?
3 : We're done
2 : What's that?
3 : Yeah

3 : Alright team we got this, ok
1 : Ok so, I go first.
3 : mm
1 : Um
1 : So I take up three actions
1 : I guess I will
3 : You may want to like
1 : Shore up the adjacent tiles
1 : I guess
1 : Number one
3 : Yeah get Whispering Garden cause that's an important one
1 : Then move to
1 : Whispering Garden
4 : Yeah then you can shore up two again.
1 : Yeah shore up two again.
1 : But can I do it more than once per turn? I for-
1 : Some, some of those were only like once per- per turn.
3 : Does yours
3 : Does it say on it?
1 : No it just says two for one action so I can do it
1 : And then draw the
1 : Draw two crea- treasure cards
4 : Two
1 : Ok
3 : Aw no
1 : I got the Water's Rise, so I have to do that.
2 : Hmmm.
3 : Darn
1 : So
1 : Move this one up one.
1 : Shuffle this thing and put it back
1 : On top
1 : And then discard that.
3 : I can like
4 : And draw two of the
3 : Oh yeah, ok
3 : Yeah you do have the
4 : Of the yeah
2 : Of these ones? Yeah.
1 : Yes
1 : So Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate.
2 : Oh there we go
3 : Oh no it sunk
3 : Shoot
2 : Crushin' it.
3 : Oh wait this goes, yeah
4 : And then I need the um
4 : the
2 : The Gold Gate one.
4 : Yeah the Gold Gate one.
1 : Oh yes.
3 : That's not even fair. We didn't even have a chance.
2 : Didn't even have a chance. Ok.
2 : Ah my turn.
3 : Yeah you're over there
2 : I'll probably just- you can take up to three, so I'll probably just move one.
2 : And
2 : Pick cards
4 : Yeah
2 : Unless you think I should do something else
1 : Wait shouldn't you do
3 : Wait do you want to like
3 : Do you want to like start collecting his little
1 : What
1 : What's your special power again?
2 : I can only give cards to other people.
1 : Ok.
2 : My special power is
1 : Um
3 : Oh you can only give cards or?
2 : I can give cards and it-
1 : What else can you do
3 : Well if you moved to his island I guess
3 : You could like take the blue cup thing
3 : and you could start collecting those
2 : I can give treasure cards. Not take.
3 : I guess you could
3 : No but if you're on the same island can't everyone give cards?
3 : Or no?
1 : Oh yeah I could, if you're on
3 : Is that a rule?
1 : No, ah never mind.
3 : Oh it's not a rule, ok never mind.
1 : I can't, you can't.
3 : Yeah that
4 : I don't think there's anything you can really do, then.
2 : Yeah so should I just pick the two?
3 : Ok never mind
4 : Yeah
3 : You can just move around
2 : And Sandbags and then, two of these?
2 : Phantom Rock and Cliffs of Abandon
4 : By Phantom Rock. Can I see that then?
2 : Oh my God.
2 : Yeah Phantom Rock.
4 : Yeah
3 : It was just in the way it's fine.
2 : And Cliffs of Abandon.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok.
3 : Oh
3 : I don't know
4 : If you move here, you can shore that one up.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Oh true
3 : Ok
3 : I'll do that and then I'll shore
4 : Yeah and then you don't have to do the third one if
4 : I don't
4 : know what you would do
3 : Mhmm
3 : Um
3 : Yep
3 : I mean I can
3 : Yeah, right ok
3 : Oh another one, fun
3 : And then
3 : Whispering Garden and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Whispering Garden
2 : Right under it
4 : Ok
4 : So
4 : I can move
4 : diagonally
4 : So I could move here.
4 : For one.
4 : Shore up diagonally
4 : And then
4 : shore up
4 : adjacent.
3 : Good call
2 : And then you get two.
4 : mmhmm.
4 : And then two flood cards.
4 : Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.
4 : And then could you, thanks.
1 : Um not sure if there's anything I can do.
1 : Much
4 : Um
1 : Um
2 : Lost Lagoon
1 : Yeah I could move one then shore up the Lost Lagoon then
4 : Um
4 : Or
4 : You could move two and then shore up Temple of the Moon since it's um
4 : one of the eight
4 : ones.
3 : YHeah
1 : Yeah well but I could
2 : Do that
3 : Or I could move you somewhere if you want to go
1 : Have we pulled, we haven't pulled Temple of the Moon yet have we? I don't think.
1 : Did that start out flooded or did we already draw it?
3 : No it's right there, we drew it
4 : No we just did that one so if you had another Flood Card it could be coming up and then if we lose it
2 : It's right there we just drew it
1 : Oh so but
4 : That's one of the two to get
4 : Um
4 : That
1 : I think they- they're- they're probably only in there once I think
1 : Are they or are they- are they repeated?
3 : Yeah but if we get Water's Rise you have to put it on top.
4 : Yeah but if we get a- a Water's Rising
2 : Yeah
1 : No but then you can
1 : do it next time for your first thing
1 : Oh yeah but you but it back on af- as soon as you do Water's
1 : if you get the Water's Rise.
1 : Yeah then you draw two more, yeah I should do that.
3 : Mhmm
1 : So one,
1 : Two
1 : There we go
1 : Then
1 : That's three move- actions.
4 : That's three.
4 : Yeah
1 : So two of those
1 : Oh we did
2 : Hmm.
1 : So
1 : Put that away
1 : Shuffle that
1 : Yeah we don't really care about those two anyway, I guess.
1 : Then draw three of these.
1 : Ah that's a good idea.
2 : (safe)
1 : Um
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Where is that?
1 : And Lost Lagoon
2 : Oh right here.
1 : Lost Lagoon sunk
4 : Ok (--)
3 : Oh you guys
3 : Just keep the- only the necesary tiles
3 : and then
2 : Ok so my turn
2 : I'm gonna
2 : do that for one and then do Cliffs of Abandon for another
2 : Um
2 : Should I get
2 : rid of card because
2 : Um aren't I gonna have to discard cause I already have four?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah but if you draw two you could like
4 : Pick which one to discard then
3 : Yeah I guess but I mean
1 : You can, yeah you can
1 : this
1 : Ah I'm the only one who has one of these
2 : Yeah
2 : I pick three though
2 : Ok so
1 : You pick
2 : Hmm
1 : You picked three?
3 : Two
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh two? And then the water card is the- ok
1 : Yeah I know
3 : And then you have to discard one immediately.
2 : Sandbags
3 : No
3 : I would keep, I don't know, I feel like you're about to get four of those so throw away one of the cups
4 : I would keep the Sandbags
1 : That might be useful yeah.
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
4 : Especially you're really close to the Temple of the Moon which is that so.
3 : Oh yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : Bye
2 : And then three.
1 : Maybe you could give her
1 : that
1 : one uh when it's your turn
4 : yeah yeah
1 : Then you can
1 : get it on the next time
4 : I can do that
2 : Then we just need one more. So
3 : I could fly you there
2 : And then I take three of the water.
1 : Yes
2 : Um, Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Iron Gate and Whispering Garden.
4 : Iron Gate is done, we need the card for that.
3 : Iron Gate's gone.
1 : Whispering Garden.
2 : Iron Gate.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Gosh I feel like I'm so useless in this game
3 : Um
4 : No you could
3 : I guess like yeah
4 : Shore up this then move there and then shore up that one.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : and shore you up
3 : Aqnd then that's probably it cause everything's good now so.
4 : That's yeah. That's three.
1 : It's three moves anyway.
3 : Oh yeah, ok
1 : Two of them
3 : So two of these
3 : Ok so that makes five
3 : Um if you're gonna go for that then I'll just throw this away.
4 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : But I have the
4 : I can give you one on my turn
2 : Oh we need four? Ok never mind then
3 : Yeah cause she's going next anyways.
4 : Yeah
3 : Three of these
3 : Copper Gate
3 : Crimson Forest and Howling Garden
1 : Copper Gate.
4 : Crimson Forest. Ok.
3 : You see Crimson Forest? yeah
4 : Mm, so for my first move
2 : Thanks
4 : At
4 : Um
4 : Oh so- well
1 : Oh
3 : You have to be on the same tile.
1 : Yeah one
2 : There we go awesome. Thanks.
4 : There we go. One, two.
4 : And then I don't know should I shore up this? Do you think it matters which one?
1 : Well that one we can maybe walk through it more easily.
4 : Yeah so.
2 : Yeah.
1 : That might be more useful
4 : That one
4 : Here we go
3 : Really fast I'm just gonna use Sandbags for this one cause
4 : That's
3 : cause I'm scared it's gonna like get flooded
4 : Ok
1 : You can do that any time right?
3 : and you can do it at any time so, yeah.
4 : Yeah
4 : Cause it's a special action then I need two of the
4 : Treasure cards.
4 : Water rises.
4 : And then one of these, so discard that
1 : I can shuffle it for you
4 : Yeah good call cause it's probably gonna come up.
3 : Like every other card is water rises
2 : Ok
2 : One, two, three, four
2 : Don't I have to get rid of one? Cause I have six?
1 : How many? Three cards?
3 : Oh have you had six?
2 : Yeah I just realized I got six when she gave it to me. So Crimson Forest.
3 : Oh my gosh
3 : yeah
4 : Yeah.
4 : Ok so
2 : Sorry about that.
4 : Um Whispering Garden.
4 : Crimson Forest.
4 : And Howling Garden. Ok.
4 : Ugh
2 : Got it.
4 : Your turn Engineer.
2 : Go for it.
1 : Um
1 : So, take three actions. I guess I can sh- I should shore some stuff up.
1 : Um
4 : Yeah if
1 : Whis-
3 : Wait are you guys all on the same tile?
4 : Yeah we're all on the same tile
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : We're just chillin'
3 : Cause you could
4 : Well if you moved here you could sh-
3 : give her two of the little fire things and then she could eventually move
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah give her the two fire things
4 : Oh yeah
1 : How about I could do that?
3 : and I guess you could discard one of your little
1 : one, but then there's nothing else I can do except
1 : I can't shore anything up then
4 : So he could either
3 : you could move like one, two, oh I guess
1 : but then that's one
4 : Yeah he could either give me one card
1 : (--)
4 : And then like move her and like shore this up or (--) two cards.
4 : And then put them but you wouldn't be able to shore it up
3 : I can put you somehwere, I have two of these it doesn't matter.
1 : Can I
1 : pl-
1 : give- do an action and then you do that, then I do another action?
3 : Yeah it says it can be used at any time.
1 : Ok so I'll do that so
2 : Ok
1 : Two actions
3 : Then you have to
3 : throw away one of these, yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Then you move me
3 : You're on- which one, do you care?
1 : Th- This one has the
1 : treasure
4 : Uh
3 : Yeah I mean I could just move these three to there
2 : Straight to there and then shore it up. Yeah.
1 : Oh yeah.
4 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Ok.
3 : Ok, yeah
4 : And then your third action would be shoring it up, ok.
1 : Right.
3 : Yay
2 : Ok.
2 : Um.
2 : Treasure time?
1 : So that's an action. So it's two actions now.
2 : Yeah so that would be it.
1 : Oh right.
3 : Oh you didn't do Flood Cards.
1 : Yeah, stupid
1 : So
4 : Well you could also for your third one.
1 : I had, I had, I didn't
1 : do that. I had to draw it through the Treasure. I forgot the cards.
2 : Oh right.
3 : Right.
2 : Yeah (--)
3 : And the water.
2 : And the
1 : Yeah of course.
2 : Water thing.
1 : So this then three cards.
1 : It is
1 : Yours, your move back. Ok so.
1 : Cliffs of Abandon. Temple of the Moon.
1 : And Copper Gate.
2 : mm.
1 : So where's Cliffs of Abandon?
2 : Did we?
4 : Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : Ok.
2 : Ok
3 : And we can still use those even if they're flipped so, you're still fine.
1 : Right.
2 : Yeah
1 : So
4 : And then once we get the treasure it's unimportant
3 : Yay
2 : Ok we're good.
1 : Got it, yeah
1 : So one
3 : Yay!
2 : Treasure.
3 : Then that's another, that's two actions.
1 : Two
2 : And then
4 : So you could like shore it up if you wanted as the third
4 : or like shore one of
3 : Oh you could shore up one of- like this one.
1 : Yeah.
4 : Yeah
1 : What's your power?
2 : Uh
2 : I can give cards
1 : Oh yeah.
2 : to people.
2 : Um
4 : Yes.
1 : You might as well shore one up.
4 : Yeah, just, just shore.
2 : Just shore up the one that I'm on. Yeah.
4 : Probably this one. Yeah.
3 : Mhmm
2 : Just to be safe.
2 : Ok
1 : You discard those right?
2 : And then
2 : Do I put them in the discard pile or do I just like
3 : I'm trying to see
1 : Or do you throw them all the way out? I- I forget
2 : So yeah it just says discard, so I guess it's discarded, ok.
3 : Do you see it anywhere?
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, yeah
2 : And, yeah
2 : And then I choose two
2 : And I got two of these
2 : And
2 : Three of these.
2 : We have Breaker's Bridge, Cave of Embers and Silver Gate.
4 : Ok
3 : Cave of Embers.
4 : And Silver Gate did you say?
2 : Yeah Silver Gate.
4 : Ok
3 : Alright.
3 : I'm gonna start flipping stuff over then.
3 : So I'll use one action.
3 : Um
3 : And then I'll fly here as an action.
3 : And then flip this over just to have
3 : And that's my turn.
3 : And little statue, little dude.
3 : Um Bronze Gate, Coral Palace and Dunes of Deception.
3 : Coral alace
3 : K
4 : Ok
2 : Shore up Copper Gate because on your turn you can give me the cup.
1 : Ok.
2 : And then I could just get the treasure.
4 : Ok so shore up Copper Gate.
4 : Um
2 : And I guess
1 : You want to
1 : You can't get that
1 : Oh does someone have
1 : Can I use my Helicopter thing to move you?
3 : Yeah you can use it whenever
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok I'll
1 : give- use a Helicopter
4 : Ok
2 : No
1 : to move you
1 : to, do you want to go to this one or this one?
4 : If you move me to Pilot's Landing I can shore up both of these cause my special thing is shoring up diagonally.
3 : No but don't you want to like
3 : get rid of those?
4 : Oh yeah that's true too.
1 : You want to move there or there to get
2 : No
1 : the
4 : Yeah
1 : the treasure for your second action.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah so if I
3 : Yeah maybe this one cause it's more central
1 : Then you can
1 : move here and shore up this one for your third action? Ok.
4 : Yeah.
4 : Let's do that. So
2 : Ok.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Move here.
4 : Move there.
2 : Shore up this one.
1 : (--) two through three.
4 : And then
2 : Discard pile. Sweet.
1 : Yes.
4 : So that's three and then two
3 : Nice.
3 : Nice!
4 : Treasure cards
2 : Sorry
4 : And then three flood
2 : And three of these, um
2 : Tidal pla-
2 : Palace,
4 : Ok.
2 : Temple of the Sun
2 : And
2 : Misty Marsh.
4 : Misty Marsh is
2 : Oh this one right here?
4 : Ok
1 : I should
2 : Ok.
1 : Shore up some stuff on this turn.
3 : Wait where are you? You're over there right?
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yes.
4 : Yeah he's here.
3 : Ok.
3 : Um
3 : If I give you these two like if I fly
3 : myself over with this and give you these two then you can
1 : But you can't- that- that has to be on your turn
2 : We only need, we only need three treasures right?
3 : Get the yellows
3 : We'll- yeah.
2 : Um because I have three of these so if he gives me the cup then I can just go to Tidal Palace and we could be done.
3 : No this can be any turn
1 : Oh yes.
3 : Ok.
1 : Which color are you?
1 : But we have to have an other Helicopter Lift to escape.
3 : True, ok.
3 : Yeah ok, so go do that.
2 : So yeah.
2 : So
2 : Give me the cup
1 : One
4 : Wait don't you have to be on the same tile as to give-
2 : Oh right. Same tile. I keep forgetting that. Ok so then move to me for three. We could do that.
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh right, right.
1 : Never mind. Yeah.
4 : So
1 : But then I couldn't shore up anything. That could be dangerous.
4 : Ok. So for you to be able to move
3 : You can
4 : Um
4 : I think we need to shore up this because if this gets sunk then you're kind of
4 : then you can only move here and like
4 : You know what I mean?
2 : Yeah.
3 : Oh yeah you could do two at a time right?
1 : Yeah. I can shore up all
1 : like
1 : Move here, shore up these two.
4 : You can- yes.
3 : Can't do diagonal though.
3 : That's diagonal you can't do that.
1 : No like move and then shore up is two actions.
3 : Oh the
3 : oh those two, ok yeah.
4 : Yeah so if you moved here and then shored up these two that would give her like a path down that we wouldn't have to worry about them like getting flooded and her getting stuck.
3 : Ok yeah do that. That's a good call.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Then
1 : I can't give it to you though.
1 : Oh well.
4 : Yeah but.
4 : I mean she'd have to make it all the way down there anyways.
4 : So it's possible that like
2 : Yeah, I could just do straight down
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah well I'll- I'll definitely do that so that's my one
3 : Yeah but that's part of
3 : Yeah we could just hold off
4 : One
3 : like
4 : And that's two.
1 : Is there a third move I can do?
3 : If you want to like
3 : move next to her, I don't know like
3 : Or like go to Misty Marsh
3 : Or (--)
1 : Where might I want to move next?
1 : Um I have these cards that might be if I
1 : might want to stay close to the Whispering Garden in case I can get four somehow.
4 : Yeah.
4 : Yeah I think that's like a good like central spot to stay.
2 : Yeah just stay there.
1 : Ok I'll just stop and stay here and then pick those cards.
3 : Yeah you could just stop if you want yeah.
2 : Yeah you don't have to do all three.
2 : And Water's Rise and Helicopter.
1 : Water's of course.
2 : Got one
3 : Oh good we have the two Helicopters.
1 : Oh that goes in that treasure discard.
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok um
1 : Wait I have to draw the card- these cards first.
3 : Oh
1 : The
2 : Oh you're shuffling them?
1 : Draw the flood- Shuffle, put it back, and draw the flood cards.
3 : Right right.
1 : Still three.
2 : Mhmm.
1 : Uh Crimson Forest.
1 : That one's gone.
4 : Ok I need the card for it.
1 : Howling Garden.
1 : And Misty Marsh.
4 : Yeah so good thing we did that otherwise it would've sunk and you had been like stuck.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah.
1 : That's it.
1 : So
2 : Yeah and I'm just gonna move
1 : Is it
1 : your third action you can shore something up?
2 : um
1 : Misty Marsh I don't-
2 : I'll just, I'll just do Misty Marsh again whatever.
3 : Just why not like
3 : It's been good to us.
2 : It's been
2 : Uh
1 : Oh you got it
2 : Oh sweet.
2 : Even better.
3 : Oh nice
2 : Um and then I take three.
2 : And we Temple of the Moon.
2 : Um
2 : Copper gate.
2 : And Whispering Garden.
4 : Copper Gate
2 : Ok yeah
4 : Ok
3 : Uh
3 : I'll flip you over
1 : You know maybe
1 : since, if you can
1 : get this card on your next turn should everyone else move towards the Fool's Landing?
4 : (--) yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Right.
4 : That's a good idea.
2 : Yeah.
3 : I'll fly me here then.
3 : And I guess that's it.
3 : Ok.
4 : Alrighty so
3 : Um I'll throw this away, and then
3 : that's too many cards so, why not.
2 : And then three of these.
2 : Uh CLiffs of Abandon
2 : Uh Cave of Embers and
2 : Silver Gate.
3 : Cave of Embers is gone.
4 : And so is Silver Gate.
4 : Ok
4 : So
1 : Well it's your turn now?
4 : Yeah.
4 : It's my turn.
1 : Whi- which one color are you gonna?
4 : I'm green
4 : so I could move here
1 : You-
1 : Move here, shore up that one, then move to Fool's Landing maybe?
4 : shore up
4 : shore up that? Yeah.
3 : oh that one sucked
4 : Ok
2 : And two
4 : And then yeah, two treasure cards.
1 : Three of these
4 : And three flood.
4 : Bronze Gate
4 : Coral Palace
2 : Hmm.
4 : and then Dunes of Deception.
3 : Ok I'm gonna use Sandbags and put this one back just in case.
4 : Ok can you t-
4 : Eh, sorry.
2 : Just to be safe
1 : Ok
2 : Ok.
1 : Um
1 : I have three moves
1 : I guess two moving there, why not shore up this one
4 : Yeah
3 : Sure
1 : One, two, three.
4 : Just in case that somehow sinks
2 : Ok.
3 : All up to you, Messenger
2 : Oh, right
2 : We gotta do the
1 : Right.
1 : Uh oh, Waters Rise.
2 : Great!
3 : Wel'l-
1 : I have to draw four
3 : We'll be ok.
2 : I feel like-
1 : How I hope
3 : No we'll be fine.
2 : And the- the- yeah.
3 : Cause it won't be Fool's Landing cause we haven't gotten that one yet.

1 : And Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Silver Gate is right by you
3 : Oh Whispering Garden, oh where you guys are.
1 : Right here we're on it.
2 : Whisepring Garden.
2 : Oh no
1 : We're sitting on it
3 : That's ok
1 : It's ok
3 : They'll be fine
1 : After next time we won't need it.
3 : Um I can use a Sandbag any time to shore that up.
1 : Right.
3 : Um so now Messenger, it's your turn.
2 : Yeah.
3 : And first things first, right.
2 : Right.
2 : Cashing this in.
3 : We're cashing all these out.
2 : Because I'm sitting there.
3 : Put 'em right there and then you get that dude.
1 : This is yours.
2 : That
2 : Ok
2 : Can I shore that up where we are?
1 : Yeah
3 : (--) do that.
1 : Yeah, that could be your action number two.
2 : Two.
3 : Alright, want me to get that for your? Great.
2 : Yeah and then.
3 : Wow
2 : Action number three, can I give you a card?
3 : You can.
3 : Ah no you cannot, we're not on the same tile.
2 : Oh
3 : Yes
1 : Yeah you're on the same tile as me, but um.
2 : Can I shore up another one?
1 : Um you
3 : Hmm
2 : I have to be adjacent.
3 : Right
1 : Right, but you could move here and shore up next turn.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : And I collect your cards.
2 : Oh you have treasure
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : Oh
2 : K
2 : This is there.
3 : So you're good and I need
2 : Can't a Messenger
2 : (--) player anywhere on the island for one action per card
1 : Right so, maybe next turn you can hand those over.
3 : Oh wait a minute, what's the Messengers turn?
2 : Turn
3 : Oh
2 : That's my special power
3 : That is your special power. It's ok though. I only had one so ok
2 : So I can give these
2 : That's next turn
1 : Yeah
2 : Then we'll be able to cash out.
3 : Give treasure cards
3 : Right
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Wait ok that's good.
2 : So Bronze Gate
2 : Goes under, whoops
3 : Pretty good
2 : Cave of Shadows
3 : Cave of Shadows, that sounds terrifying
2 : of Shadows
2 : And Dunes of Deception go under
3 : Dunes of Deception, these are great.
1 : That doesn't sound especially nice either.
3 : Great.
3 : And
3 : (--) um
3 : Ok
3 : Cool
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : So
3 : What we can do
3 : Is I will move
2 : All of us to Fool's Landing
3 : Let's think
3 : We should save this because we're only one treasure away.
3 : We're gonna need that to get off.
3 : Ta
1 : So maybe you could move her and shore that one up since it has an Earth Stone.
1 : I can't.
3 : Ha
3 : I'm on board.
3 : So you'd shore that up.
3 : And that's my second move.
3 : And now I'll shore
3 : this one up for good measure.
1 : Or maybe even this one so you guys don't get trapped.
3 : There is a better idea.
3 : Ah hah.
2 : Hah
3 : Ah ha she's a sharp one.
2 : Ha
3 : Um ok.
3 : Now before I do this do I want to use maybe a Sandbag or something?
2 : Oh
3 : We're good, we're gonna need
2 : Sure, sure you can use the Sandbag's out of clay.
3 : Where are you right now?
1 : I'm here.
3 : Ta
3 : Ok
3 : So we want to get you to fire.
3 : Now
3 : um
2 : Oh that's one of your actions
3 : What if I use a Sandbag on this before my turn is over?
1 : To make sure we don't lose it.
3 : Right
1 : Yeah cause I think we lost one already
3 : And then I could fly you there but I don't know how many of these are left in there.
3 : Oh forget it that was
2 : Yeah don't waste that
1 : Yeah maybe.
3 : I can only fly myself
2 : Oh
3 : Right
3 : Ta
3 : Um so how about I do that?
3 : All in favor so I?
2 : Yeah
1 : Sure
3 : Oh alright
2 : Yeah, yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Now
3 : Two
3 : And we got fire and a chalice and I still have five
3 : and I need three of those.
3 : 
2 : Two, three
3 : The clock is ticking.
1 : It is
2 : (--)
3 : Misty Marsh
3 : Where green is.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ah (--) please, Howling Garden is on there.
3 : And Cave of Embers
3 : Cave of Embers
3 : Alright
1 : Which we can't get to anyway
3 : Right that's it's done.
3 : So Engineer
3 : What'll it be.
1 : I think I'm gonna take all my actions to move.
2 : You can't have more than
2 : Oh five
3 : No, that's, that's her Engineer card. That's five.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah ok
3 : Yeah she's good.
1 : Ok
1 : So I was thinking I would just go
1 : here
1 : and then cash in
1 : next turn.
3 : Ok
3 : I'm on board
1 : Ok so that's all my actions
3 : Cool
1 : Ah now I have to discard two now
2 : You do?
3 : Well you're using, you're using the Water Rush one, right now.
1 : Oh yeah, you're right, your're right.
3 : Yeah
3 : It's easy to lose one of them.
1 : Good point, good point.
2 : Good point.
3 : Good point, we get it.
3 : Um now that's an upgrade, three more.
2 : (--)
1 : Mmhmm yeah.
3 : Now, oh yes.

2 : Yeah, (--) yeah.
3 : Might as well. Let's just get creative over here.
2 : Yeah
3 : So we have four.
1 : There
1 : There's one turn.
2 : Right.
3 : That's one turn. How about you shore that up to just
3 : for kicks and giggles.
1 : Try it.
1 : Just because we can
3 : Right and now three.
2 : Uh huh.
1 : And
1 : three
3 : cool
1 : Ok
3 : You need two

1 : Mmhmm.
2 : That's ok
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Both Temples
1 : And the crimson Forest
3 : Well
3 : Now you, you can either just move right there or we can one
2 : One
2 : Two
3 : Two and now stop
1 : Mmhmm.
1 : Was it?
1 : Let's get out of here.
2 : Yeah
2 : (--)
3 : Now we can use this at any time.
2 : Alright.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : We're out.
1 : We're out.
1 : We did it.
1 : We got all the treasure.
3 : Now do we cheat at any point? I feel like we might of. I've never felt more ridiculous but satistifed at the same time.
1 : Hah
1 : I don't know.
1 : I don't know.
3 : This is very

2 : Oh boy
2 : Alright
1 : Ok so
2 : So first you draw
1 : Three
4 : Do your actions yeah
1 : Yes.
2 : Yeah your actions and then you draw.
1 : Ok, first action is to move right?
3 : First actions yes.
2 : So
4 : Or whatever you want.
3 : If you want to yeah.
2 : Or you can shore up.
1 : Ahhh
4 : You might yeah, you might want to cause there's like four
2 : I think we should try to keep these.
1 : Oh
2 : As unflooded as possible because we're gonna have to go to these ones.
1 : Ok
2 : In order to like actually get the
1 : So you want these two up?
4 : Yeah you should definitely shore up one of them cause there's so many.
3 : Correct.
2 : Those so yeah. You can dis- I would, you can do two right? Isn't that your special power?
1 : Yeah I can do two, so I can do this one and this one.
4 : You could do three.
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : Yeah cause you want to keep it as unflooded as possible probably so that we don't lose tiles.
1 : Yeah.
3 : To ensure optimum mobility yes.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Ok.
2 : So
4 : Can't you
1 : So
2 : You could move there and then do another two.
4 : Or couldn't you even just shore up more if you wanted to?
2 : Oh wait
1 : Would that be
2 : Can you only
2 : Shore up one, two tiles once.
4 : For one.
2 : Shore up.
1 : I am not sure.
3 : Shore up two tiles for one action doesn't say that it's limited to one- once per turn.
1 : Yeah it doesn't say, so I think that was just one action.
4 : Um yeah I'm pretty sure you can do whatever you want cause you can move more then you want to and it would just count as more of an option.
2 : One time.
2 : Yeah.
3 : So you could shore up to six tiles in an-
3 : well no, cause you would have to move.
1 : Ok so now this is my second action if I move here and then do these two.
2 : Yeah.
4 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Third action.
2 : And we also have to make sure Fool's Landing doesn't sink cause we need to use that to get out obviously.
4 : Ok, that's good
1 : That's a little bit important yeah.
2 : Um, and then.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Ok.
1 : Um take
4 : take two cards.
1 : Two of those.
2 : Unless you want to do a third thing.
1 : I can do a third thing.
4 : Didn't you already do that?
2 : She, flipped two. Oh you moved, you moved. Yeah, you're right you're right.
4 : You flipped two, moved, flipped two.
3 : No you move- flip two, moved, flip two.
3 : We're good.
1 : Ok.
1 : Ok.
2 : Oh no, Water's Rise.
1 : Ok so this is going up.
2 : So
2 : This will go in the discard here.
2 : And then I'll shuffle these for you.
1 : And Breaker's Bridge.
2 : You have to do two, because you're (--)
1 : Oh yeah sorry.
1 : Breaker's Bridge and Gold Gate.
2 : Uh Gold Gate, so Gold Gate sinks.
1 : Ok, that was quick.
2 : And, ah that's ok.
3 : mmhmm.
3 : So I get the Gold Gate
3 : card gets
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh yeah that has to go out, you're right.
3 : Withdrawn from play as well.
2 : And that's the end of your turn.
1 : Mmhm.
4 : Yup.
2 : So my turn.
2 : Where am I, I'm over here. Um
2 : Well,
2 : since I'm the Messenger I can like.
2 : Give cards to anywhere.
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : and I have this one and you also have that so I'm
2 : gonna give that to you cause then you'll have two.
4 : Ok.
2 : Um
2 : And
2 : Then
2 : I don't know, should I like move?
1 : You're gray right? Um
2 : Yeah
1 : At this point I feel like there's no way of knowing which one of these are going to come up next cause almost all of them are
2 : Yeah I mean I can start to
4 : Yeah, you don't really have to move.
3 : I'd just start heading towards you know
2 : I can start heading towards down here, because they have these three and I have one of those.
1 : Mmhmm.
1 : True.
2 : I guess so I can
3 : Mmhmm.
2 : Second, third.
1 : Mhmm.
3 : Yup.
2 : Ok um and then I
2 : draw two
4 : Two of those cards yeah.
2 : treasure cards
2 : Um ok I got a Sandbag's and another one. So then like my next turn I can give that to you again.
4 : Ok yeah. Or if
3 : And I'll have three of those.
2 : Um and then you'll have three.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mhmm.
2 : And then
4 : Or I can move to you too and oh- no never mind, I guess, no cause you can give it to me.
2 : Oh yeah, that's another
2 : Um
2 : And then I don't have to do the flood thing
4 : No you do, you still do.
3 : No you do.
1 : You do, yeah.
2 : Wait I do? Oh, you still do that even if you don't get
3 : Yeah
2 : The Water's Rise just means that the level goes up, ok.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Wait no first
2 : Do I shuffle?
4 : No no you just
2 : That- Water- ok I'm sorry
3 : Well you s-
4 : Yeah
1 : No, no it's fine
3 : No you still p-
3 : put that back on the
3 : right?
4 : No I think only if you get- that's like that's why it's a bad card because
1 : No this
2 : I think that's only with Water's Rise.
3 : No.
3 : It's only if the Water- ok.
1 : If it floods, yeah.
2 : Ok.
2 : So two
1 : Mhmm.
2 : Lost Lagoon and Phantom Rock.
1 : This one's gone.
3 : and Phantom Rock's gone
2 : Oh ok, so
3 : That's ok
2 : There's that.
4 : Ok
2 : Um
1 : That's it for you I think.
2 : And then I'm done, so
4 : It's your turn, yep
3 : Mhmm.
2 : Alright
3 : It's to me
3 : Then I can move
2 : I mean
3 : anywhere in that-
3 : Yeah that counts as an action but I can only do it once per turn.
2 : You could go
3 : Yeah
2 : and try and shore up some of those
1 : You can always
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah
3 : I could. Um
3 : Seems
3 : Seems to be the only viable thing, actually
4 : (--)
2 : Yeah for now I think we're just trying to stay afloat
3 : So yeah
3 : Move over here and then I will shore up
2 : Mhmm
2 : Ok
3 : This one, and third action shore up that one.
2 : Shore up that one?
2 : Ok
2 : And then you have to draw two.
3 : Draw two
4 : Your two cards.
2 : Ok good. So we have a Helicop- you have two of them, that's good
3 : So I got a Helicopter Lift and
3 : Uh fires
4 : Maybe
4 : Maybe your next turn
1 : Oh hey
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah, so you'll
4 : Probably, yeah
2 : Just like
2 : Keep in mind who we can shift to
2 : Um and then
3 : Mhmm
2 : have to draw two
1 : Wait can he give me that? Or can only you do that?
3 : Mm
2 : He can, but he has to be on the same tile.
4 : He already
4 : He did it as a-
1 : Oh right, ok
3 : Mhmm
4 : Yeah, I think that counts as an action too, so
2 : So
1 : Mhmm
2 : It- yeah, so I mean, possibly next turn.
2 : Depending
3 : Depending on where we move
3 : Alright, Whispering Garden and Cliffs of Abandon
4 : No you should try to move (--)
2 : Um
3 : Which is Whispering?
3 : Howling Garden, Whhispering Garden
2 : Um where are
3 : So there and
1 : And here, this one
2 : Oh, ok.
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Both of us, now we're sinking
4 : Ok
2 : Oh no, alright.
4 : Alright
4 : Um
2 : There's those two
2 : And that's it for you? Alright. So
3 : Yup
4 : Uh ok so
2 : You could
2 : You could
4 : I mean I-
2 : trade him
2 : the Lion card?
2 : Oh wait no you
1 : Wait
1 : You can move diagonally which means you can go here and get
2 : Oh
4 : Yeah.
1 : that.
1 : If you-
4 : Well I have to get like the card don't I? So I-
2 : Yeah you have to get four cards before you can do that.
1 : Oh
4 : Yeah so maybe I might as well just, cause I can flip diagonally so
4 : I could flip those both over
2 : Ok so you can shore up this one?
4 : I don't know, yeah
1 : Mhmm
2 : Well yeah, you could shore up this one and then like move
4 : I guess
4 : I guess at this point there's nothing else to do really.
2 : Until we get like the right cards
2 : You know, to start moving towards these.
2 : Um
3 : You could move to-
3 : Temple of the Moon if like
4 : Ok so that was one
3 : (--)
3 : so take a diagonal action
4 : Two
2 : You could do that and then three, shore up that one
4 : Ok
4 : Hmm
2 : I mean, I don't really
4 : Yeah I guess no one really has
2 : have a better idea.
2 : I think we're just waiting to get the tr-
4 : Oh yeah
2 : like right amount of treasure cards
4 : Can you
2 : ok so
4 : give me two?
2 : Yup.
3 : Hmm (--)
4 : Ok
2 : Ok and you have five
4 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : We'll have to be
3 : Any more cards has to be
4 : Yup
3 : discarded.
2 : yeah, so we'll have to be mindful of that. And then
2 : two
4 : Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate
2 : Ok.
2 : Oh, no no
1 : Wait
2 : those go back over here
4 : Ok
1 : Oh right here
3 : Mhmm
4 : It's your turn.
2 : Ok.
1 : Ok
1 : It's weird- I keep expecting to like roll a dice, but ok
2 : I know
2 : right?
1 : Um
4 : You're red.
2 : You're red, so
1 : So anything, really
1 : I can go here
2 : Yeah you're- and then
1 : and then
2 : There and
2 : flip that.
1 : Yeah, ok. So one, two
4 : Or- ok.
2 : One, two, three.
1 : three
1 : Thank you
2 : Ok
2 : Oh no
1 : No!
2 : Level three
1 : So
1 : And then shuffle these right?
3 : Mhmm
3 : It's-
2 : Yeah
3 : Discard Water's Rise too.
2 : Yeah. Here I'll take that, you shuffle those
1 : Oh yeah
2 : Ok and then draw three
1 : Ok Breaker's Bridge
1 : Um Cliffs of Abandon
4 : (--) so we can move them faster
1 : and Whispering Garden
3 : Which is over there, yeah.
2 : Ok
2 : And then put those there, and then
4 : Ok where are you, ok
2 : That's it?
1 : That's it
2 : Ok, so
1 : Mhmm
4 : Yeah you might wanna
2 : I can sh-
4 : FLip over at least that one, maybe.
2 : Yeah
3 : You get the Sandbag that you can shore
2 : Yeah but I might as well save that for now
3 : to any
3 : Well yeah, any tile on the island. You're right
2 : Y- yeah
2 : Well, or I could
3 : While you're, while you're-
2 : flip it for that
2 : cause we know
3 : Well while you're, while you're adjacent you might as well not.
2 : yeah, so
4 : Yeah, I wouldn't waste that.
2 : flip that and then I could flip this one too cause I'm on it
4 : That's one
4 : Or, ok well, yeah
2 : or, do you think I should move somewhere?
3 : Either-
3 : Be-
4 : I guess, I don't know. We should probably start trying to
3 : Get treasure
1 : Get
4 : do something other than
2 : Yeah.
4 : But I guess you don't really have any cards anyway, so.
3 : Well you wanted to, hm
2 : Um
2 : and
3 : I was gonna say you wanted to trade some of that but,
2 : Yeah, but then she doesn't have
2 : I could trade
3 : Yeah we don't want to put, yeah.
4 : Ok, where are you? Where are you-
2 : you one of these, but you already have the
2 : red fire ones, so I'm thinking she can trade you
4 : Alright
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah. I'll move, I'll move to you and give you, um, my card on my turn.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Ok
2 : the next turn
2 : um, and then ne-
4 : And you should- where are you at?
3 : I'm the
3 : Blue guy, way over there.
4 : Oh.
4 : I was gonna say, cause you should give her
2 : Cause-
2 : Yeah. If you give her a fire, and she gives her a fire she'll have-
4 : a card.
2 : four, and then you could discard one that wouldn't really matter.
1 : Mhmm
1 : Yeah, true.
2 : You know?
2 : Um, ok.
4 : Or we could wait a whole nother time around, but
2 : Should I, move like down?
2 : I guess
1 : Yeah why not
2 : Ok.
2 : So that's that turn, um
2 : Another one of those, and another Sandbag. So I'm full on cards.
2 : And I have to do three
2 : So Iton Gate, so that's now sunk, and there's that card. Temple of the Moon
4 : You could even, where are you at?
2 : and Lost Lagoon.
1 : I'm here.
4 : Where is the fire one? Oh you're kinda far
4 : No- mm
1 : What were you thinking?
4 : I was gonna say, you could use your Helicopter and give her that and then I could give her it
3 : Somebody can move
4 : But-
1 : That's true.
4 : She wouldn't- you're so far away from like the fire anyways so
1 : Mhmm
2 : Well-
2 : If you did that, one, two, three
3 : I could move her to the fire
4 : Yeah but then she- it
4 : takes a card to- oh true.
2 : You could move her to the fire
3 : I could move her to the fire thing and then give
2 : W-
4 : And then you could move yourself and then give her one
2 : And you can do that on her turn cause that's used any time right?
4 : Give-
2 : Ok, so then
4 : Yeah.
4 : Well, he, that's also his power too, so
2 : Ok so then why don't you fly to her
2 : and give her the fire
2 : one of them
4 : Wait
2 : so she-
3 : Yeah
4 : You, why are you moving? Do you have-
2 : Because, he's the pilot s o he can
4 : You have to be on the same card to give- Ok.
3 : Yeah I can
2 : Yeah, so he can move to her
3 : Yeah, to give cards I can
2 : I'm the only one who can give to anybody, and then
4 : Ok that's one move.
2 : two would be giving her that
3 : Mhmm
3 : Yep
3 : Yeah to red fire. That's right
1 : Mhmm.
2 : Yep
2 : And that gives you five
1 : Yeah.
2 : But, if she gives you the other one, just get rid of another one
4 : Yeah.
1 : Discard one of these, yeah
2 : Um, and then
3 : Mhmm, and then I can do
3 : Helicopter Lift to take
2 : To move her
2 : Both of you
3 : both of us to fire.
2 : So, either Cave of Shadows or,
4 : Yeah that's good
2 : Ok yeah, that's good.
4 : Alright so
2 : So then, draw two
3 : And then I draw two
3 : Two more treasure cards.
4 : and three
2 : Ok
3 : And then three
3 : of these guys.
3 : Which is Copper Gate, Crimson Forest
4 : Yeah
4 : What's the other one? Just cause we're being timed
3 : Crimson
3 : And Howling Garden.
2 : Ok.
4 : Ok, so
4 : Where am I? Here?
4 : I guess I'll one, two, give you a card
1 : Ok
2 : Ok.
4 : Everyone agree with that?
2 : Yeah.
1 : Mhmm
2 : Yup.
3 : Mhmm
2 : And then give her the fire and then you can get rid of-
1 : Do I have to get rid of one randomly? Or can I get rid of whichever I want?
3 : Is to discard
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah I guess just- there's so many so I wouldn't-
2 : I think, it doesn't matter I don't think. He can pick which one.
4 : I think you can pick
1 : Ok
2 : Ok, so
4 : Um, yeah I guess that
2 : So then yeah, now you have four
4 : probably be the best one to get rid of
4 : Although, oh well whatever.
1 : Mhmm
3 : And so now I'm-
2 : So then now get rid of all four of those and
1 : So
3 : Seizes a treasure
2 : Do you
2 : Yeah and then you get that one, I think.
3 : Mhmm
1 : Yay!
4 : Um that was only
2 : Alright.
1 : and then
4 : that was only one move right?
3 : Yeah, to dis- yeah
2 : Yep.
1 : I-
4 : You should- oh you can't flip
1 : ok.
1 : LAthough it's not-
4 : Hmm
1 : Is it my- was that my turn?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, so like
1 : Ok.
2 : Seize a treasure
1 : Ok.
2 : Capture a treasure, yeah that's one move.
4 : Yeah, maybe move and then flip one of those over just cause, I don't know
1 : Ok.
4 : What else
2 : Yeah, or
1 : Um,
2 : If you move here
2 : Oh no you can't
2 : do
2 : diagonal flipping
1 : Nhmm
2 : But you could still flip one of 'em.
1 : Yeah
4 : Whichever- yeah
2 : You know like flip baper- Breaker's Bridge back over or something.
1 : I can just do
1 : Ok
4 : That's good so, two cards
3 : And then draw
2 : Ok.
2 : Um
3 : (--)
2 : Yeah, draw two
3 : Oh yay
1 : Every time
2 : It's ok we're still on three, so
2 : And
1 : And then
2 : shuffle
1 : Yeah
2 : nd put the Water's Rise card in the discard.
4 : I guess you might as well discard the fire one too since we don't need it anymore.
4 : Just so you're empty you've-
1 : That's true
3 : Yep
2 : Yeah
1 : And then
1 : ok
1 : Whispering Garden
1 : Temple of the Moon and Lost Lagoon.
2 : Oh no! Alright
2 : So we'll have to make sure Temple of the Sun doesn't sink cause that's the only other-
3 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Ok
2 : um Chalice one
1 : Oh wait and Lost Lagoon, did we get that one?
2 : Or
2 : Earth Globe or whatever it was
2 : L-
3 : Wait what was the third one?
4 : Yeah, yeah.
1 : Lost Lagoon? Oh, bye bye
2 : well L-lost
2 : Ok so that sinks also
3 : Lost Lagoon.
4 : Oh I-
3 : Then I need
3 : Lost Lagoon in the
2 : Oh, yeah
1 : Yeah.
3 : Alright
3 : Good.
2 : There you go
1 : Wasn't there another one that sank?
2 : Ok.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Oh
3 : Temple of the Moon
4 : You already got it
2 : Sorry.
2 : Alright.
3 : Yep
2 : Um, that's it
2 : And I have two Sandbag cards, do you want me to play any of those? Cause both of these are
4 : Yeah probably
3 : Dan- in danger, yeah.
2 : Do you want me to just do one or both of them?
2 : Or maybe save one if we really need it
3 : Do-
4 : Um
1 : Mm
1 : Save one , I think
2 : Ok.
4 : I mean, yeah.
2 : Ok, so I guess I'll just do Whispering-
2 : Garden cause we're closer to that.
2 : And, um
4 : So that's one turn, right?
2 : So that's one, yeah.
2 : Wait no because that doesn't count as it
4 : Wait no it's not, it's not, it's not, yeah
2 : Ok.
2 : So
2 : Is there any reason for me-
1 : You can start heading that way.
2 : Like I could do, one, two, flip that
1 : Yeah
2 : I guess.
4 : Yeah maybe, or, ok.
2 : And three.
4 : I was gonna say, alright that's fine.
4 : No that's fine. I was gonna say maybe, I mean you're still close to that.
2 : Do you have, that's good
2 : Cause I wanna stay close to these. Um ok so then draw two
4 : Yeah
4 : Just cause you have-
2 : Which
2 : I'm not gonna be able to keep
3 : No you just-
4 : Yeah
4 : I mean-
3 : You-
3 : One
2 : Or wait- or should I tr-
1 : You have four, you only have four right now.
4 : Yeah, no she has six.
4 : What are those two?
2 : Helicopter Lift
1 : But you can just discard whichever you don't wannt
4 : Yeah, just
4 : Does it add-
4 : Yeah.
4 : I'd discard maybe
4 : The Chalice since I have two of these
2 : Ok
4 : But do you guys agree with that?
1 : Sure it looks like we're about equal with both of them
2 : Yeah, on them
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Um and then
4 : Aw man
2 : Three
4 : Ok, I was gonna say
4 : cause I could-
2 : I should've traded you
2 : Like
2 : Cause I'm the Messenger and I don't have to be on the same tile, I could've traded you some of
4 : Oh.
2 : or one of my
3 : Send one of these over, yeah.
4 : Oh do you not have any, ok yeah.
2 : I don't know if we're allowed to back track
4 : But I don't think- just go ahead.
2 : Yeah, ok. One, two, three
2 : Howling Gardens
2 : Oh good, cause I just flipped that back over
3 : (--)
4 : Cool.
2 : Um, Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Breaker's Bridge- ok good.
3 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Alright. Next
3 : Alright
4 : Hmm
3 : Ok, um
2 : I mean you can trade her either one of these
2 : Or one of those
2 : If you get on the same
3 : Right. Well I am
4 : And that's good if- cause she can give it to me at any time, so
2 : Then I can give you, and then- so which one do we wanna do?
4 : Where are you at?
3 : Well actually yeah. I could, I could go, I could go to her and- no I'm, I'm on her, so yeah.
4 : You're the blue, ok
2 : Yeah
2 : So
4 : I'm green, I'm blue so yeah that works good
2 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
3 : So I can already
2 : Yeah so that's one
3 : S-
3 : Give
3 : One
2 : And then
3 : And then I can move somehwere to save something I suppose
4 : Yeah that's probably a good idea
2 : Yeah, um
2 : Do you wanna
2 : Ugh
3 : And then I could move somebody else with the- course that doesn't, yeah it doesn't count as an action. I keep forgetting that
1 : If you moved here you could get both of those
2 : Except he can't do two, you're the only one who can.
1 : Oh, never mind.
2 : But
2 : You could still move here and do one of those two
3 : I could move
2 : Or you can move anywhere
4 : We should probably try to- We should probably try to stay close together though just with exchanging cards I mean we don't need this, we don't really need it so
2 : Yeah
2 : Just because with changing cards and we're close to all of these
2 : Yeah
2 : So maybe like, get one of these because that's the path to
4 : And
2 : That
4 : Yeah
3 : I guess so
2 : Ok
3 : Sounds ok
3 : So move here and then
2 : And then sh-
4 : Wait you can't move diagonal
2 : He can because he's the pilot so he can fly
3 : Yeah, I can fly wherever
2 : He has one turn, yeah.
3 : As a-
4 : Oh that counts as a trun
3 : As a flight- yeah as a flight move not a
2 : Yeah so that's a flight
4 : So you gave a card, and you're flying somewhere and you're flipping, ok.
2 : And then you're flipping it
3 : Flying somewhere and then flipping and
2 : Yeah. So then you draw two. Oh, wow sorry
3 : I'm good
4 : Doesn't really make a difference
2 : Oh, well that's good
3 : That's helpful
4 : Eh well it's (--)
1 : Nice
1 : So I can later
2 : Yeah you can, ok.
1 : Yeah
4 : Hm
3 : Then I have a full deck and then three Flood Cards, yes thank you.
2 : And then three
2 : What do we got?
3 : Copper Gate which goes out
2 : That's gone.
3 : Crimson Forst which
2 : Is there, so that's also gone
3 : Is there and that's also out
2 : We're like shrinking slowly
3 : and the Cave of Embers, so that needs to be preserved.
2 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Right
2 : Alright
4 : Um, I don't know if I should
2 : (--)
4 : Give these?
4 : I could move to you
4 : And then give you two
3 : But then she wouldn't be able to take two
4 : Oh true, true, that is true
2 : Yeah
3 : But you could discard a Sandbag or Helicopter Lift
2 : Yeah because I'm gonna, I could
4 : You could do that
1 : None of you can taxe two though
1 : at this point.
4 : Yeah so it's like
2 : Well I could do that and discard, cause I only need to give you one of these
2 : for you to have four, so I could discard one of these
4 : That is true
2 : and
4 : You could easily use- yeah. You could use that
1 : Oh yeah
2 : one of the-
2 : Or I can use this anytime so I can use it now
3 : Without counting as an action
4 : Yeah.
1 : No you don't even have to
2 : Without it counting as a turn
1 : Cause you don't even have to cause you could discard that and then trade that
4 : Yeah but it's my turn and I have to pull two cards so
1 : for that
2 : Yeah.
1 : Oh
2 : Yeah.
2 : Do you want me to do that?
2 : And then I'll have three of those, he'll have three of those, and you'll have three of those
4 : Yeah, ok so move one, I'm moving towards you?
2 : Ok, so which one?
4 : So
2 : Maybe I'll just flip this back over?
4 : Yeah sure
2 : Ok
2 : Um that goes in discard
4 : Ok and then I'm gonna give you, that's two.
2 : I give you one and
2 : And then three you can give me the
4 : Yeah
2 : Other one and I'll discard this
4 : Yeah, ok
4 : That's good
2 : And then I'll give you the third one on my turn
4 : Yeap, one
2 : Ok so
2 : Two
2 : We're gettin there
4 : Ok, um
1 : Ok, so
2 : And we only need to have three of the four treasures also
4 : Three water cards
1 : Yeah
2 : So
4 : Three of the water
2 : We-
1 : Flood- Flood Cards
2 : Oh, yeah
4 : Ok
4 : Oh sorry.
2 : Dunes of Deception and
1 : That's ok
3 : and the Coral Palace
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so
1 : First action is gonna be this
4 : And you
3 : Give to- no but I, cause I have
2 : And wait are you on the same space as him? You have to be on the same space
1 : Oh, I forgot about that sorry
3 : Yeah
2 : Uh
1 : Ok so then the first action I should go near you
3 : Then I would have- and I have five cards anyways so I would need to
4 : Where are you?
2 : I can lift you there
1 : Wait wait I can jusst
4 : I mean you can get rid of
1 : No no no I'm right here look
4 : You might as well get rid of that cause I'm gonna give her that.
3 : You could get rid of the- get rid of the Lion
1 : Guys, I'm right here, I can just go
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Just one, yeah
3 : Ok
1 : And then
3 : So move one, and then
2 : And then, do that, and then for your third you can flip both of those back over cause you're the Engineer
1 : Two
3 : And then give, I discard that
1 : Three
4 : Good, good.
3 : So I have sufficient to seize a treasure and then
3 : We did
3 : You did your third?
3 : I wasn't looking. Ok
1 : Uh
1 : Yep I did three so now I need two of those
2 : Yeah, so now two of those
3 : Yup
3 : Nice and convenient
2 : And three of these
1 : Mhmm
1 : Uh Temple of the Sun, Tidal Palace, Bronze Gate
2 : Tidal Palace
4 : Yeah you might as well get rid of the fire one too
4 : Cause you don't need- yeah.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah neither of these are useful now, but
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
4 : It's your turn
2 : Ok so my turn um
2 : I'm gonna give you this
4 : Ok and I'm gonna discard this
2 : Ok
3 : Shoop
2 : And
2 : Then
2 : Where am I at?
4 : You're gray
2 : I could just move here and flip that
2 : To
2 : keep it there
4 : Yeah that's good
2 : Ok
2 : And that's my turn so draw two
2 : Oh no ok, Water's Rise.
3 : Yay!
2 : Still in three here
1 : Alright
2 : And I have to shuffle all of these
4 : I'm nervous
2 : It's hard because then you keep having to flip the same ones
3 : Exactly that's how- Mhmm
2 : It's uh part of- yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Part of the
2 : Intrigue
2 : Alright
2 : Um, ok. Cave of Embers, Temple of the Sun, and Silver Gate.
2 : So Silver Gate is gone.
4 : Cave of Em-
4 : bers
3 : Cave of Embers is gone, yeah.
2 : Cave of Embers
1 : Temple of the Sun?
2 : And Silv- oops, sorry. Silver Gate, I already flipped
3 : Oh wait we don't need this anymore cause we already got the fire so, yeah, who cares
1 : Oh.
2 : And Silver Gate
2 : Ok.
2 : And then put that there.
2 : Alright so I'm done?
2 : Alright so you can do
4 : Yep.
3 : Seems like it. Yeah so, I can move- well I just move to a space and then I can move wherever.
2 : Seize a tr-
4 : Oh you have to be on the thing. Ok yeah, you're right there so- wait are you? Yeah, you're blue.
2 : You ha- yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah so you're blue right?
3 : Mhmm
2 : Ok, so that-
2 : That's one
3 : To move there
4 : So I'd say get the treasure and flip-
2 : and then two, you get the treasure
3 : And seize the treasure is two
2 : And then
3 : And then
4 : And
4 : Probably flip something over
3 : Third action
2 : You can flip Cliffs of Abandon, I guess?
3 : Or- yeah, can flip Cliffs of-
1 : But don't-
4 : Might as well.
1 : we still need that
4 : I got it,
1 : Oh, ok.
4 : though. Yeah, I'll be the- oh oh, oh
2 : Before- yeah
4 : Oh.
2 : Unless-
1 : You're not
1 : on it though.
4 : Do you have a Sandbag- does anyone have a Sandbag?
3 : Unless it gets-
2 : No.
3 : Unless it gets flooded
4 : Dang.
4 : Yeah that would be bad
2 : Yeah cause that's the only one
4 : Well you can't-
1 : Do we have to wait for the Lion one
3 : Or we could just get this guy. Yeah. I mean if we lose this we-
4 : It's- there's nothing you can do anyway can you? That's true
2 : That's true because if you lose that then I have three, so
3 : Lose this, get this, so yeah.
4 : True, that's true, yeah.
2 : Alright.
3 : Either way.
2 : Ok.
3 : So, yeah.
4 : It's not that big of a deal
3 : Shore up-
2 : Ok, cool.
3 : Take two,
3 : I got this guy and this guy,
2 : And then
3 : and then
4 : I'm nervous
2 : three
2 : Oh good.
3 : Dunes of Deception
2 : Tidal Palace is now gone.
3 : Tidal Palace is gone.
4 : I got the hand, ok.
3 : And Coral Palace is flooded.
4 : I'm gonna move
2 : Ok.
2 : So-
4 : I'm gonna move here.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Wait can you move diagonal?
4 : Yeah I'm the Explorer. I'm gonna get- get the treasure.
2 : You're the Explorer? Ok just wanted to make sure.
2 : Ok.
2 : So now we have three treasures so we all need to head to Fool's Landing.
4 : Yeah.
3 : Mhmm.
4 : And so now I'm gonna- where do these go? Over there?
2 : Over here, yeah.
3 : Hmm, yeah.

1 : Ok.
2 : Alright.

2 : treasure- oh wait
3 : Oh we forgot the flood cards.
4 : Oh yeah, I didn't do that
4 : Ok I have a Sandbag. I guess I'll use it now
2 : Oh, you can use it to flip
2 : well
4 : (--)
2 : Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, sorry, yeah that's fine.
4 : What
4 : I mean that's closest to that, so
2 : Um, yeah
2 : And
4 : And the water
2 : and then three flood cards.
2 : Uh Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon
2 : and something else.
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Breaker's Bridge. I think that's already gone, isn't it?
2 : Maybe it is, maybe we just forgot
1 : Whispering Garden
4 : Ah-
4 : Take another card then
2 : Ok.
1 : Wait-
2 : Oh no, it's there. You flipped it?
3 : Oh no there it is.
1 : Yeah I flipped these two. Where are Cliff- where's Cliffs of Abandon though?
4 : Oh ok.
3 : Oh yeah.
2 : Right here, so
1 : Oh, ok.
1 : So that's gone.
4 : No I just flipped that
2 : You just flipped that, ok.
3 : It's gone.
3 : And (--) ok.
4 : Yeah.
2 : It was upside down, so
3 : Yup.
4 : Alright so now it's your turn. So yeah, move towards it.
2 : Alright, yeah now it's your turn
1 : Ok.
1 : Ok, so
2 : Ok, so
2 : One, two
4 : One, two
1 : Um
1 : Should I flip something just in case someone ends up there or
4 : I mean no one's there, so no one's gonna end up there
2 : You can move one, flip and then
3 : No one's in that direction
2 : if you want.
4 : If you want- if you- that makes you feel better, but
1 : Ok one,
1 : It does, it does.
1 : Um, ok.
2 : You could do both of them because you're the
2 : Engineer.
2 : I mean, not that it matters, ok.
1 : That's true, ok.
4 : Might as well, whatever.
1 : Um, orange please
2 : Two
2 : Ok.
1 : Alright.
1 : And
1 : Misty Marsh, Howling Garden, Bronze Gate.
4 : Misty Marsh
3 : Bronze Gate
4 : Did you say Bronze Gate?
2 : Yeah, ok so that one's gone.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Where's Howling Garden?
2 : He already got it, it was down there.
1 : Oh, ok.
3 : Mhmm.
4 : (--)
3 : So just need the
4 : So
3 : Bronze Gate.
4 : Bronze Gate.
3 : Yup.
2 : Alright. And then that's it for you?
4 : Alright your-
2 : Ok. So I'll move one, two
2 : Done.
3 : Mhmm.
2 : So, draw two.
2 : Dang it
4 : Just- get rid of 'em, just get rid of 'em. Discard those two.
2 : Ok, well
2 : Just, yeah.
4 : Yeah, alright
2 : This is not working. Ok
2 : Water's Rise.
3 : Ugh
2 : That'll go up and then shuffle.
1 : We're up to four.
4 : Quick, quick
2 : I'm trying, ok.
2 : Um one, two, three, four.
2 : Misty Marsh, Howling Garden
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : and Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Misty Marsh is gone.
1 : Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Howling Garden's gone.
2 : Howling Garden, Misty Marsh, and Breaker's Bridge.
4 : Alright
4 : Your turn.
2 : Ok.
3 : It's gone? Bris- Breaker's Bridge? Or-
4 : No go ahead.
1 : No I just flipped it. It's uh flooded.
2 : Oh, ok.
3 : Just flipped it so- joop
2 : Sorry.
2 : Alright.
2 : And your turn so you can just fly there.
3 : I can- well no I've
3 : here
2 : Or- go there.
3 : Fly here, I use my Helicopter Lift and then you use your Helicopter Lift and we win.
2 : Oh and then I can use mine to-
4 : Yeah, good.
4 : Woo!
2 : Alright.
2 : Done.
2 : Good call.

1 : Ok so I'm going to start with an action, I like the way they
1 : h-had that in the practice, so I think I'm gonna move
1 : actually I'm gonna flip these two first, and then I'm gonna
1 : move up and flip those two and that'll be three turns.
2 : Sounds great.
1 : I think.
2 : Good job Engineer.
1 : Thanks
3 : Wow
1 : Alright and then now I pick up
1 : two of these
1 : Nope two of those
3 : Two
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Two treasure cards
1 : Ok
1 : And we have the Water Rising so I have to
1 : do that real quick
1 : and so I move up one tick
1 : shuffle the discard
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yup
1 : K
1 : Put it back on top
1 : And
1 : this goes in there
1 : Oh uh over there thank you.
2 : Mhmm.
1 : Alright
1 : Um and then
1 : Now I have to draw flood cards
3 : You've got to yeah.
1 : That's the last.
2 : Great
1 : Yeah so I draw two
1 : We have Phantom Rock, if you guys want to help me out
1 : Oh ok so that's gone
3 : Oh that
3 : That's gone then.
2 : What?
1 : as well as this card and then Breaking, Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Ok
1 : Is there and then there's that
1 : Alright.
2 : Alright.
2 : So
3 : There was nothing on Phantom Rock
2 : Do up to three actions
2 : And gray
2 : So we have that, we have that over there.
2 : One action is move to Whispering Winds
1 : Ok
2 : I'm gonna shore up Breaker's Bridge
3 : Nice.
1 : Alright
2 : And I will
2 : Move to
1 : Here
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
2 : Take my two actions
2 : And
1 : Might as well
2 : Take my flood cards
1 : Ok
2 : Not sure if we need to keep saying it out loud but
1 : No that's fine
2 : Golden Gate is gone
3 : Sometimes that helps
2 : And Lost Lagoon
3 : Ok
1 : flipped
2 : flip
1 : Alright
3 : Ok my turn
2 : Pilot
3 : So I should probably use my special power don't you think to go
3 : All the way over to Lost Lagoon cause it's the only one that's shored
3 : Uh that's flippped over
1 : Yup that makes sense.
2 : Or you could be adjacent to it and still shore it
2 : as well.
3 : Right but I'm not
3 : Thats makes sense right?
2 : Mmhmm. And then you're gonna
3 : Ok
1 : Yup
3 : Yeah and flip it.
2 : Ok
1 : And that was using your special power not the Helicopter
3 : Correct my special power
1 : Copter lift, ok
1 : So that was two turns?
2 : Great so you have one more action if you choose to.
1 : Two actions
3 : So does it make sense to move back over so I'm closer to another
3 : pawn?
3 : That way we could get together if we needed to use.
2 : Sure but then the first action
3 : (--)
1 : Sure
1 : do we have any cards that
1 : it's not really worth sharing too much right now
2 : Right
3 : Mm no
1 : Ok
1 : So
1 : Your pick. I would stay somewhere in the middle.
3 : Ok
3 : So maybe move over one
1 : Yeah
1 : Sure (over there)
3 : Ok
2 : So you could have used your special power flown there, but we're learning still
3 : Yeah ok now I need to pick
2 : Alright
1 : Alright
2 : Two treasure cards
3 : (Oh I got the) Helicopter Lift
2 : K
3 : That and two
2 : There's your Floods
3 : Ok we gotta flood Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
2 : Oh I'm on it
3 : Which is there
3 : And Whispering Garden
2 : Whispering Garden
1 : Ok
2 : Good pull
3 : Ok
1 : Alright and then, then you need two of these
2 : I think the Engineer
2 : Shoot yeah sh
3 : That's what I just did
1 : Oh oh ok you already did that
1 : Alright
2 : So I think your first move to shore those up
3 : Guess I'm good.
1 : Yup
1 : yup that makes sense um
1 : although
1 : ah
1 : Quesiton
1 : Can I
1 : do these two at the same time?
2 : Yes cause that's your move, that's your special
1 : ok
1 : Ok
1 : I wasn't sure if the
3 : Sweet
1 : adjacent
1 : and the one you're on
1 : Counts as one or two. But I th
1 : I'm pretty sure that's one.
2 : Yup, shore up any two for one action.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : Um so that's my first
1 : um
1 : Let's see do you think you want this?
2 : Ch, ch, cho
1 : (Dude) would that be useful to you?
2 : Um, I think let's go around one more time to see if anyone's
1 : ok
1 : Alright
1 : So that'll be my end of that, of my turn
3 : Ok
1 : Um so now I'll pick up
2 : So no movement? Ok.
1 : Pick two of those. Got a fire.
1 : Alright and that's my top five.
1 : Um and now I have to pick up two of these
1 : Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon
3 : Iron Gate
2 : Temple
1 : Ok
1 : And those are discarded.
2 : And it's my turn. Ok, three actions.
2 : I'm gonna go
2 : to Misty Marsh
2 : Shore up Temple of the Moon
1 : Alright
2 : And
1 : So that's two
2 : Move to Temple of the Moon
1 : Ok
2 : And hopes
1 : Yup
3 : Yeah (lemme pull it)
1 : Good plan
2 : Raise the water, oh you go it?
1 : Alright
1 : yeah I got it
2 : Ok shuffle these
2 : Put them on top, discard this
2 : And now I take my flood cards cause I took my action cards, one, two, three
1 : Yeah
1 : Three now?
3 : Yup
2 : And we have Temple of the Moon
1 : ok
2 : Whispering Gardens
1 : Ok
2 : And Breaker's Bridge
3 : Breaker's Bridge
3 : Was that already out?
2 : Looks like
2 : A bridge
3 : Well, where is it?
2 : Breaker's Bridge, right there
1 : Oh
3 : Ah
1 : Right in front of us ok.
1 : Alright?
1 : Is that it?
2 : Yup
2 : Pilot
3 : Ok so I am over there
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Ooo
1 : If
1 : I need four
1 : and you have one.
3 : So I should
1 : Um
3 : Give that to you?
2 : You have to be on the same tile in order to do that though.
1 : May-
1 : Yes and then at some point I would need to get to a Fire which I think is one, two, three, or one, two, three.
2 : Either here
3 : Yeah
1 : Um there's gotta be a full move for me.
1 : So if you move
1 : to Whispering Garden
3 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : I don't know are we trying to salvage these two? Probably two?
2 : Yeah my thought though is if she passes you the card
1 : Then my m-
2 : You could lose the goblet on your turn, sure-shore those up and we could get you the lift at any time and get you to that real fast.
1 : Ok but that would have to be used by you.
3 : Ok
2 : Right cause you, you got two.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok so we'll do that on the next round so
2 : Or sh-
2 : So you need to
1 : So should move
2 : actually
1 : unless you have
2 : If she shore's it up
1 : a better idea.
1 : Yeah shore up that one
2 : Then
2 : And then go here and it won't affect you because you could do two anyways, but
2 : Yeah you'll have to get to that
2 : Ah his square in order to give him the card though. You have to be on the same square.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok so shore that up
1 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Correct
1 : And you want to move
3 : Yup
1 : So that's your turn, action two and then
2 : That's the uh fire card.
1 : Pass the, the fire?
3 : Sure. There you go
1 : And then this goes to discard
1 : Over there
2 : Treasure yeah
3 : Yup
1 : Ok and that's three turns
2 : Correct
3 : Yup
3 : So then two cards?
2 : Two actions
3 : Let's see
3 : Ok
1 : Alright
3 : So get
3 : One of these which I'll eventually get to use those Sandbags
1 : Yup
3 : I can use that now or should I save it?
1 : Um
1 : Well i-it's gonna take me
1 : three moves to move over there right? Cause it's one, two, three?
3 : ok
1 : So
1 : might as well
1 : use a Sandbag unless you
1 : I mean the
3 : Well do I want to save that because he's gonna get those things so it doesn't go
2 : R- R-
3 : down?
1 : I would save
2 : I-
1 : I would save the
2 : I would save
2 : the ones with the treasure. This is worthless.
1 : Hmm
1 : o-
3 : Right that doesn't matter.
1 : O-or the yeah or the one in the middle
1 : Um because if the one on the outside is lost, you can always swim to shore.
1 : Um but if the one in the middle is lost then you have to go around and it's a pain
2 : You have to go around. Right.
3 : True
1 : Um so if you're gonna use it to save one, I would save this one.
2 : Whispering Winds. Right. Cause if
1 : Uh- Unless well actually
3 : (alright)
2 : If you think one of these three is a Whispering Winds.
1 : Ah unless you want me to use my first turn on the next one to save this and move two and get
2 : It could be lost
1 : closeish
2 : well remember these aren't actions so she could fly you there immediately after you.
1 : Oh right.
1 : Ok
1 : So
1 : Forget it save
1 : this, save this one
2 : mm
2 : Unless if you think
3 : Well that's what I was thinking because you have these cards
2 : Unless if one of these three is a whispering winds, then we've lost that
1 : Oh
1 : true
1 : Yeah (mine's old), you want to use it?
2 : Go ahead
2 : Sandbag it.
2 : Did you already use your three actions?
3 : Well no you can use this any time.
1 : But it doesn't count.
2 : Right, right.
1 : yeah
3 : So I'm just saying cause you have two of these
2 : Right
3 : That we probably want to save that.
1 : Right
3 : Ok so yes
1 : Sure, that's fine.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok and this goes which discard pile.
1 : Treasure yep.
3 : Ok
1 : Now you'd
3 : Next my three
1 : Alright, luck, luck, luck.
3 : Let's see
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : Ok
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
2 : Cliffs
3 : And Iron Gate
2 : Iron Gate's gone
2 : And the Garden also
1 : Ok
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Alright Cliffs Abandon
1 : What does it look like?
2 : Yeah these's a picture
3 : Here you go
2 : There it is
1 : Ok thank you. Here, I got it.
2 : Alright
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : Alright good call and I'm glad we lost that card cause it was useless I think, right
3 : ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Right
2 : So
2 : I like the peripheal idea
1 : um
2 : Ok so you're first action should be to shore those two up. In the middle
1 : Yup
2 : We could play this any time.
2 : So now fly him.
1 : But does it have to be
1 : Played on your turn?
3 : Played any time does not count as an action.
2 : Nope
2 : Anytime
2 : So let's fly him to
1 : Ok cool.
3 : Yep.
2 : a fire one.
3 : You wanna go here or there or where do you wanna go?
1 : Ok
1 : Whatever
2 : Yeah
1 : That works
3 : Does that make sense for me to move at all or stay where I am?
2 : Cause that
1 : Ok
2 : Ah cause you're allowed to go with him.
1 : Oh do, did you want to fly with me?
3 : Yeah
3 : I don't know do we see a point in it?
2 : I think it's better to spread out because if we start getting flips we could start shoring up so that'll cost that
1 : Right
3 : Ok so I need to get rid of that.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok and
2 : So now your second action will be
2 : taking the treasure
1 : will be to
1 : take the treasure so I assume I just
1 : Go like that
2 : Now we
2 : discard these?
1 : These are discarded.
2 : Err
2 : which
2 : can't ask them?
2 : This pile?
1 : I think it's
3 : Should we look at the rules? I mean.
1 : yeah yeah, they- they probably go in there cause they have to go into the pile.
2 : Ok
2 : Ok they're in there.
3 : (--)
1 : Ok and
2 : And you have one more action
1 : My
1 : I think that's, that's all I should do right?
1 : Good enough
2 : Do you not want to start moving towards this maybe to shore it up or towards the center like your original strategy?
1 : Oh sure yeah. Um I'll move one, that's fine
3 : Yeah that makes sense.
1 : Um thank you, two.
2 : Here you go.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Alright
2 : And three floods.
1 : Oh
1 : And three of those, ok.
1 : So I might want to get this to you and so maybe we should
2 : (oh)
3 : Yeah
1 : convene somewhere in the middle there.
3 : Ok.
1 : Unless these are flooded, um.
1 : So Howling Garden, if you wanna help me out there. Crimson Forest
3 : Howling Garden
2 : Howling Gar-
2 : Right here, Crimson Forest.
1 : and Copper Gate.
2 : Copper Gate.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok and those go in there.
2 : Excellent.
3 : Ok
1 : Alright, done.
2 : Alright
1 : You're up
2 : So
2 : Don't have these cards right now, so I'm going to move to Crimson Forest and just shore these two up.
1 : Ok
2 : For my three turns.
2 : or three actions.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Makes sense
2 : Got my two action cards
2 : That's the water one.
3 : Oh no
1 : Ok do you want me to, you want me to raise you one?
2 : Shuffle these.
2 : Oh I already did yeah.
1 : Oh ok cool.
1 : Ok put those back on and that card goes in.
2 : On the top this goes in there, take three still.
3 : Mm
2 : I got Whispering Gardens.
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : I was here? No you were here. Ok.
1 : And the Cliffs
2 : Cli-
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : got it
2 : Nice looks like you got a lot of shoring up to do.
3 : Mm k.
1 : Ok
1 : Yup, yeah no that'll be fine.
2 : Alright and I'm done with my turn.
3 : Ok so
3 : Where should I
1 : I would
3 : Anywhere should
3 : go?
3 : I mean
1 : Ay- I think we're trying to convene up here now.
3 : Cause I could
3 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : So may
3 : So to start shoring up
1 : I- I would
1 : Yeah cause on my next turn I could move up and I could shore these three
2 : You could shore
2 : Yeah you could move one and then shore two, (--) oh right you could move two actions.
1 : Yeah
1 : Um so maybe if you shore up
1 : This one and then start moving?
2 : Wait wait, with three turns though you could shore those two, move one and then shore those two. So three turns you could shore all four of those up.
1 : Oh that's fair. Ok might as well move. Move.
2 : Which means don't use any of them to shore up unless if you think it's in the pull.
3 : Ok that makes sense.
2 : But you don't know which of the four is in the pull
3 : I don't know which of them
2 : So yes
3 : And then we don't want to lose
1 : Oh here
2 : (well)
3 : This one because this one has one of the
1 : w-w-
1 : which
1 : well it
1 : it's
3 : Things and so does this one and they're both
2 : oh
1 : it's, it's not likely to be these three. Um I know there's doubles in here but
3 : Uh huh
2 : I got an idea, how about you come over to him
2 : and you take that card, I'll meet up with you and then two actions, you can give me those two, and I can run to the Moon or I can give you my two.
2 : actually
2 : I could give any person
2 : yeah
2 : so I would say meet up with him
2 : I got an idea.
3 : Ok wait, d- I just, I just want to hear about it before I move anything.
2 : Ok
2 : You're gonna move two.
3 : Ok
2 : Well on his turn or
2 : Alright you know what
2 : move here
2 : and on his turn he'll shore these up, move here, he'll give you this
2 : and I'm allowed to give treasure to anyone anywhere for
2 : per action, so you're goal is to start moving
2 : towards either of the earth treasures
2 : cause you're actually gonna be getting it
3 : instead of you, instead of me giving it to you
2 : right great
1 : yes
1 : C-can you transfer as many cards as you want?
2 : Ah one per action but yes anywhere. So that'll be two actions, so she could have all four of it.
1 : Ok
2 : Next turn so
1 : Ok
2 : Um so right now
1 : And we're-
2 : Ah one, two would be my suggestion. He'll give you his card on the next turn
1 : Ah, although
2 : And then he'll shore those up.
1 : um one
1 : well I
1 : I have one move
1 : and then that's three
2 : oh right, right
1 : So do we want to save that or do we want to make
1 : make that transfer?
2 : Well none of them are treasure ones so
3 : Except for that one.
2 : I would do one transfer
2 : and shore these up
2 : right
2 : if we lose that
3 : Cause we have two of them with the emblem that are both
2 : Right but we only need three.
1 : W-w-we, we can also wait for the transfer for the next one cause we're both close enough.
3 : true
2 : Correct
1 : I-I would say
1 : Um
1 : Prioritize the
1 : saving
2 : Ok then let's uh shore that up
1 : Yeah so
3 : Yeah that's what I'm thinking ok.
2 : Yeah
2 : So that's one action
3 : Ok
1 : yeah
3 : Oop sorry that's upside down.
1 : No that's good.
2 : Not a problem.
3 : Ok
3 : Then you want me to just get closer?
2 : Um, you might as well shore that up, that'll save you an action but ah yeah shore that up, that'll be two, move down here. He could move over, shore both these up, and transfer all in one move.
1 : Um
1 : (Inception)
2 : So I'd say shore that up.
1 : Does that work?
3 : Yeah that's fine with me.
1 : Ok
2 : Good job Pilot
1 : Alright and that's three.
2 : Yes, so here are your two action cards.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : or treasure sorry.
3 : Oo yay! Got another Helicopter Lift got another one of
1 : Yup
1 : Ok
2 : And here are your two, three, three flood cards
3 : those guys
3 : Three, three now, unfortunately.
1 : Ah
2 : Howling Garden
3 : Ok Temple of the Moon
3 : Howling Garden
2 : Temple of the Moon. That's gone
1 : ok and put the Howling Garden card in there.
2 : Mmhmm
2 : and Lost Lagoon
3 : Yeah
2 : That's gone
1 : I don't see
1 : Ok
3 : Which that doesn't really matter.
1 : And that was ok.
2 : But
2 : This needs to be discarded totally and this gets put back there.
3 : Right yeah I know.
1 : Yeah
3 : See that's why I said we need to save one of them
2 : Engineer's
1 : Good call, good call.
1 : Ok
1 : um
1 : Well yeah that, that wasn't worth it at all. So or-or like- yeah, so we're good. um
2 : Yeah
2 : So your turn Engineer
1 : Alright so I should
1 : Ah move then shore up and then we can do a transfer.
2 : It's a worthless card though, I just realized there's nothing to it.
1 : Well um except for moving.
2 : Ah
2 : Ok
1 : So mi-
1 : yeah
1 : um so I gonna m-
1 : move and then shore it up.
2 : Shore up and transfer perfect.
1 : That's two
1 : And then
1 : Um
3 : Is there a reason sorry, to interrupt,
3 : that
3 : you want me to do these purple ones, versus me give it to you?
2 : Yes because I could transfer to anyone. I don't have to be on the same square.
3 : Oh ok
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Um the other thing is is your
3 : Cool.
2 : S-so you're gonna start running there.
1 : Why don't we
1 : I-I think we should get the lion first cause I can transfer this one now you can send that one to her and that's
3 : Yeah
1 : That's one away
2 : Ok
3 : That makes sense
2 : Let's do it.
1 : Ok so I
3 : Ok
1 : I'll send this to you and that's my third action
3 : Thank you
2 : That's your third move, here's your treasures
1 : Ok
1 : Alright, that, that was convenient I suppose um
1 : And let's hope we
1 : actually I think we're ok
2 : Crimson Forest
1 : Yeah Crimson Forest
1 : Ah Copper Gate
2 : and Cave of Embers
1 : yeah
2 : Copper Gate
1 : It's here
2 : It's right there
2 : (--) only have five cards in your hand, right?
2 : These are special right? They don't count
1 : Oh oh you have six, um so why don't you
3 : Oh
1 : drop
1 : do
1 : do we want to
1 : S-so, that that should have happened on your last turn so I think we're ok we didn't break anything else.
3 : Ok
1 : Um which one do you want to drop?
1 : Uh ah I mean obviously we should save the Lions.
2 : Right
3 : Right
1 : Do you want to save the purple things?
2 : I would get rid of the Helicopter, it doesn't seem like we're using it a lot, yeah.
3 : Yeah cause I have two of them.
1 : Ok so get rid of one lift.
1 : And that'll be, ok. so that was going back a turn
3 : Ok
2 : Sorry about that
3 : Ah huh
1 : Now we up ahead?
2 : Oh right these count ok um.
1 : Oh so you also
2 : Right
2 : That's why she's pointing at that
1 : Ah so get rid of Fire cause we already have Fire.
2 : Oh
3 : Yeah that's a worthless card
2 : yeah
2 : Ok perfect
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Alright so we'll keep an eye on that in the future
2 : It says it doesn't count as an act- oh
1 : These
1 : Yeah ok
2 : not an action it's a card still
1 : Ok so these are done we've flooded those
1 : and now it's your turn
2 : it's my turn and everybody's at five
1 : Yup
3 : Yup
2 : Ok
2 : So I have three actions
1 : So
1 : I think
2 : So first thing is
1 : I, I would
2 : well that's going to knock another card out of her hand
1 : I, I would do
1 : Ah save one and two. Cause this has a card and this is central to moving.
2 : Right
1 : And then send one
1 : to
2 : But that'll knock one of her cards out cause she can only have five
1 : True
1 : Um
1 : Either way she has to get a lion
2 : Right
2 : So it's probably beneficial to knock that card out, give her the lion
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So I will save
2 : these, these two cards
1 : or these two? Ok
2 : Not the one I'm on.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : You can swim
2 : And
2 : Yeah
3 : Thank you
1 : Alright
1 : So knock out the purple
2 : And that goes to you
3 : Ok
1 : I suppose yeah
3 : Do we know how many of these purple cards are in total?
2 : Yes there is eight
2 : They showed in the
3 : Ok good
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok so discard other
2 : So
2 : That's discarded
1 : Ok
3 : whoo hoo
1 : And
2 : And actually to get down to five cause you can use it any time, you can also just use the action.
3 : Right
2 : So next time, so I'm at, I'll be at six now
1 : Ok
2 : So Sandbag, let's just save the Ember cave rather than just
2 : just
2 : getting rid of it
1 : sure
2 : Might as well use it
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And three floods
2 : I got the ah Coral Palace, the
1 : Ok we'll help you out
2 : Dunes, Coral Palace
1 : Yup
2 : Looks like
2 : And Silver Gate
3 : Here you go
2 : Right here
1 : Ok
3 : Silver Gate
2 : Alrighty gang
3 : Ok
1 : Very good
2 : Pilot
3 : Ok
3 : So
3 : I can
2 : So you're gonna wanna
3 : go wherever
3 : So I wanna just g-
2 : get to Whispering Winds and take the treasure
1 : Actually
1 : Ok
3 : Or should I just use those one of my moves and like fly somewhere after?
1 : Um
1 : I I'm wondering if you might not want to save one
2 : Oh yeah
1 : then move and then do that. This one's probably useless.
2 : Good idea
3 : Yeah
2 : So shore this one up
3 : Cause that actually has a symbol on it plus that's on the outskirts, it doesn't matter
1 : Yeah
2 : yeah
2 : Shore that up
1 : So so here's one
2 : move that
3 : Ok
1 : Two
1 : And then take the Lion
2 : And take your Lion
3 : Whoo hoo! And then I discard these?
1 : And those cards go in there.
2 : Yep
3 : Yeah
2 : And here's your Treasure
3 : Which helps empty out my
2 : Right
1 : Ok
2 : Here's your two actions.
3 : thanks
3 : Ok
2 : And no matter what you do it's three floods
3 : Ok let's see we'll
2 : So remember the worthless actions also.
3 : Yeah I'm just gonna sort of separate that and knowing that that's already taken so it doesn't quite matter.
1 : Yeah
1 : Mmhm.
2 : Mmhm.
2 : So the Lion is worthless also, we still have these two (card)
1 : Ok
3 : Ok so we have the Temple of the Sun
1 : (Here) can you put them down? Ok.
2 : Ah Temple of the Sun got.
1 : Um
3 : Tidal Palace, got it.
1 : And the Bronze Gate, ok.
2 : Yeah we're good. We got all of them.
3 : Ok
2 : Engineer.
1 : And those go over here.
3 : Ok one more to get.
1 : Alright my turn?
1 : Ok
1 : Um
2 : Don't worry about these, these are worthless.
1 : Yeah
2 : And even though if we lose that I'm sitting right next to the Temple of the Moon.
1 : Ok so
2 : S-
1 : Um
2 : So don't think shoring up's important.
1 : My priority
1 : Actually, alright, where, where's the nearest cup.
3 : There's one here.
1 : Ok so if, if I go, if I go
2 : If you hop over there
1 : Here
2 : I can get it to you next turn right?
1 : Right
1 : Um
1 : So
1 : But, but then I want to be in, end up the over there. Um, should I try and
1 : save these maybe if I move over, save and then move back one?
2 : One
1 : And then I'm with in a turn
2 : But they don't affect movement, they're not treasure cards.
3 : But is there a reason they don't affect anything?
1 : Oh that's true. That's true.
2 : So
2 : I wouldn't, I wouldn't use that.
2 : Uh
1 : Ok so leave those um so if anything I should just move.
1 : Unless
1 : Somebody wants
2 : B-
1 : Um
1 : purple
1 : But I
2 : I guess I'm now the collector of purple now
1 : But I think we're ok
3 : Yeah if you have enough turns I would give him the purple but if not I wouldn't
3 : prioritize that
1 : Ok so
1 : it, it
2 : ah suggestion
1 : Actually
1 : we only need
2 : one, two. Sh might as well shore these two up cause you're still only one away. You'll have the fourth cup.
1 : Yeah
2 : because I'll be giving that to you.
1 : Ok I think that one's good. It's just blue.
1 : Um but
1 : Oh oh right.
2 : Ooo r- one, two. The two adjacents. Yeah.
1 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : The other thing is we only need three, we don't need four.
2 : Right
3 : Right we don't need all, so
1 : So i-if we're going for the cups, m-might as well move.
3 : Just get
2 : Don't even care about that and everyone start moving towards Fool's Landing.
1 : Just m-, just move and you can send it to me and we'll move towards Fool's
2 : Perfect.
3 : Ok
2 : And we got the game.
1 : Alright.
1 : Um, and what the heck, I'll save this.
1 : Um so that's my turn.
1 : And now I draw two of those.
1 : and
2 : The flood
1 : Yup, Water Rises.
2 : Still have three.
1 : Yup
1 : And then
2 : This gets shuffled, puts on top.
2 : And both of you have cards that could win the game for us if we all get to Fool's Landing with the third one.
1 : Cool
2 : Good game
1 : Um can we ask for a time check?
3 : Mmhmm
3 : It's right there.
2 : It's right there. Twelve minutes.
1 : Oh wow ok we're good. Um so that goes over there.
2 : Yeah
3 : We have plenty of time
2 : Alright
2 : And here
1 : And I still only have five. So we're good.
2 : And
2 : Right.
3 : Yup
2 : So flood
1 : Oh

1 : Three floods now
2 : and
2 : we'll help you find them.

2 : Cave of Embers
3 : There you go, got it.
1 : Ah cor- Copper Gate.
2 : Copper Gate.
1 : And Temple of the Sun.
2 : Temple of the Sun fell off.
2 : That's the Moon yeah.
1 : Oh sorry. Temple of the Moon ok close enough, yeah.
2 : Uh the sun one
1 : Alright.
1 : Here I'll... go like that.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Alrighty, my turn.
1 : Is to send me one of those.
2 : Alright here you go and of course get rid of, perfect.
3 : Uh huh
1 : Give her a purple.
2 : Purple, that's my special move, that's one action for me.
1 : and then you should move
2 : I'm just gonna start running towards it.
1 : I
1 : Yeah ok that's it.
2 : Cause we only need three treasures and you're sitting on it.
3 : Ok
2 : And we all need to get there.
1 : Yup
2 : Ah take my two treasures.
2 : And it doesn't really matter.
1 : Ok
2 : Can I discard more than one or no?
1 : so
2 : That doesn't matter at this point, ok.
3 : It doesn't matter.
1 : Yeah
2 : So throw that out uh my three flood cards.
3 : Yes
2 : Are Breaker's Bridge, uh Cliffs of Abandon
2 : And the Dunes.
1 : Cliffs of Abandon is here.
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Ok
2 : Perfect.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Pilot
1 : Ok
3 : So you're already sitting on what you want, so we don't need to worry about that.
2 : Right so you just go to Fool's
1 : Yes
1 : Um
3 : so
1 : a-and
3 : just try and get as close
1 : Y-you're isolated
1 : y-
1 : Um
1 : So if these were to go out
1 : but
2 : But she could fly anywhere is her special move, right.
1 : You you can still move, you can still fly so we're ok.
3 : So these don't matter at all so I should just go here.
2 : No actually just use your special move and fly here
2 : and wait for the end of the game, he's gonna take the third treasure. I'm gonna move there. We're off the island.
3 : But I can use this at
3 : one per turn. So, I can save this just
1 : M-might as well save it. Sure go for it.
2 : Yeah save this, save this, then fly. Sure, you can save
3 : It's right there just in case anyone wants to go that pattern.
3 : Yeah but these don't matter cause there's nothing on them, so I would just say
2 : Ok
1 : Alright your call.
2 : You could do adjacent right. There's one.
3 : Well I don't even need to do it. I could just save it and then fly here.
1 : yeah
2 : Right
1 : That, that's two, done.
3 : And then there's nothing else that needs to be done. Correct?
2 : Treasure.
1 : Uh and we have Sandbag's now. Cool.
2 : (--)
3 : And Sandbags.
1 : And you ah only have five cards so we're good.
2 : No
3 : Ok.
1 : And what are we flipping?
2 : Crimson Forest.
2 : Crimson Forest is gone.
3 : Which doesn't matter.
1 : ok
2 : Temple of the Moon's flipped
1 : ok, also doesn't matter
2 : And Whispering Gardens
2 : what you were standing on
1 : also doesn't matter
3 : yeah
2 : doesn't matter
1 : because we already have that
2 : but
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : cool
2 : That
2 : gets put there
1 : Alright, my first turn, is to take the treasure.
2 : yeah
2 : take your treasure
1 : And those go over there.
3 : Whoo hoo!
2 : Excellent
2 : You move one.
1 : So
1 : Yup
2 : That's your sec- or
1 : And that's it, ok.
2 : Doesn't matter if you
2 : shore up.
2 : Here's your two
2 : treasures.
1 : Ok
1 : Irrelevant
2 : Here's your three floods
1 : Three ok, Bronze Gate
2 : Bronze Gate's gone.
1 : Silver Gate, that's also gone
2 : S-
1 : And ah Coral Palace
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Coral Palace. Right here, flipped.
1 : Flipped, ok
3 : cool
1 : And we're ok there
1 : Um so that goes here.
2 : Alrighty
3 : ok
2 : And I'm gray?
3 : S- join us!
2 : Here we go. And I'll get down to five, but if I happen to pull a lift, I could raise the water.
1 : Sure
1 : Ok
2 : Uh could you shuffle those?
1 : sure, yep, will do
2 : I got to discard an action and it doesn't matter, but
2 : just in the sense of gaming
3 : (well)
2 : I like to discard that one and we're at four now.
2 : But it doesn't matter cause we're leaving
3 : Yeah
2 : Uh Temple of the Moon is gone
3 : Ok
1 : Ok, here.
2 : Uh
2 : Uh Cliffs of Abandon
2 : is
1 : Um got it
2 : got it. uh Dunes is gone
1 : Cause that goes there, or here.
3 : Back there
2 : And, sorry. And Breaker's Bridge is gone.
3 : Ok, and we survived! With this
2 : And you use that and we've won.
3 : Ok
2 : We're off
3 : We're off
2 : good job everybody!
3 : nice
1 : whoo!
2 : I thought it was going to be like a triangle high five, but alright it works
1 : Uh oh
1 : There we go.

1 : Ok
1 : So I'm gonna start with shoring up those two, sound good?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Ok that's one action.
2 : Yup
1 : So I have two more.
1 : Um I could move here and shore those up. Right?
3 : Right.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And that would be three.
1 : And then I have to get two treasure cards.
1 : 
1 : Oh so Water Rise.
1 : Ok let's see move one tick mark.
1 : Shuffle the
1 : discard pile. Oh I guess we have one.
1 : Place on top.
3 : And then the Water Rise card comes over here.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Ok cool.
1 : Now it's your turn right?
2 : And then do you have to draw flood cards at the end?
1 : Oh right
1 : So now I draw two.
3 : Yep
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And I have Gold Gate and Phantom Rock.
3 : phantom Rock, that's sunk now.
1 : Ok so then take the flood card.
2 : Oh
2 : Oh shoot
2 : Sorry and then this goes as well
1 : That sunk too?
3 : Alright
1 : Ok so did that eliminate anything for us?
1 : Or we still have options
3 : Ah
1 : Or I guess less for
1 : Did any of those have the icons? ok.
3 : We still have options.
2 : Ok my turn
1 : Your turn.
2 : Ok so I
2 : I think I'll move this way
1 : Ok
2 : Since that's farther away from the edge and then.
2 : Oh
2 : I don't know if I really need to move much further. I guess I can move to a spot where
2 : one of these guys
2 : is (--)?
3 : Hmm
1 : Yeah
2 : So this might make more sense.
2 : Since this Lion's here and I have
2 : The Lion
1 : Ok.
3 : Yeah we'll have to wait till we get more of our treasure cards to see which one's like the be- easiet one to get right away.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : And then
1 : You get two treasure cards now right?
2 : Yeah I'll just
1 : If you're done your actions.
2 : I think that makes the most sense, yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Um Sandbags that's useful, and another one of these guys.
2 : And then I have to draw two flood cards.
1 : Two flood cards.
2 : So
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Temple of the Moon
1 : Ok.
1 : I'll flip this, and where's the- what's the other one?
2 : Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Oh right here.
2 : Ok
3 : Alright my turn?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ok um where do you guys think I should fly?
1 : Oh right cause you can fly. Well let's see you have two of these.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Do you?
1 : I have two of these, we have two of these so
3 : Yeah really t-
1 : Anything but
1 : purple.
1 : That's or we have those equal
1 : amount
3 : Alright
3 : I'll, I'll just move right here.
3 : We'll s ee how that goes.
1 : And
2 : Ok
1 : Ok.
3 : So now I have two more actions right?
1 : Yeah.
1 : Should you?
1 : And y-
2 : Can you?
2 : Shore up diagonally? I don't think you can. It would just be moving diagonally.
1 : No
1 : No that
3 : Could I
3 : Maybe if I fly there and then shore that one up?
1 : Yeah.
2 : That's an option.
1 : Or do you want to wait, do you want to
3 : Alright I'll fly it.
1 : Well that one
1 : doesn't have- should we shore up this instead?
2 : Have
3 : Yeah
1 : Can you fly there cause that has an icon on it.
3 : Yeah can I fly right on it and shore it up? Is that a thing?
1 : Um
2 : I think
2 : so?
1 : You're, you're Pilot
3 : I mean it doesn't really matter where I move cause I'm the Pilot so I'll just
1 : Once per turn for action. Yeah cause you can shore up what you're on can't you?
3 : Yeah, I'm just gonna go for it.
2 : I'm pretty sure you can.
1 : Ok, yeah.
1 : Only once per turn
1 : for one action. Oh no you can't cause you already flew.
3 : Gotcha.
1 : Oh wait.
1 : We misread that, ok so don't do that.
3 : Alright, I'll just draw two cards.
1 : Ok
3 : Got another one of these and Helicopter.
1 : Ok then you need
1 : two flood cards.
1 : Here you go, what'd it say?
3 : Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
1 : I'll put them in discard pile for you.
1 : Alright
2 : Ok I think it's your turn
1 : Ok now it's my turn. Ok.
1 : Well, should I shore stuff up?
2 : You're the
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Let's see well. I can do
1 : This can be a turn I guess and then this is my second or my second action right? Cause I can do two for one
3 : Mhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : And then
1 : Um
1 : Should I
1 : I- treasure- giving treasure cards is an action right?
3 : Yeah but you have to be on the same tile I believe
1 : To give them?
3 : Yeah unless you're the Messenger.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Oh.
1 : Ok so I can't. Ok so then is there anything else I should do?
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
1 : Or should I move here and shore this up right? Or no that would be two more actions.
2 : That would be two separate actions yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : So
1 : Anything else?
3 : I think, I think we're fine right now.
1 : Ok so now I need
1 : two treasure cards right?
3 : Yeah
1 : Is it it's always two right?
2 : Mmhmm.
2 : Yeah.
1 : But then when I have more then five, I have to discard, but now I'm at five.
3 : Alright and we have four of these guys.
1 : Yeah.
3 : So we'll work on transferring cards.
1 : And that
1 : Ok and now I need two floods, right?
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And we have Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.
1 : Whispering Garden
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : So it's my turn I'm gonna move away from the flooded
1 : So that's one.
2 : thing
2 : Um
3 : I think you should shore that up too because it's got the, the wind on it.
2 : I think that mi- yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 : Yeah
1 : So that's two, now you have one more.
2 : And I can only shore up ones that are adjacent to me so there aren't any other ones that are flooded
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah so you could either move or you could just end your turn or
1 : Or you could give a single card per action.
2 : Oh that's true.
1 : Would that be helpful? But then I have to get rid of something if you give it to me and if you
1 : can you- you can't really give him anything.
3 : Yeah I don't really have use for anything
1 : Ok
3 : You could use the Sandbags on
3 : One of the tiles but
3 : Neither of them have a treasure associated with them.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : That doesn't seem like a
1 : Ok
3 : So you're just gonna end it?
2 : Yeah I think so. Oh great.
1 : Ok
2 : Um so I got one of these guys and then
2 : Water's Rise so this goes up. Shuffle the card- flood dis- pile
1 : Cool
1 : And then you pick
1 : three now right?
1 : As part of your turn. Put that away.
2 : And then pick three yeah.
1 : Yeah.
2 : So, Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Whispering Garden, Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Whispering Garden.
1 : Ok
3 : Alright I'm, I'm thinking that we needa
3 : somehow transfer these cards to one of us.
1 : Yeah.
3 : And use it on one of these. I'm assuming this one cause it's closer.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : But
3 : we're separated so I should probably- well you could, you could shore that up too also.
1 : Yeah.
1 : I could shore it up.
3 : um
1 : And then move or something.
1 : So what should you do?
3 : Or I can fly.
3 : I can, I can fly you here and then because we're on the same tile I can give you
1 : Oh yeah then.
1 : Yeah.
3 : this card and you discard one of those.
1 : Yeah that would be good cause then I can get the treasure on my turn which is next.
1 : Right?
3 : Ok yeah let's do that. So I'll fly you first. That doesn't count as a turn.
3 : To here.
1 : Ok
3 : Then I'll give you.
3 : This card and you-
1 : Yeah.
1 : So what should I get rid of? It doesn't
3 : Yeah we have one of each so either.
1 : You both have
1 : Oh but you have two purple so I'll get rid of this.
3 : Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : Ok
1 : So put that in the discard right?
3 : Yup.
1 : So that was one of your turn, or one action.
3 : Yeah
1 : So now you have two more if you want to do anything.
3 : So I still have two.
3 : So I could
1 : But you should stay here so I can or no now I have it, it doesn't matter.
3 : Yeah so I could fly somewhere and shore something up
3 : in my last two turns right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Did you already fly somewhere or did you stay in the same place? Ok you've flown to there ok.
1 : No he flew me.
3 : No I haven't moved yet.
1 : So you might as well fly somewhere.
1 : And shore something up on your last
1 : two right?
3 : Yeah I'm just trying to think where which one I should
3 : shore up.
3 : Probably that one I'm thinking
1 : Yeah, it's the most valuable.
3 : Alright.
3 : I'll fly here
1 : Ok so now you need two treasure.
1 : And then when you're ready three flood cards.
3 : Alright, Iron Gate.
3 : Lost Lagoon.
1 : I think Iron Gate's out now right?
2 : Iron Gate
3 : Yeah and Temple of the Moon.
1 : And Temple of the Moon. Ok those two are out.
2 : Iron Gate
1 : And then you got the oh yeah I got that one, or I got the Temple of the Moon. No tha- I already flipped it.
2 : Oh ok.
1 : Ok.
3 : Alright.
1 : So now
3 : This
1 : can go into the discard and now it's my turn right? So I want to, how do I buy or-
3 : Yeah it goes over there.
3 : Yup
2 : Mhm
1 : How do I get the?
3 : That just, just costs one action.
2 : I think you just put it in the
1 : Ok so that's one action so.
3 : To get
3 : to capture a treasure?
1 : Do I
1 : do anything with these cards or?
1 : Is that clear?
2 : You woud probably put 'em here.
3 : Ah probably put 'em here.
1 : Then I take this right?
1 : Let's see.
1 : Is that in there?
1 : Treasure deck.
1 : Four cards.
2 : If you discard four matching treasure cards to the discard- treasure discard pile while your pawn is on the-
1 : Ok
1 : Cool.
2 : It has to be on a corresponding tile.
1 : Yeah it's on it so I'll take this
2 : Ok cool.
1 : Put those- so that's one of my actions right?
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Yeah
1 : So now
1 : I can move well, I might as well
1 : move up here and shore these so for my last part of my turn right?
3 : Sure.
2 : Mhmm
1 : Cause I can do two.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
1 : And now my turn is over. I need two treasure cards right?
3 : Yup.
1 : And then three flood cards.
1 : Ok Crimson Forest, Copper Gate and
2 : Crimson Forest
1 : Temple of the Sun.
3 : Alright
1 : Where's Temple of the Sun? Ok.
3 : Down here.
2 : Down here
1 : And now I put these here.
1 : You're turn.
2 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : Let's see
3 : So we have four of these.
2 : Yeah
3 : So we should probably work on that next.
2 : Right. Um
1 : And you're close to one of them.
1 : So
1 : It has to be your turn to give your card to someone right?
1 : To give treasure cards. Yeah.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Yeah yeah yeah they cost one action.
1 : Yeah ok.
1 : So can you give more than one treasure card?
1 : Or is it just one card per
1 : What does that say?
2 : Um it says I can give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action
1 : Ok so
3 : Yeah it says give one or more.
2 : So theoretically I could give more than one card.
1 : That's
1 : Yeah so maybe you could give
2 : Um
2 : Who else would be close to? I guess it would be
1 : Well he, he can fly anywhere right? And he's going
3 : Yeah.
2 : That's true.
3 : Yeah and I'm right there anyways.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Ok so I'll, my one action will be giving those to you.
1 : Ok
2 : And my second action.
1 : Do you want to shore something up?
2 : We'll shore up this guy.
3 : We also have Sandbags too because both of these
1 : Oh yeah we need to do something with that. So maybe that should be your third one.
2 : Oh that's very true.
3 : Yeah we can't risk losing those. And I have Sandbags too.
3 : Oh and this doesn't count as an action.
2 : Oh
2 : Oh yeah and this doesn't either so.
1 : Oh right. Uh maybe you should do this one cause it's closer first.
2 : Yeah so I'll
2 : shore up this guy
1 : Put that away
2 : That doesn't count as anything
3 : Do you still have two or one?
1 : Ok so you still have
2 : I had one more.
1 : One more.
3 : Ok
1 : Is there anything else you want to do?
2 : Um
2 : I don't know if there's anything that really makes much more sense to do.
3 : Yeah I think we're alright right now
1 : Ok
1 : So now two treasure.
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : Alright one of these guys and then.
1 : You may only have five cards in your hand.
1 : You have six.
3 : Oh I have six. Ok I'll discard.
1 : When did you get that.
3 : Just this turn.
1 : Oh just this time, ok.
2 : Oh
1 : so
3 : I'm gonna discard
1 : it hasn't started.
3 : Sandbags because I think we'll be alright right now. We don't have a lot of flood and we need this at the end anyways.
1 : Ok, ok.
2 : mm.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok so
1 : You got a Water's Rise, ok.
2 : Yep so I did this already yet alright thank you.
1 : Here I'll push it up for you. Oh you already did?
1 : Or not it's getting (--)
2 : I don't think so.
2 : Then shuffle these guys again
1 : Ok so
1 : Put it on top.
2 : Mmhmm. And then I need to draw three.
1 : Three. Yeah see
1 : You can work together to
2 : Temple of the Sun, Temple of the Moon.
1 : Make it move faster.
3 : Temple of the Sun's gone.
2 : And Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Ok.
2 : This guy
2 : So which one's gone? Temple? Ok
3 : Temple of the Sun.
1 : So we really need to protect this or we're out.
2 : Yeah.
1 : Ok so
3 : Yeah.
1 : now it's your turn?
1 : Pilot
3 : Yeah I'm just
3 : worried about this one like if
3 : I don't
1 : well can you fly there and just shore it up?
3 : Yeah but then
3 : Oh yeah I guess I could I'm trying to think ah maybe I'll move here shore it up and then you can shore your- that one up and move here transfer the
1 : Yeah.
3 : the cards and then I'll fly there when- once it's my turn around again?
1 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah that would work.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ok so here's one of my actions.
3 : This is two.
3 : Um
3 : and
3 : I think
3 : is there anything else that needs to be done right now?
1 : I don't think so. What do you think?
2 : I can't think of anything
1 : Ok so
1 : My turn so I'll sh-
2 : Well did you have a
3 : Oh I gotta
1 : Oh wait yeah you gotta get that treasure.
3 : pull my two cards. And I gotta discard some.
1 : Get rid of one.
1 : Or two.
3 : Yeah I have a lot of cards so I'll just discard one of these right away cause I already have one.
3 : And I guess
3 : just discard one of these.
1 : I guess.
1 : And then three flood cards.
3 : Copper Gate.
3 : Crimson Forest.
3 : So Crimson Forest is gone and Whispering Garden.
1 : Whispering Garden. I just saw that.
1 : Oh right up here.
1 : Ok.
2 : Alright so we need that guy.
1 : So now it's my turn.
1 : Well I should probably shore this up, I'm guessing.
1 : And then.
1 : What else can I do?
3 : Um y- move there.
1 : Oh I can move here.
2 : And give.
1 : And then I can give you.
2 : The Lion.
3 : Yeah and then that's all three of your turns.
1 : This and that's that all three of them that I need. Ok.
3 : And I got to discard another card right?
1 : So just get rid of the purple.
1 : I would
3 : This one?
1 : Cause you need the Helicopter. No I would get rid of that.
2 : We need a Helicopter Lift to get off yeah.
3 : Oh purple.
1 : And then so give me two treasure cards.
3 : Oh cool (--)
1 : Ok so we're pretty set on that and then I need three of these.
1 : Ok Silver Gate.
1 : Cliff something, Cliffs of Abandon and Tidal Palace.
1 : Anything out or no we're good.
3 : No we already got this one anyways, so it doesn't even matter if that sinks.
1 : Ok.
1 : Oh true. Ok so we don't (--) saving that. So that's the end of my turn. Now it's yours.
2 : Cool
2 : Ok.
2 : Um
1 : Um oh you probably definitely want to shore that up.
3 : Shore that up.
2 : Yeah.
1 : So that's one.
2 : And then I can
2 : I guess it doesn't matter if it's either of those
1 : Well it would probably be good cause we're both
1 : well it doesn't matter now cause sh- does it matter? well cause we
2 : Oh
1 : can still be on it after it sinks, we can just move off of it
3 : Mhmm
1 : so it doesn't really matter.
2 : Yeah
2 : So should I move
2 : over
2 : well, doesn't matter.
1 : Maybe you sh-
1 : should you start?
1 : Should you start moving there so
3 : Try to
3 : So you can turn it in?
1 : Or
1 : Or should you
1 : yeah I don't know.
3 : Maybe I would just shore up to keep mobility because these are all sort of like
1 : Yeah true.
3 : Around the same area.
3 : So you've only done one.
2 : So shore up
2 : this guy?
3 : Yeah I would
2 : And that would be my second move.
1 : Cause you didn't move right? So you could
1 : Or did you move?
2 : Yeah I
2 : shoring up was one of my actions and then two.
1 : So one two and then maybe
2 : Can I just move here? And then I would be closer to this if we
2 : Well actually it makes more sense for you to be closer.
1 : Or should you shore up this- or should you shore up this one too cause it's in the center?
3 : Yeah as long as we're all together I can just fly there.
3 : Yeah might as well.
1 : And we can't move diagonally so that would be kind of difficult.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
1 : So that's your turn, so two treasure.
2 : Ok
3 : And three flood cards?
1 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah, ok so then
1 : and you's
1 : have five so you're good.
2 : five and then three.
1 : three
2 : Dunes of Deception, Cave of Shadows, Bronze Gate.
1 : Bronze Gate, where's Cave of Shadows?
3 : Right here.
2 : Was this already flipped? Ok
1 : Oh
1 : No I just flipped it.
1 : So we're
1 : all good.
2 : Ok
3 : Ah my turn? Alright so I'll
1 : Yeah so you should
1 : You can fly right and then just trade?
3 : Yeah
3 : So fly here.
3 : That's one action. Turning them in is another action.
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : And they go here right?
1 : Yeah and then you get that piece.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : And I have one more action.
3 : Um
1 : So should you maybe just move off of that cause it doesn't really matter any more?
3 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah I can
1 : Just to get mobility.
3 : Just move back.
1 : So now you need two treasure.
1 : And I'll hand you these three.
3 : And we got four of the embers already so we got
3 : Cave of Embers, is now sunk.
1 : Ok
3 : Howling Garden and Misty Marsh.
1 : Misty Marsh. Ok.
1 : And now it's my turn right? We just put these in discard?
2 : Mhmm
1 : Ok so I'm here
3 : Yeah
1 : We do still need, we need one of these so I might as well shore this up.
3 : One of those yeah.
2 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah.
2 : And then I realized I can give you this on my next turn.
1 : And so that's one
1 : That's one turn. Ok, or
1 : well no, no, I should just move here and give it to you.
1 : Right?
1 : To finish off my turn?
3 : Give what to her?
1 : If I'm, I could give her these cards and she would have all
2 : I don't know if you can give me more than one card though. Can you?
1 : Yeah can I give you thr-, we can give multiple cards right? Didn't you say that?
3 : yeah.
3 : yeah if you're on the same tile.
1 : Yeah so that was my one turn.
2 : Oh.
1 : Should I move
2 : But I can't have more than five.
1 : But then you just discard.
2 : I guess that's
1 : Right can't she?
1 : dis
1 : If I give her more she can't hold them so she has to discard some right? Cause didn't I give
1 : Didn't we give
3 : Yeah the second you get them you just have to discard others.
1 : You just have to get rid of other ones.
2 : Ok.
1 : Because then if we do that, then you could just go to that one if it doesn't sink.
1 : or this one, right?
2 : Yeah.
3 : How many turns have you used? Just one?
1 : I've just used one.
1 : So I can move here, give her the cards.
2 : But I can't
1 : And then
2 : My
2 : my pawn isn't on a space where I can redeem it.
1 : But then on your turn, couldn't you move here and then redeem it?
2 : But I think I would have to immediately
3 : It would take her two turns.
2 : Discard the cards that you give me.
1 : No you could discard other ones couldn't you? If I say I gave you
3 : Those three then you could discard that, that, and that.
1 : If I give you these three you could get rid of these three.
2 : I can, ok.
1 : Then on your next turn
1 : you could go down to here and get that and then we'd almost win right?
2 : Ok
2 : I think so cause we would
1 : Is that correct? ok so
3 : Yeah just
2 : Cause we just have to
2 : Get three of these guys and then get to the landing.
1 : and then get back to here and you already have that card.
3 : It'll just take you two turns to move down there right? Two actions?
2 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah and then the third to redeem.
2 : Yeah.
1 : So I move here next for my second action.
3 : Sure.
1 : So now I'm with her.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : And I can give you these as my final one.
1 : And then you get rid of three.
2 : Yeah it's a single card.
1 : Give a single card but didn't it say cards on here?
2 : A Messenger can give more than
1 : or no
1 : Oh I can't cause I'm not a Messenger.
2 : Yeah
1 : A Messenger
3 : Well it just says here you may give one or more of your treasure cards to another player if you're on the same island tile.
1 : So isn't this contradicatory then to that?
3 : Well just follow that one?
3 : Oh you can't do
3 : all four
1 : But doesn't wait where did you say it says give more than card?
3 : Choose three actions of the four action types.
1 : Where does it say cards plural on here though isn't that different?
1 : Give a card. It says you give or one more treasure cards to another player if both pawns are on the same, so that doesn't
3 : It said one or more.
1 : make sense.
3 : alright well
2 : It cost one action for each card to give away, so that's why.
1 : Oh, oh ok. That's the part we were missing.
3 : Oh, gotcha, gotcha ok.
1 : Ok so I can't
1 : do that, so I can well I already moved there so that was my action so I don't think I can take it back.
2 : How many, did you only move one?
1 : But then I shored that, so I have one action left, so.
2 : Oh ok.
1 : I guess I could.
3 : You could
1 : what should I do?
3 : Just to use an action
1 : Might as well give her something right? Should I give her a purple?
2 : Like one card?
2 : Yeah
1 : Should I give her a purple one?
3 : Ah
1 : Cause then she'll have three?
2 : Well I'm closer to
2 : Either the I guess the red one.
1 : Cause this one's close too.
2 : Oh that's true.
3 : Oh yeah.
1 : Should I just give that to her then cause we didn't realize that?
3 : Yeah we just gotta hope that yeah
1 : Ok and then you'll just have to get rid of one.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Ok
3 : Just the Lion probably.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Cause we already
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so now oh I need two treasure and then
1 : Three flood, sorry I misunderstood that I guess. Ok Water Rise and Helicopter Lift.
3 : Yeah I just didn't read the next sentence.
1 : Ok so gotta do this immediately.
1 : Rise
3 : and we have
3 : More Helicopter Lifts now so we can fly multiple people whenever we get enough cards
1 : Oh cool so that goes in the discard. We shuffle that.
2 : Mhmm
1 : And then put them on top and now it's still three though.
3 : And we still have just about fourteen minutes.
1 : Oh I didn't know there was, I was wondering how much I was like how do we not know how much time we have.
2 : I was wondering where the timer was.
1 : Ok three, so we have.
1 : Temple
1 : Breaker's Bridge and Bronze Gate.
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Temple of the Moon, Breaker's Bridge and then Bronze Gate. Where's that one?
2 : This one so what?
1 : Yeah so that one's out ok.
1 : So Bronze Gate, take that.
1 : Discard.
2 : Ok.
1 : Now it's your turn.
2 : Alright so.
1 : When I- we can use these at any time right?
1 : Not- it doesn't count as an action. So I could fly her somewhere if she needed to or you could.
3 : yeah.
2 : Mmhmm. Yeah.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah we're all on the same tile so we could all fly anywhere.
1 : Yeah.
2 : So I
2 : should move one and then shore this guy and that'll be my second
1 : shore that up
1 : So that's two
3 : So that's two actions.
2 : And then
2 : Should I give you, I should give you this so that you have
1 : But you're not on the same space as me now.
2 : But I'm the Messenger so I can
3 : She's the Messenger though.
1 : Oh you're the Messenger so it doesn't matter where you do it.
2 : yeah
1 : Messenger (--) oh anywhere on his turn but need not be on the same tile, ok yeah.
1 : Cool.
1 : And now I still have five so I'm good.
2 : Mhmm
1 : And then two right? And then
3 : Yeah two treasure cards and three flood
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : I'm
1 : Here are your three cards.
2 : Did we already get rid of this thing?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yep
2 : So then I might as well get that.
1 : And this for you
2 : Um, Silver Gate
2 : Dunes of Deception which is now out and Copper Gate.
1 : And Silver Gate's out and then what's the last one?
2 : Um Copper Gate.
1 : Where's that oh, here we go.
1 : Ok
1 : So your turn?
1 : Um
3 : Yeah my turn
1 : So we still need, so we just need one more.
1 : And I can probably get this one on the next.
3 : I could, I could even use this
1 : turn or
3 : to
1 : or should you fly me there?
3 : fly you there?
3 : Cause we have two of them. We only need one to leave the game.
1 : yeah.
1 : So should you fly me here?
1 : Considering it's not sunk and that one could sink?
3 : That's what I'm thinking.
1 : As one turn. Oh wait, that doesn't even count, that doesn't even count as an action ok yeah.
3 : Yeah.
3 : Then no that doesn't count, so I might as well just do that now right?
1 : So fly me here yeah I'm red.
3 : You're red right?
3 : Ok
1 : Ok so that's the first thing. So now you have two more things.
3 : No that doesn't count it's still three.
1 : Oh right you still have three sorry.
1 : Um what do you want to do?
3 : Um
1 : Should you might as well
1 : Shore those up just in case?
1 : Or
1 : What else do you really need to do?
3 : Well just think, I'm trying to think ahead right now.
3 : Once your turn, once your turn comes around
1 : which is next
3 : yeah we turn that in, we have all three and we just need to get here.
1 : Yeah
3 : And then use your Helicopter Lift.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : Oh should you take steps to get closer?
3 : So
3 : I could just fly there.
1 : Oh right so should you do that for your turn?
3 : I'm thinking.
3 : Yeah I'm thinking we don't need to like shore up anything else right?
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah I don't think so cause even if this
1 : floods it's, I can still take it.
3 : Yeah so once I fly here
2 : Well
2 : Well don't we need to make sure that
2 : Oh wait no sorry this is here.
1 : Ok so
1 : Is your turn over?
1 : Now take your treasure cards? Right and then.
3 : Yeah I think I can
3 : Yep
1 : Your Flood cards.
1 : Here you go.
3 : I got Whispering Garden, Howling Garden and Cave of Embers.
1 : Cave of Embers oh Whispering Garden flips.
1 : So those two are out.
2 : Cave of-
1 : That one goes over here.
1 : Ok so now it's my turn.
2 : Mmhmm.
1 : I can
3 : Turn those in as an action.
1 : Turn those in take this guy.
1 : And then I- so that was one right?
1 : Now I can just move here right?
3 : Yeah.
3 : That's what I'm thinking.
1 : Ok
1 : And then I need two of these and then three
1 : Three of these guys
1 : So we have
1 : Cave of Shadows
1 : Tidal Palace
1 : And Cliffs of Abandon
1 : So nothing- did one
3 : Yeah Tidal Palace.
1 : sink? Which one?
1 : Here you go
1 : And now you should just take your turn getting there right?
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah so one, two and that's-
3 : Yeah
1 : One two and then I use the Helicopter to fly us out which doesn't matter.
2 : Do you have to use it on your turn, or can it use at any time? Ok?
1 : No cause it's a special card right?
1 : And then we're
3 : Yeah you can use that at any time.
1 : we're good?
1 : Right?
3 : I believe so.
1 : Yeah they're writing things down so.

2 : Ok
3 : I've played the desert one.
2 : Wait wait
3 : oh
2 : Ok
1 : Alright I start.
2 : Yeah.
1 : So my first action I'm going to
1 : move
1 : here and then I'm going to move here.
1 : That's two actions
2 : Ok
1 : then I'm gonna flip this
1 : and flip this. So can I have two treasure cards?
2 : Yes
2 : Here you go
1 : Thanks.
1 : Aw I got a Water's Rise card already.
2 : Cool
1 : Ok
1 : And
1 : Discard this for me.
2 : Uh oh
2 : I guess
1 : Thanks and then wait
2 : And then
1 : Shuffle these first, yeah.
2 : I get it
3 : So that was only
3 : Was that two actions?
1 : Yeah I still or no it was three. One, two and then
2 : Hmm
1 : Shore up.
3 : Oh, oh, oh
2 : Sh
1 : And I have to draw two of these so
1 : Lost Lagoon and Golden Gate sink
1 : Someone help me find them.
3 : Oh
1 : Oh no!
2 : Oh
3 : Crap. Mm
2 : Well at least it's not like uh one of these yeah.
1 : Good one yeah.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Now I my turn.
2 : Ok my turn.
2 : I will
3 : Oh the
3 : gate
1 : Oh
3 : the one that sunk.
2 : Oh
1 : Nice.
2 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : I'll give you the
1 : Thank you.
2 : That card? Ah
2 : And then I will
2 : Move down
2 : And
2 : Shore up?
1 : Do you want to do this one too cause you're adjacent?
2 : I think I can only do one though. Cause I'm not the Engineer.
1 : Oh that's right, yeah sorry that's my special power.
3 : Did you
3 : yeah
1 : Sorry about that.
2 : Ok and then I draw two of these.
2 : Um
2 : Ok I got
2 : Sandbag and one of these.
2 : Cool
3 : So if
1 : Treasure Card
1 : Or yeah treasure
3 : Flood
2 : Oh my God. ok
1 : Yeah
3 : I hope that nothing good sinks.
1 : Ok
2 : I got two.
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Whispering Garden.
2 : ok Breaker's Bridge.
1 : So that's
1 : Whispering Garden's right here
3 : Uh oh
2 : ok
2 : I'll use my Sandbag for this guys
3 : Uh
3 : I don't think you can use the Sandbag if you already drew the flood.
2 : Oh
3 : That's the
2 : Oh ok sorry
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok Breaker's Bridge
2 : is
3 : It's this one.
2 : Uh oh ok that one is gone.
1 : Oh no
1 : So am I
2 : Oh this one
1 : Swim
2 : And then flood that one.
1 : And then flip this one cause.
3 : Oh and that has a lion thingy on it.
2 : Yeah wait so when can I use this? Can shore up-
1 : Before you draw your flood
1 : cards
3 : so sooner rather than later because
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
3 : Once you draw the flood card it's like too late.
2 : Oh ok
2 : So there's no saving that whispering Garden.
1 : Maybe fingers crossed.
3 : Wait well s- you can use it now.
2 : Ok I can?
3 : After right, cause you can use it any time.
2 : Yeah ok
3 : Like you already flipped but then if you flip it back
1 : Ok
2 : Ok I will use it then.
1 : Ok
1 : Discard yeah
1 : There you go,ok.
2 : That is confusing ok.
1 : This is complicated.
2 : So I can't use it right after drawing the card but I can use it like
1 : Yeah
2 : Mm K
2 : Cool
3 : Generally
1 : I think
1 : Ok
1 : Pilot
1 : Your turn
3 : Oh was it?
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : Yes Pilot.
3 : Hello um ok.
3 : So where am I?
3 : I'm going to use my
2 : Do do you know what we should do?
1 : Hmm
2 : We should like
2 : Ok ne-
3 : Wait tell me
2 : Like whenever I get like
2 : Good cards, I should give them to you.
2 : Because then you could fly to whatever
1 : Yeah true.
2 : thing it is like even if it's not like close.
3 : Well I mean
2 : I mean if it like
3 : The thing is we can only have
2 : Oh yeah five
3 : five so
1 : Five
3 : F-
1 : I've got four right now.
3 : the
2 : ok
3 : Yeah the Engineer has like two different types of things going on so what it should be is like
2 : Ok
2 : Oh each person
3 : If you find one of these give it to me but if you find, you know, either of those
1 : either of these give them yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : Cool
3 : We'll start building up like who had four of what.
1 : Yeah
2 : I see
2 : Ok
3 : Um but I'm
3 : And then take a- ah
3 : can we tell from the back of the
3 : flooded card if it has one of these things?
2 : Yeah, yeah it has a little symbol so
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : It does? This one?
1 : Mmhmm, that one doesn't only only the ones with the circles.
2 : So we might as well yeah
3 : Ok so it doesn't matter if this one sinks basically
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok them I'm not
3 : gonna worry about it
3 : I guess
2 : That's the spirit
3 : Um ok
3 : but
3 : Are we penalized
3 : if
3 : the outer edges sink really?
2 : I don't think so
1 : No
1 : As long as we're on the
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Then I'm not that worried about it, so
2 : Ok
3 : Um what do I want to do?
3 : I guess
3 : Where am I? I could move
3 : I'll use my special power for an action.
2 : Ok
3 : I'll move here, just in case. Whatever.
2 : Cool
3 : And
3 : That's all the actions
2 : Wait
1 : You don't have to take all three so
3 : Yeah if
3 : if we're not trying to shore up
2 : Mhmm.
3 : Any other
3 : Is there any bene- if there's not beenfit to shoring up things that aren't shored up.
2 : Wait no you should
2 : like
2 : Ok never mind I'm I'm like
2 : Way over thinking this, ok.
3 : I'll just draw treasure and
2 : Ok
1 : Sounds good.
2 : Cool
3 : Get on with it.
3 : Ok I got these two
3 : And you'll have four so at some point I'm gonna be using one or giving on away.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : And um and now we do two of these.
2 : Ok
2 : Or wait oh, never mind.
3 : Should I?
2 : I was thinking if you had given, if you had flown to where I am
2 : If you fly your card to where I am
2 : You could give me your fire thing and then I could my fire thing
2 : to the Engineer so then she would have like
3 : Oooo
2 : Close you know?
3 : Oh that's good.
2 : Yeah
2 : But I don't know if you can do that since you already like drew the treasure cards and stuff, but
3 : Ok
3 : Um once per turn
1 : Yeah it's actions then treasure
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so I mean next turn you can- we can like figure it out.
1 : Yeah.
3 : Yeah ok, ok so
3 : But I could fly, use this and fly you to me
1 : Yeah
2 : That's true
3 : And do that. Do you wanna do that?
2 : But I mean need sure.
3 : Ok and then I'd get rid of an extra card and have more to discard later ok. Less to, ok.
2 : Yeah
2 : Cool
3 : So I'm moving, I'm getting rid of this.
2 : Ok
2 : And I'm here.
3 : Um
2 : Yeah
3 : And you're
3 : Oh but I already we already drew treasure cards so.
3 : I can't give you a card.
1 : No
2 : Yeah but only for next turn yeah. Yeah, yeah.
3 : Because that's but next turn. Ok, alrught
1 : But like
1 : Preparing for next turn.
2 : Ok
3 : Um so now we do flood cards
2 : Ok
3 : Phanton Rock and Cities of Abandon. Phantom Rock nothing on it.
2 : No, who cares about that.
1 : It's Cliffs of Abandon but yeah
3 : Or whoops.
2 : Ok
3 : Cliffs oh you flipped that, Ok so Phantom Rock I just sunk and that goes there.
1 : Mhmm
2 : Yeah
3 : And that goes to you and I'm done oh my God.
2 : Ok
2 : It's a little confusing yeah. Your turn
1 : Alright my turn.
3 : Hmm
1 : So I can do my actions
1 : so
1 : first action is to flip this.
1 : Um
1 : I don't know if I want, I don't think I want to move cause I've got these two so
2 : Ok
1 : Uh can I, two treasure cards? Por favor
2 : Yeah
2 : Si, Senorita.
1 : Oh shoot!
2 : Engineer
1 : You know what I should've done, I should've given one of these away.
2 : Oh
1 : So I didn't have to discardOh
1 : One
1 : Ok well
2 : Oh well
3 : Oh
1 : I guess wait I can keep five, I can keep five. Oh I forgot about that. Ok yeah, just discard that
3 : We're almost
2 : Ok
2 : Ok oh we are like close.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : So now I draw my flood card
2 : Or wait no move to the
1 : Wait
1 : I already drew my thing so I can't do the action yet.
2 : Oh, oh ok.
1 : Yeah
1 : So
2 : I'm like getting way excited.
1 : It's a game, it's a good game. Ok so Iron Gate.
2 : Yeah
1 : Or wait that's Silver Gate.
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Is Iron- Iron Gate's (--), so flip that for me please.
2 : Iron, ok.
3 : This one.
2 : And that's a good one to fly.
3 : bye bye
1 : Thank you and then
1 : Temple of the Moon oh no
2 : Ok
3 : Ok so we don't want this one to sink cause
1 : This goes here.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : No but
2 : Or like we could just keep this one alive.
3 : Well but then you risk what if that one sinks too. I think it's good to
1 : Yeah ok so
2 : Ok yeah.
3 : Keep the special ones.
2 : Ok my turn?
1 : Messenger, it's your turn.
2 : Um

3 : Oh right
3 : Ok
2 : Alright your turn
2 : Oh wait, can you, I don't think you can move diagonally.

3 : Hmm
2 : That could be for your turn then though
3 : Yeah
2 : Like give him that and fly him.
3 : How do you need for
2 : If we
3 : to get one of these things?
2 : Four.
3 : Ok
3 : Or I guess I could save this and then
3 : give him this one.
2 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Like give him that and then he could either make his way over there or like
3 : Ok
2 : one of us who has like a Helicopter Lift could just like fly him there
3 : Mmhmm
2 : I mean you are the Pilot so, so that's
3 : Hmm.
2 : fitting, ok.
2 : Um
2 : Alright, I'm gonna move to the Cliffs of Abandon. Oh draw flood cards equal to the Water level.

2 : Ok
2 : And then I have to draw flood cards equal to the water level
3 : Hmm
1 : There's the water level right there.
2 : Yeah, so three so Whispering Gardens- aw Temple of the Moon, ugh I was trying to save it. Yeah this is gone.
3 : No
1 : That's gone?
3 : Aw
1 : Whispering Garden will be turned over right?

3 : Yeah.
3 : Lift your team off Fools Landing (--)
3 : Um
3 : I don't know where I should
2 : Like if you flew
2 : you could fly either both of you guys or
2 : just him I think to the Cave of Embers and then when it's his turn next
2 : one of his actions could be capturing a treasure cause he has the four and he could just get that. Yeah.
3 : Oh yeah, yeah
2 : So whatever you think works.

2 : That's ok, capturing a treasure, discard four matching treasure cards while on the corresponding
3 : I

3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : Copper Gate
2 : Um
1 : I'll give you that.
2 : Oh you have to be on the same one as me to give me that.
1 : Ok
2 : Maybe if you took it back, could you move closer to me? Like maybe move here.
2 : Like if you reverse the move- I don't know if you can reverse moves or not.
3 : Mm yeah you could
2 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : And now I can give this to you, right?
2 : No you still, I'm right here. You have to wait until we're on the same one.
1 : Ok
1 : Alright and I'll take two cards.
2 : So
2 : Ok
2 : Wait if you only moved once do you want to move like three times and end up on the
2 : same one as me?
3 : Can you do that?
2 : Yeah cause you can move
2 : as like an action type you can chose three actions out of the four actions types so
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : And I can give that to you.
2 : ok no
2 : cause you moved three times. (--) I'm like oh this is stressful.
3 : Ok, yeah
2 : Alright
2 : Um
3 : Uh and then I guess take
3 : take those ones
2 : Yeah how many? three?
3 : mm
1 : Three yeah
2 : Yeah not that many left
2 : Cave of Shadows.
3 : Oh (God)
3 : (--)
2 : Twilight Hollow and what's the third one?
1 : Cave of Shadows.
1 : Say goodbye to that.
2 : S-yeah.
2 : Oh no I just flipped it. I flipped both of these.
3 : Oh no that one I already did.
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah so we're safe.
3 : And then what's the last?
2 : And the other one is
1 : Tw-
1 : Twilight Hollow
1 : Copper Gate
3 : Copper Gate
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : And then we ship these back in there right?
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah I think our biggest challenge with be getting to Fool's Landing.
2 : Yeah
1 : And we take these back right?
2 : Y-
2 : Yeah these just all stay here.
1 : There too
3 : Oh
2 : Oh ok
2 : Well
1 : It's your turn.
2 : Oh
2 : Wait how'd you end up on Fool's Landing?
2 : I feel like you were with
2 : you didn't move here, you were with me right?
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : Ok
3 : Oh
1 : Ok
2 : Oh so
2 : Oh
2 : Well
2 : Alright
3 : Mm
2 : Well I'm gonna
2 : shore up this one.
2 : And then I'm gonna move here.
2 : And I'm gonna
2 : Yes shore up this one that's my three actions, ok.
3 : (--)
2 : I'll take my two treasure cards, I don't need either of these.
2 : And
2 : Draw Flood cards equal to the water level oh.
2 : Rats, I can't do that
2 : because there's only one Flood card left.
2 : Alright I guess this will have to flood.
3 : Oh
2 : Flip
2 : Oh five cards in my hand, oh.
2 : Shame
2 : I'll put
2 : both of these back.
3 : Ok
2 : What?
3 : Ah
2 : Oh
2 : Ok
2 : Should we leave these here then?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Since we've gone through them all? ok.
2 : Twilight Hollow and Copper Gate.
3 : Hmm ok
2 : Ok yeah
3 : Mm
1 : (the heck)
2 : Ok well I guess
3 : Ok so now I'll shore up
2 : This is getting bad.
3 : This one
3 : Um
2 : Ok
3 : Should I m-
3 : I don't know if there's anything I can do.
3 : (--) ok.
3 : Alright
3 : I'll just
3 : Take these
3 : Oh great Water's Rise.
3 : And this one
2 : Awesome
2 : So
3 : Ok so move the
2 : It's up to four now.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Um ok shuffle the Flood whatever, ok can I have
3 : four?
2 : Yeah
2 : All four are gonna get uh so do we have to draw them all, that means we have to
2 : Flood them all?
2 : Ok
3 : And this is gone.
2 : This yeah, that's the
3 : Oh that one isn't it.
2 : Oh
3 : That one wasn't one.
2 : Wait this was gone?
3 : Oh no this is stil there cause I didn't draw that one.
2 : Oh
2 : Oh
3 : But I drew this one.
2 : Then where's this one's card?
1 : Right here.
2 : Oh ok
3 : Oh
2 : Oh oh well.
3 : Well
3 : That's ok
3 : Ok
2 : Um oh
2 : Put these here.
2 : Face it.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Wait
2 : Ok never mind, everyone.
3 : I'd
2 : Oh you can't.
3 : Yeah cause that's
2 : Yeah that's
3 : Like
1 : But I can shore up Cave of Shadows.
2 : Yeah no you can't move diagonally.
3 : No
3 : You can shore up only this one.
1 : Hmm
2 : Shore up Fool's Landing which like we kind of need to survive anyway.
3 : Yeah
1 : There we go.
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
3 : Now we really need to get
3 : -t
2 : Cause I feel like maybe in your next turn you could like
2 : fly to Temple, if it still exists. But
1 : Now take a couple cards.
2 : Never mind.
2 : Ok
2 : (never mind, I just)
3 : Hmm
3 : Hmm
2 : If we're still alive by the time your next turn comes.
3 : Who knows
2 : Um
2 : Alright
2 : Oh wait.
2 : You have way too many cards.
1 : Ooo yes.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Maybe
2 : I mean if she has that
1 : I need to get, I'll keep these.
2 : Then you could
2 : Yeah
1 : I'll get rid of these.
2 : How about you keep with that one and discard the fire one cause we don't have- need the fire one anymore.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : So
3 : Um
2 : Did you? Where are you in your turn?
3 : I think you have to draw
3 : The Forbidden
3 : I mean the
2 : The last one yeah
3 : That thing.
1 : Whispering Garden.
3 : And then maybe we have to shuffle those?
2 : Yeah shuffle them in
3 : And then
3 : Well actually you have to draw all f- all four at- all four of them because
2 : Oh yeah cause we're on four.
3 : Was that four?
2 : Ok well
2 : Well I'm dead. So, cause I can't move here.
1 : Fool's Landing
1 : Cave of Shadows, Temple of the Sun, and Whispering Garden.
2 : Does that, does that mean we lose?
3 : I think we lost.
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Well
2 : That means these are all
3 : Sure we lost.
2 : Yeah we've lost in multiple ways. Ok. Yeah there's me. I'm dead.
3 : Yep
2 : (like)

2 : Ok
4 : Ok
3 : Uh
3 : Um
1 : Oh
4 : So let's
1 : I go first
3 : Would
4 : Let's give you the cards for the green thing, if we get them and-
2 : Yeah, I feel like you should move and try to shore up tiles.
1 : Shore up all these things? These-
2 : Yeah, as much as you-
3 : (Yeah)
3 : What color are you? Red?
1 : Red
1 : Red, yeah.
2 : Yeah, so she's at bronze gate.
3 : So, can you move there and then shore up that and-
1 : Mmhmm yeah
4 : Mm mmhmm
3 : Oh, you can only do-
1 : That's three.
2 : Yeah
2 : That's fine.
3 : Moving is one.
1 : Moving
2 : Moving's one and then shoring up the one you're on and then she has her- isn't her power to-
2 : Shore up
2 : Two
1 : Do two? yeah.
3 : Oh ok, yeah
1 : For one action
2 : Yeah, that makes sense
2 : That's good.
3 : Ok so you can like move here and shore up all-
1 : Well does that mean I can do four, though?
1 : Like
2 : Shore up both of those and then move and then shore up two more.
1 : Like move
1 : Shore these two up
3 : No, cause you'd only have one action left.
2 : Alright, you could, you could shore up these two first.
4 : Uh
3 : Like moving
4 : Right
2 : Move, shore up these two.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Oh
3 : That's four moves
2 : Shore up
2 : Oh wait, is that shore up for- is that for two?
1 : Hm?
2 : Hold on, what's your-
1 : Shore up two tiles
2 : For one action
4 : Right
3 : Like it's be move-
2 : You could shore up these two
4 : Do you shore up
4 : Move, eh-
1 : You can't do-
2 : That's, that's one
3 : Oh 'k, yeah no, you're right. You're right.
1 : Not diagonal, though.
2 : Move and then shore up two.
3 : Yeah, yeah you don't have to-
4 : Right, right right right
1 : I don't think I can do them diagonal
2 : No those aren't diagonal. These are adjacent.
4 : Here-
3 : No like-
1 : Ok.
3 : Move one
2 : No no no, adja-
3 : never mind, action one.
2 : Uh flip these two first
3 : Yeah yeah
4 : I think there's a number of ways you could do it
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah just-
3 : I think-
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok so that's the first move
2 : That's the first move
3 : And then you move to the Temple of the Moon
4 : Right right
2 : Yeah, and then-
2 : Shore up these two
3 : And then shore up those and that's three-
1 : And then shore these up
3 : Three
1 : That's three moves. Ok.
2 : Yeah
3 : Actions
2 : Ok
2 : And then
2 : Two treasure deck cards
2 : Oh crap
1 : And I have to do this one immediately?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : (so, do that)
2 : And then-
2 : You have to-
4 : Can I see that card?
1 : Do we have to put, shuffle these in now?
2 : Yeah
4 : Ok
2 : Move the water, then shuffle, discard, then place on top
2 : And then discard the water- ok done.
2 : And then you have to-
2 : Draw that equal to the water level so two
1 : Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Lost Lagoon
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : Um so I'm at Silver Gate
2 : And what do you guys think?
1 : What's your-
1 : power?
2 : My power is yeah, I can just give treasure cards. But all I have are these two.
1 : Give treasure cards
3 : Does it count as a move?
2 : Um
2 : Yeah so if I give of them to you guys it counts as a move.
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : But at this point-
3 : I don't think it-
1 : There's nothing-
3 : Makes sense yet.
2 : Yeah I feel like I should just shore up Cliffs-
2 : Cliffs of Abandon in case that gets shuffled.
3 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : Wait, can you do it that way?
1 : (Wait wait)
2 : Yeah but I'd have to go one, two and then I'd still have one move,
1 : Oh ok
1 : Ok
1 : One, two and then-
1 : Ok
2 : And then-
2 : Do- do you want to start collecting the gold ones?
1 : Wait, wasn't that three moves already?
2 : Uh
4 : Um
2 : It's one, two.
1 : One
3 : Yeah
1 : Two and then shoring up.
2 : And then, oh yeah. You're right, you're right.
1 : So that's-
4 : Yeah, why not?
3 : Or couldn't you just move to he- like just have, just move to there and flip it cause you're right next to it?
2 : Oh, that's true. Ok, so-
3 : So then-
1 : Ok so one
3 : You can
2 : One, two
3 : If you really want to give him that one
1 : Two
2 : And then
2 : Do you want-
2 : do you want to start-
4 : Yeah why not? I'm-
2 : Ok
4 : Provisionally
4 : Gettin' the gold ones
2 : Alright
1 : And then-
2 : Draw two, wait, right?
3 : Yeah
2 : Two treasure deck cards
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Oh, crap. I should've given you that one.
2 : Um, that was dumb.
3 : And then the-
2 : And then
3 : Flood
2 : The flood tiles, so two.
3 : Yeah
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Phantom Rock.
2 : Breaker's
3 : Well
2 : Oh
2 : 'k
3 : Do you have the card?
2 : Yeah, Breaker's Bridge. Or is that Phantom Rock?
3 : Phantom Rock
2 : Um, where's this one?
2 : Oh, 'k.
3 : Ok.
1 : And you got-
1 : Yeah, ok.
2 : So
2 : Pilot, blue, on Fool's Landing.
3 : Um should I go-
3 : Like
3 : I can move anywhere so should I move here and then shore both of those?
4 : Well she's right near them and she can do two at once.
2 : Yeah so she could (do)- right.
4 : So you probably want to do that one if you're gonna shore one up.
3 : Oh, good call.
1 : What is that little yellow thing?
2 : That just means that's where yellow starts but we don't have a yellow person.
1 : Oh ok. Got it.
3 : So does it- it doesn't matter whether I move here or here, though. Like-
3 : Should I-
3 : Stay here?
1 : I mean if we lost Golden Gate would it-
1 : Like matter?
2 : No
2 : I guess not but-
4 : (It's) on an edge.
2 : Like I get-
3 : It's just- it's just like
3 : It's not like I've-
4 : Yeah
2 : How many do we wanna- yeah it's not like she has much else to do.
3 : (Better) Better things to do
1 : That's true.
3 : Unless
3 : Like
2 : Uh
4 : Well maybe-
1 : Why not?
3 : 'Cause we might not make it back around to you before these-
4 : Better than nothing 'cause what if it's like we need to get, like, to this thing to get the gold ones.
1 : Yeah
3 : Go down
2 : Oh wait, actually, maybe-
1 : That's true, yeah.
4 : So
2 : If-
2 : If we get a flood card or something and then these get drawn up
2 : Soon it might make sense to at least turn over some of these
3 : Yeah, cause this isn't already pulled up, right?
2 : Yeah, that one's not there.
3 : So why don't I move here?
3 : And then shore this, too.
2 : Just, yeah.
2 : Fix those.
3 : So that's three moves
3 : Um
3 : And these two
4 : (--)
3 : Ok I got another Helicopter Lift card and-
2 : Ok
3 : You have two of those, ok.
4 : How did you shore up two of them?
2 : Well she moved to one, yeah.
3 : I- my power is to move anywhere
3 : As an action.
4 : Oh right, right. I understand.
3 : Uh ok, so gold- uh well ok, bye.
2 : It's gone now
3 : Can you look- oh there's the card and-
2 : And then the purple one is Temple of the Moon
3 : Mm
2 : Oh I guess this should be, eh it doesn't- they're already shuffled.
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
4 : So I'll just move and uh shore that one up. I don't see anything else I can do.
2 : Ok
4 : So
2 : Shore that
2 : And then you need to go to a golden one
4 : I guess I will move
4 : Yeah, I guess I'll move in this-
2 : That one's closer, though
4 : Direct, oh there's two of them
2 : Well
3 : Just like, you could move towards it
2 : Yeah
3 : Like, you need four before you can do it anyway
2 : Misty, yeah
4 : Yeah, I'll just stay in this area and I'll plan to-
2 : That's fine.
4 : Discard down there.Ok, um-
2 : Here's two cards
4 : Two treasure cards
2 : And then
2 : Did you get a flood one? No.
4 : No
2 : Solid. Ok you have five. Ok, no more for you.
4 : Ok, Whispering Garden and Iron-
2 : What are they?
4 : Gate.
2 : Iron Gate.
1 : Ok
3 : Wait, these don't have to be used during my turn, do they?
2 : They can use- be used at any time.
3 : Ok, well just so you know I have two Helicopter Lifts
2 : Yeah
4 : Look at that
1 : So giving a treasure card is a move, right?
1 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
1 : If we needed to do that
2 : And don't worry, I can also give-
4 : Ok
2 : Cards
2 : Like right? I can give-
1 : You can't give other people's cards
4 : (You)
2 : Ok, so you could give me one of your cards if you wanted to-
2 : I don't know
1 : Oh, that's true.
4 : Ok, so let's say Pilot-
1 : So it's my turn
1 : Oh
2 : Yeah
4 : Oh, sorry. I was saying, Pilot, why don't you take the purple treasure because you have one.
1 : No, you're fine
2 : Yeah
4 : And
2 : We don't need to collect all of them so the ones that are out the most- all of these are out.
2 : So
2 : Maybe
4 : So I'll need to give, give that to, to on the next-
1 : People need to start giving me
2 : Yeah, start giving them to you, right.
1 : Ok. So then I should just give this maybe to somebody or should I try to do something else?
4 : To you on the next turn
2 : Engineer, at this point it doesn't really matter. Ok, so you're trying to go to a place where there's- there's this.
3 : It doesn't real- it doesn't really matter nnmm.
1 : Yeah
4 : Right, right
2 : So you should move like over this way, or that way. It doesn't matter.
1 : Ok
2 : Uh maybe move-
1 : Just move, the whole time?
2 : Move two and then give that to me, I guess?
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
4 : Or you could, you might want to shore- that might be a good idea
1 : I shouldn't try to shore anything up
2 : Oh yeah actually Whispering Gardens, yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok so one, two, and then shore it up.
2 : cause
3 : Yeah
1 : I don't have to be on it
3 : No
2 : Wait, yours is shore up two tiles and just- yeah ok yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah but
3 : yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Right
1 : One, two
2 : Sounds good
1 : Ok
1 : treasure
1 : She can
1 : move us all if she wanted to.
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Water's Rise
2 : Water Rise
3 : Uh
1 : Oh oh
2 : Alright
2 : so then shuffle the flood discard pile, if you wanna do that. Then place it on top.
2 : Then put that there.
1 : (--)
2 : Ok
2 : and then you take- you take your treasure cards
1 : And now I need to
1 : do these.
2 : And then
1 : Ok
2 : Mm
2 : No, no, no, you don't- Wait did you already do that
3 : No
3 : Yes
1 : No
3 : Wait cause you got
1 : Cause I got a Water's card
3 : Oh this is a treasure card, yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : Yeah so now she has to take
1 : I have to take three
3 : Oh god
3 : ok
4 : Someone's gonna have to explain the whole like
1 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Iron
2 : Iron Gate
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Iron Gate's gone now.
1 : Ok
2 : Um Cliffs of Abandon
2 : here
2 : and then Breaker's Bridge
2 : is here, ok.
3 : And then, that's it.
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
3 : Your turn.
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok so I am
3 : Do you wanna
2 : Misty Marsh
3 : give your card-
3 : Oh but you also probably wanna flip things
2 : Yeah ok so I'm
3 : You could flip that as one,
2 : Mmhmm
3 : give that as one,
4 : You can, you can give it to me.
2 : Right
4 : You don't need to give it to me right now
3 : Oh if you
1 : You can't because he'll lose one of his. Or you can
3 : Wait
4 : Well then
1 : It's ok, I guess if he loses it
3 : But then
4 : We should decide which um-
4 : Sorry
3 : You don't wanna discard
4 : We need three of the four so sometime, maybe not now, but we should decide which of the ones we're not going to get, to pursue
1 : Yeah
2 : To get which one
3 : I'll take these
2 : Well cause three of those are- The purple one's already out, the gold one's already out and the
2 : they're all four of the
3 : So we're
1 : So get rid of the fire
4 : So
2 : Get rid of their fire ones
3 : Don't care about that, but you don't have one of those, so you can't get that to him yet
4 : Fire
4 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : So that means you definitely don't wanna
3 : Yeah
3 : you need all of yours.
2 : You need- Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : (um shore up) hmm
2 : I get to shore up both of those
1 : Ok
2 : I don't know what else I would do
1 : Do we need-
1 : What's the sandbag do?
2 : Oh we can shore up these at any time
1 : Shore up any of the tile- Oh ok
2 : So
2 : I mean
1 : Ok
1 : So we don't have to do that yet.
4 : (--)
4 : Since we're all near this to shore up maybe you should
4 : give me one of the golden ones cause one of us will probably have a
2 : No we can't give you the golden right one cause all- you can only hold five and every single one of those is important right now.
3 : because you have to discard them.
4 : Oh
4 : He can't give it if I have five, I see, ok
2 : Right, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : No, that's a move
2 : Or I can but then you have to discard one and we need all of those.
3 : Yeah
4 : Right, right, I understand
3 : yeah
3 : So
3 : Ok
2 : Um
3 : Why don't you
1 : Hmm
3 : I mean like I don't know if it's worth doing this now but you could like shore this up cause you're next to it
2 : Yeah
3 : and then use that card for this one.
2 : Well so I have three turns, so I could
2 : move, shore up,
2 : move
2 : and that would (--) ok
3 : Yeah
1 : We give four
2 : Fair, and then should I just do that?
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Move and then here and then shore this up
1 : Wait wasn't that four turns?
3 : You-
3 : That was four turns, so just like
1 : Then you can't shore it up
2 : Oh just kidding, stay here
2 : Oh I can't shore that one up
3 : Use the- I was saying use this card
2 : Oh ok
2 : Sure
3 : So
1 : Oh ok if you use that you should
1 : yeah
3 : And then
2 : Then
4 : Hmm
2 : draw two
3 : Yeah
2 : More sandbags and a lion
2 : Are there- Ok
2 : And then
2 : one, two, and three
3 : Three
2 : Lost Lagoon,
2 : um
2 : Temple Moon and Whispering Garden
3 : Alright
3 : Is this me now?
3 : Ok does anyone need to move anywhere or
4 : Someone need- No everyone's in a good location.
3 : I, I could just make these two of my moves
3 : you know?
1 : Do you wanna give me that
1 : um
2 : Yeah the chalice
3 : Oh yeah
4 : Yeah you should- Let's start giving each other the
1 : Chalice
3 : Sure, ok. One, two, three. Is that ok if I flip these as my other two actions?
2 : Yeah that sounds fine.
2 : Oh just kidding
2 : (--)
3 : Oh just kidding
2 : Just kidding
1 : Oh it has to be in the same one
2 : Bring it back
2 : That's only me
3 : That's your power, ok
3 : Um
1 : Who
3 : I
1 : What color are you?
3 : could
3 : I'm blue so it would take me like my whole turn to give it to you.
1 : Oh yeah
4 : Oh yeah cause you have to be in the same- on the same like
3 : Should I
1 : S-
4 : place to exchange.
2 : Um
1 : So shoring these up is two moves, right?
3 : Should I just shore those two?
4 : I didn't realize (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah and I feel like if you're gonna draw three anyways, like three flood cards, it's probably likely that we're gonna have to like start flooding and like losing things.
1 : Yeah I'd shore them up.
3 : So that's-
3 : Should I just do that?
2 : Yeah
3 : And do
1 : Wouldn't I lose the lion?
3 : I
3 : Is there anything else like
2 : Um wait you wanna- Who, both of
2 : Who's the red and the green?
2 : Ok Explorer. Ok, you could fly the Explorer to here, Howling Gardens
1 : I'm the red.
2 : and then next time I can give both of mine to him
4 : Oh huh
2 : and then he can take the treasure.
4 : Yeah
3 : But you would have to use his moves to like give me those or something.
4 : I can do that.
3 : Ok, so
2 : Yeah
3 : I'm lifting
2 : Both the
1 : Well that means he'd have to be on the same tile as you to give
4 : Yeah wait, wh- which, which color are you?
3 : Oh
2 : But sh-
3 : Ok, I- If I use my, if I use the Lift
4 : Let's stay close together so we can
3 : put him on the same tile as me, he can give them
1 : Yeah
3 : right after I'm done.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Right, right
3 : And then
3 : I can use my- I have two cards so I can- like after you give them
1 : Then he can start
2 : Yeah
1 : He can go over there
3 : Do you have to give those during your turn?
2 : Um yeah
4 : Yeah, it takes an action to, to give, to give um
2 : It takes- Yeah so this would give me- It would take two of my actions
2 : Um but currently he's really, like next to me so he could- he could move and then give both to me
2 : And then
2 : You
2 : Could somehow
2 : Then someone else can get on my tile
2 : So the Engineer could get on my tile and then we could fly to Howling Gardens and get this one done
4 : Wait, who?
3 : Ok
4 : Who's giving the golden one's in? I don't- I don't care
4 : Is it you or uh, eh-
3 : Wait, just to finish up my turn, since these- these don't count
2 : It- it depends.
3 : A move
2 : Mmhmm
3 : So how about I just like finish the rest and when we get to him we'll figure out
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : What we're gonna do.
3 : Ok
2 : Oh, there's multiple
3 : And I have to discard one which is this-
3 : Does it go in here?
3 : Or no, here.
2 : Uh, actually wait. You should get rid of the gold one cause we don't need that one anymore
1 : Yeah
2 : If he's get- well-
2 : You could give-
4 : A gold one?
2 : (Don't we-)
4 : (Why don't) we need the gold one
1 : Well we're not using the fire one.
3 : Yeah, let's just get rid of this one.
2 : Yeah, ok.
4 : You mean the fire one?
2 : Well, if say if I- if I redeemed- like if you uh like ended giving me both of those gold cards and I redeemed it for the statue
2 : Then
2 : We'd have a fire- uh I don't know.
1 : Yeah
3 : But we don't need all of them, do we?
4 : I thought we agreed we weren't using the fire one.
3 : Like we don't-
3 : Do we need all of the treasures?
2 : No no no, we don't need all of the treasures but-
2 : I just- I don't know
2 : Worst case scenario or something
4 : I don't understand that
3 : I would- I would just say like I don't-
2 : Just- yeah, ok.
3 : I feel like it's better to have a fifth on of these in case then-
1 : Yeah
2 : In case? Ok.
3 : Like a-
3 : A third one of these. Like that's not gonna do much for us. Ok.
2 : Yeah
3 : And then what?
3 : Three of those
3 : Copper Gate
2 : Temple of Sun
2 : Crimson Forest and what's the last one?
2 : There.
3 : Copper Gate
3 : Alright
4 : Ok, so I will-
4 : Flip these two over
4 : Or should I spend the two
3 : I think-
3 : Mm
4 : Ok what-
1 : Wait
4 : Which- I'm green. I'm sorry, I confused those two colors.
1 : Ok
1 : Were you gonna fly him and he was gonna use his turn to give these?
1 : To her
3 : Then I would have to dis-
1 : Her
3 : Well no. I'd only have discard one
3 : If I used a helicopter
2 : Yes
2 : So he could move one, use one turn0 like one of his turns-
2 : Then you'd fly us both here. And then he could use the rest of his two turns to give me those two things and then the next time I would play I could redeem it for a treasure
1 : To fly two people do they have to be on the same thing, to start with?
2 : Yeah
3 : So, you do wanna flip-
3 : Is- is what you're saying is that he flips and then I move you?
2 : No no no, he would have to move- we'd have to be together. Then you'd have to redeem the helicopter thing and then we'd both be here. He'd have to give me both cards and those would each be a turn.
2 : Does that make sense?
4 : Ok I'm- I'm- I'm confused. What do you want me to do, Messenger? Messenger, what do you-
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, yeah no I get it
3 : Ok
3 : (--)
4 : It's unclear to me what exactly you're- you're asking me to do. I'm- I'm confused.
3 : (--)
3 : To give her these.
3 : So, action one-
2 : Yeah, so I could redeem these for the next time.
4 : Ok
3 : This is you, right? Action one-
4 : Ok
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Is a move.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Then I'll use my card.
2 : To move us both
2 : Here, to Howling Gardens
3 : There.
2 : And then you still have two turns left, so you would give me
3 : You have two turns
3 : Giver her those.
2 : Those
2 : The two gold ones.
2 : Makes sense
1 : And you have-
1 : Too many. So you have to-
2 : I have five.
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh and then this one. So, fire, yeah.
1 : So you have to get rid of the fire.
3 : So get rid of that.
3 : Ok
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Water Rise and goblet.
2 : Alright, Water Rise.
2 : And then shuffle these
2 : How much time do we have?
1 : Eighteen more minutes.
3 : Eighteen?
2 : Oh, eighteen, oh uh
1 : Or else we lose
2 : Great
2 : Oh great. So uh, speed it up.
2 : Um, ok. So then Water Rise and then you got your treasure and you're done- is that everything?
1 : Oh so it's my turn.
3 : No
4 : No, I did not draw-
2 : Your turn
3 : He-
2 : We didn't-
3 : Didn't do the-
4 : I did draw-
3 : You didn't do the flood cards, right?
4 : No, um
1 : Ok, so you need three.
2 : (Oh) the flood cards, sorry.
4 : Oh Temple of the Moon-
1 : Uh oh.
1 : Ok
2 : Temple
2 : Yeah
1 : Cliffs
2 : Of Abandon
4 : And Lost Lagoon
3 : Oh, that's fine. We're just-
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Woah
4 : Ok
2 : And now
1 : I have some serious shoring up to do.
3 : Yeah
3 : Can-
3 : Are you the one- you can do multiple in one move?
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Two
3 : Can you do diagonally? Oh, no.
1 : No
4 : No, I can it diagonally, yeah.
1 : I can't do them diagonal.
3 : Ok, so you could do these two, move-
3 : Just kid- yeah. These two, move, these two?
1 : No
2 : Yeah she could do these two, move-
4 : Two and then-
2 : And then
3 : Oh, just kidding.
1 : That's diagonal.
2 : Oh, no wait, yeah. Shoot.
3 : You can only do two.
4 : (--)
3 : Um
1 : Could do move-
2 : Uh
1 : No
1 : (--)
4 : Well this would be the least important one because it's in like a corner.
2 : Mm
1 : Ok
3 : One, two, three.
2 : And we don't even really need Whispering Gardens anyways. We actually don't.
1 : Ok
3 : Right?
1 : Ok
2 : Do see what I'm say- cause (that's)- we already have this one, we're gonna be done.
2 : So, you could just do these two
2 : Move
2 : This one?
4 : Yeah, this no util- this has absolutely no utility and this has minimal utility.
3 : That would work.
2 : Crimson- yeah.
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
3 : Right, so-
1 : Ok, so do these two-
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Then move over to Silver Gate and then Temple of the Moon.
1 : Ok
2 : Cool. Ok, so then my first- oh and then you need to do the stuff.
1 : And I'm gonn have too many treasures.
3 : Here
2 : Ok
1 : (--)
2 : And then you need to do three.
2 : So Whispering- Breaker's Bridge
1 : We lost Whispering Garden
4 : Oh
2 : Breaker's Bridge is gone and Crimson Forest. Where's Crimson Forest?
4 : (--)
1 : That's gone too.
2 : Oh ok
2 : that's fine.
1 : Alright
2 : Um ok so my turn. So then- No you're done- Or, those were your flood cards weren't they?
3 : No, no, no
1 : No
1 : No- Yeah they were
2 : No- Oh wait
1 : Yeah
3 : They were. I'm so confused, I don't remember what just happened, but yeah.
2 : Yeah
4 : (--)
1 : Yeah they were
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah, oh yeah, ok
1 : they were.
2 : So then these four get redeemed for the treasure thing.
2 : I don't know- Well
1 : But why
3 : But
4 : Hmm why are flood cards being put in here? Shouldn't they stay in that pile?
3 : Because they're
2 : Once they're gone
3 : No because they're, they're
2 : then they don't ever get revived.
3 : done, they're sunk.
1 : We can't have those back.
2 : We can't have them again.
3 : Um ok wait (--)
2 : Alright
3 : No just get
2 : so
1 : So we've captured a
1 : treasure.
2 : Yeah you captured a treasure so if you discard four treasures
1 : And that counts as one of your turns I think
2 : Yeah mmhmm
3 : Yeah it does.
2 : Ok so that's done
2 : and then, I, I- Do we move them?
3 : Yeah you can have it.
2 : Ok
1 : You can just hold onto that
2 : Um and then
2 : What should I do- (--)
3 : So that was one turn right? Ok so
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : I can't shore up anything
2 : but
3 : I can move you
2 : Yeah I guess you could move us both
2 : Um you have
1 : That's true (--)
2 : three goblets so
4 : Yeah
2 : there's that- If we move both
2 : Oh you have two and you have two
2 : Uh maybe- And you're over, all the way over there. Shoot.
4 : (--) the
4 : It might be good too for me to shore this up if we need both of the
4 : these in case one of them sinks, I don't know, it's just an idea.
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok who's, who's blue again?
3 : Me
2 : Oh Pilot, ok
2 : Um
1 : Well what's the next treasure which we're gonna get?
1 : Maybe
3 : Um
2 : Yeah I think either the purple or the blue
4 : Yeah it's unclear to me who is doing what in terms of the treasure
3 : Yeah
2 : So you're closest to purple so I think next time
2 : you guys should start giving her the purple things
3 : Ok
3 : mmhmm
4 : We should exchange- We should get in the same location and we should spend our turns- I should get four of the purple and or green or vice versa so we exchange
1 : That
2 : Oh yeah like exchange and then capture, yeah
1 : We can't exchange though, but
1 : You can just give. Yeah no I get it.
4 : Why why
3 : Well no like on his turn he can give two to you
2 : So somehow like get to the same places
4 : On our turns
3 : Oh no
1 : Yeah it won't work really
3 : I see what you're saying cause you would have to end up discarding something.
1 : But there's more I think
3 : You could
3 : give some to me- I have one of each like I don't know what that does, but
4 : Can we- Which- You're red, you're red, you're over here
1 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
4 : I'm over here
2 : We can get pretty close, yeah
4 : so my strategy will be to move towards your area to facilitate an exchange
2 : You might as well just fly like you could just fly us both to Temple Moon
4 : Yeah
1 : To the Temple of the Moon?
2 : Yeah
3 : Right now?
4 : That's a good idea.
3 : Are you gonna do a move now or
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah and then I guess I can shore up Breaker's Bridge or something. So how many turns do I have left?
3 : yeah.
2 : Oh two
3 : Two, you just captured
1 : You did one
3 : so you have two actions, right?
2 : So- Yeah I have two. Ok so should I move here and then get Lost Lagoon as well? Like one and then shore up
1 : Ok
2 : Or no, no, move and shore up I guess. Or I can shore up here, right?
4 : And what
4 : So what, what have you done so far on your turn? I'm
2 : All I did was capture this, so that's one turn. I still have two actions left.
2 : So
2 : I can flip this tile
1 : Ok
2 : Right and then
2 : and then I have one more turn so I don't know,
2 : move closer to something else or
3 : You don't have to use it.
2 : Yeah, I guess there's no point.
1 : Oh that's true, yeah.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah.
2 : And I'll need two
4 : Wait why don't you- You'd wanna flip the Lost Lagoon because if instead of sinking it's shored up that
2 : I can't
2 : it's
2 : diagonal.
3 : He can't.
1 : There's no
2 : It's diagonal, I can't.
3 : She can't.
1 : She doesn't have enough turns left.
2 : Yeah I only have one
4 : Uh which color are you?
2 : I'm, I'm silver
4 : You're silver, ok I was confused, I thought you were the blueone.
2 : Yeah
2 : No that's the Pilot. Alright so I have two fire- It's ok
1 : Ok so you got fire
4 : I'm sorry
2 : Two fires and then three flood tiles.
2 : Alright Tidal Palace
2 : and Temple of the Sun.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Eh (--)
3 : Mm I don't know
1 : We lost it.
2 : Wait how is that
2 : ok.
3 : Oh
2 : There you go
2 : and Copper Gate.
3 : So we can't let
2 : Ok
3 : that go.
1 : Nnhmm
1 : (--) sandbags (--)
3 : Ok
3 : Um so
4 : Ok
3 : flood
3 : cards.
2 : (--)
3 : Did you- oh you just pulled them. Oh my god I swear- Ok, I got it. I'm like what's going on.
2 : Yeah I just did them, it's your turn. It's ok there's a lot to keep track of.
2 : Um
3 : so
2 : You can fly to any ok
3 : Does anyone want a card?
1 : Am I getting these?
3 : Oh wait I have an idea
1 : bowls?
4 : Well what else (--) right now it doesn't- it's
4 : doesn't matter which one. So you- Do you like green or purple? Which color do you prefer?
2 : Yeah
2 : Completely even
3 : I have an idea
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : I have an idea. Ok so if I use one of my turns to give
1 : Doesn't matter.
3 : one of thse
4 : Well Engineer- Which one, which one are you going to take? Which one would you like?
1 : Well let's hear what she has to say
2 : It doesn't matter- Yeah
3 : It doesn't matter cause we all have like equal amounts of both. So if I give one or the other
4 : It doesn't matter
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
3 : to you on this turn
3 : then on your turn
3 : your goal would be to give
3 : two of which ever one I don't give you to her and then
3 : like
3 : since there's an extra like you could sacrifice like
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah
3 : discarding one.
2 : Yeah it- If, if that's the case then you should give him the purple one because um yeah cause then you could take Temple Moon and then
3 : Ok
3 : Do I have to be on the same thing?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah so
1 : to give
4 : Ok I'll take the purple ones and turn them in and you'll take the green ones, Engineer
2 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : So should I
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok so my move idea is to
3 : um
3 : what do you call it? Shore, move
2 : And give, yeah
1 : And give, yeah
3 : Give
4 : Mmhmm, mmhmm
2 : That makes sense.
1 : Ok
2 : Alright and then two
3 : Ok
2 : and then
2 : provided it's not, ok.
2 : And then it's Cave of Shadows
2 : and Silver- What?
2 : Silver Gate
2 : and
3 : Dunes of Deception
3 : None of which really matter
2 : Dunes of (--)
2 : None- Yeah none are important
2 : Ok
1 : We don't really wanna lose this, it might make it hard to move around.
2 : Yeah
4 : Ok so I'll- I can shore that up and I'll give you
2 : Especially cause that's central
3 : Right
4 : I can give you two, right?
3 : You're on the same- Oh ok
1 : Ok so wait we're on the same
4 : Cause I can do it diagonally
3 : No
3 : So you're on the- Are you on the same tile? No
4 : Yes
3 : No, cause that's her
1 : No I'm red, so you might wanna move.
4 : Oh you're red. I can move.
3 : So
3 : here's your actions
3 : Move here,
3 : give two.
4 : And give two
1 : Ok
4 : Ok I think that's more logical than spending the time to shore up the center square wouldn't
2 : Well but then you have to
4 : Does everyone agree with that, cause there's two choices here?
2 : Yeah that's fine.
2 : Yeah
3 : Wait or use, use that- No, no, no, here idea- Use that Helicopter card
1 : But then I can
1 : To
3 : to move him to you, then it doesn't use an- require an action from him
1 : to move him.
4 : Well
2 : That's a good idea.
1 : Ok
3 : And then you don't have to discard
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
4 : Right, I see, I see, that's a good idea. I'm green, yes.
3 : Are you- What color are you?
3 : Ok, so then
1 : I
1 : these two.
3 : You still have
1 : Three, yeah.
3 : Three moves, yeah
4 : So I will give
2 : Both of those to her.
3 : Yeah
4 : Both of these to you
3 : And you can discard one of them- Yeah
2 : One of- Yeah
1 : And then should he
3 : Cause I still have one just in case.
4 : Ok
1 : shore up?
4 : And then
3 : Yeah
4 : Does it, does it- Two- Do I take two actions and give you two cards or
1 : The Silver Gate
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : But that was
1 : But I Helicopter Lifted you
4 : But you Helicoptered me over. Right
3 : That was your two actions
2 : And then you still- but you still need to move so you should move here cause you're gonna redeem that purple one soon.
2 : Cause the next
1 : Well no he should shore this up
4 : I should shore it up
3 : It doesn't matter as much as getting the treasure I think
2 : It isn't- Cause yeah, you need to get the treasure, more importantly.
1 : Ok
1 : Oh that's true.
3 : So I think that should be your
2 : Cause you're not gonna swim or flood or anything, you'll be fine.
3 : third action.
3 : So
4 : So what
2 : He'll be ok
3 : So move here so that like next turn she can- Oh wait maybe you wanna stay, you wanna stay
2 : Yeah
4 : So we're on the same tile to facilitate a transfer
4 : Well we should be on the same square
3 : Will you be able
1 : We probably should stay on the same one so I can give him the
2 : Ok yeah then (--) just wait.
4 : It's logical to shore it up if I understand the rules correctly.
3 : But no, no, no how
3 : if, if he moves now, you can use a move
3 : to move to him and give him the card.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Cause he- If it- It's better- Isn't it better- Or no, capturing a treasure has to happen in his turn anyway
1 : Does anyone else have a Helicopter card right now? No
2 : No
3 : No
4 : No, so I should
1 : Are you able to Lift, are you able to move me anywhere during your turn?
3 : Ok I think
2 : If there's another person with you
3 : I think it's just me.
3 : No, no, no that's
4 : Ok so I'm going to shore this up with my last move
2 : Oh no that's the Helicopter card, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : That's just me, just me, yeah.
1 : You can only move yourself.
4 : Ex- Excuse me, I'm gonna shore this up with my last action.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, I think that's probably
3 : the best.
1 : Ok so I can't get this treasure yet
4 : Ok
4 : Ok so I need two treasure cards
1 : So you need to- Yeah
2 : And then three flood cards
4 : Mm
2 : So it's these three
2 : Bronze Gate,
4 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Cave of Embers and the tornadoey one.
3 : Ok
2 : Alright, your turn.
2 : Engineer, so
1 : So
1 : I need to get down there but I can't this turn.
4 : So if you'd want to spend
3 : I think that
3 : you- Ok first step, give him the purple.
4 : You'd want to give me a purple and um as one of your actions.
2 : Yeah
4 : Thank you
2 : And then throw away the red I guess
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Oh yeah- No why don't you just throw away the blue on- the blue just in case.
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Cause it doesn't- We already- we're done.
3 : I mean I think we already got rid of too many of these to be able to do it but
4 : Right so you're- You, you have red so it looks like it's logical that
2 : I 'll still have red- Yeah
4 : (--)
2 : Maybe if- But both of these might go under, yeah.
3 : There's not
1 : Ok
4 : changing the original plan that you will get the red and try to turn them in.
1 : So one,
1 : hmm
2 : Um
3 : Should you just try to get closer to here?
1 : Yeah like two
4 : Mmhmm
3 : That's all you're trying to do right? To just go there
2 : Yeah yeah
4 : Yeah that seems logical
1 : Yeah just move to like Breaker's Bridge or something
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Uh Water Rises so here you go
3 : Mm
4 : Yeah we should start thinking of getting Cliffs to Fool's Landing if we have extra turns
1 : Wait can I
3 : We need to be able to
1 : Ok so I got a Helicopter so I can move myself
3 : Ok that's good.
1 : somewhere but I can't do this this turn
1 : anyways so.
3 : Yeah save that for when you're getting the treasure I guess.
2 : Ok um and then you just took those and now you need to take three flood cards.
1 : Temple of the Moon, Howling Garden
1 : and Cave of Shadows.
2 : Howling Garden's gone.

2 : Ah we need to hussle.
2 : Yeah I was just

3 : Ok

2 : Right (--) we gotta, we gotta go.
2 : Alright cool alright and then three of these.

2 : Ok
4 : Yeah, I guess, I guess there's no clear rule about
3 : Cause we're gonna
2 : Yeah, alright so then you need two of these

4 : for sequential actions if you immediately make an action and take it back I suppose.
3 : don't-
3 : Ok does she have to finish her turn or can we like fly
2 : Wait, wait
3 : and go off the island now?
4 : So if we have three- Do we have three of the four treasures, I'm a little confused. Ok

4 : You can't move diagonally, correct?
2 : Right, yeah
1 : Oh yeah we're gonna have to fly
2 : so
2 : The p-
4 : Mmkay this is problematic.
3 : Well we just all have to get to the same tile and use that card.
1 : So it's your turn so try to get somewhere
2 : But we need to get to Fool's Landing though, right?
3 : You can use your turn to get here.
1 : No I'm red
2 : Yeah she's red. I'm, I'm gray.

2 : Ok
3 : Oh well
3 : the- I mean
2 : Yeah so flip one, two, and or
2 : I can flip adjacent and then (--) the same one.
3 : Ok here's how it's gonna work. We'll use a Pilot card to get these people here, I can fly myself on my turn and you can use two turns to get there.
1 : So
1 : I can move myself.
2 : Ok so I'll just flip
3 : So just shore
3 : Just shore things, yeah.
2 : One, two, and three.
3 : Yeah
3 : And then finish your turn.
2 : (--) one, two
2 : Um

3 : Alright now my turn is- I'm just
1 : (--)
1 : your turn.
3 : Wait I'll shore this
2 : Shore this and fly off
3 : and then I'll go there
1 : Oh you know what? We have to use this to fly us all off of the Fool's Landing. So we have- We need two of them
3 : Yeah that's what I'm say-
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh- Off of the landing
2 : So we, we need another one is what we're saying
1 : So we're just gonna have to trust our luck.
2 : We're gonna hope
3 : Um
4 : So yeah, it's up to luck now.
1 : Hopefully you draw one
2 : Yeah
3 : Um I'm gonna use
3 : my sandbag
3 : that's not gonna help
2 : Oh shit, we should've- Or stuff- We should've used sandbags, we're not even thinking about them.
4 : We should've used the sandbags as they were sinking.
1 : Oh well, just
1 : draw your treasures and stuff.
2 : That doesn't matter, none of these are helpful.
3 : You can play it at anytime.
2 : Yeah but it doesn't help anymore. We should've done that earlier. Yeah
4 : No it's, it's gone.
3 : That's true, you're right, you're right. Ok um mm do I just keep going?
1 : Just draw your treasures, hopefully we'll get one.
2 : Yeah, yeah just go.
3 : Ok um

2 : And
4 : Can you pass, is that- I guess that
2 : Coral Palace
4 : that must
3 : I don't
2 : Coral Palace is here.
3 : Ok
3 : Bye

2 : And then you just
2 : Skip your turn, but you still need to draw these two.
1 : Well he has to do- Use a sandbag.
3 : Yeah
4 : Well I, I, I'll shore them up.
2 : Or
3 : What do you have to do? Oh yeah, ok

4 : Well I, I'll shore them up.
3 : Yeah
3 : It doesn't matter. Yeah it's just really
2 : No, it doesn't matter, we don't need them at this point.
4 : Doesn't matter.
2 : Water Rises
4 : Mmkay
2 : Shuffle these
4 : Yeah I'm obviously
4 : missing some nuance of this sinking rule here.
2 : It's ok- And then give me that.
3 : It, it's just that we have a minute and two seconds left.
1 : K
2 : Yeah we're gonna- Alright
4 : Or some crucial aspect of it which makes me misunderstand
1 : Did you go yet? Did he get his floods yet?
2 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, so that's done. He
2 : Um did you get your floods? No, no, no, you didn't get your floods.
2 : Alright so
1 : Ok Bronze Gate, Temple of the Moon, Observatory
2 : This one
4 : What's the rush?
2 : The Lighthouse is gone
3 : Observatory- Ok
2 : And this flipped, now it's your turn.
1 : K one, two
2 : One, two
2 : And then use that card. Yes
4 : Mmkay
2 : Thirty nine seconds
3 : I'm sweating a little bit
4 : Great, great, good job
2 : Ok

3 : Right
1 : Ok
1 : So I'm going to move
1 : and
1 : I can shore up two cause I'm the Engineer.
1 : Right?
3 : Yes
1 : Ok
1 : And then
3 : So do you have one more action left?
1 : Yeah but would anything be useful?
3 : Um
1 : At the moment-
3 : You could shore up that one, the one you're on.
1 : Ok
1 : Did I move?
1 : move yourself one space in a horizontal or vertical direction.
1 : Adjacent
1 : (--)
3 : Oh so you shored up
3 : this one
1 : Oh, oh, oh, my bad. My bad.
1 : Ok
1 : So I can shore up this one?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : I already shored up this one. Ok.
2 : I see
1 : Got it
3 : and then you can shore up that one since that would be your third action.
1 : Oh I can do three sh-.
1 : Oh cause that's two ok ok ok gotcha.
3 : Yeah
2 : You get up to three actions right?
3 : (There- yeah)
2 : Ok
1 : And then draw two
1 : Treasure cards.
2 : And get
2 : Two of the Treasure?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Thank you. A water's rise. A solid start
1 : Sorry guys
2 : Ok
1 : So discard
1 : and
3 : That goes over here yeah.
1 : Here
3 : And then we shuffle the-
1 : Sh- these.
1 : Put them on top
3 : And then we draw the cards.
1 : These two.
2 : Oh the Flood cards. We got two
3 : Mmhmm
1 : It's still two.
1 : Breaker's Bridge and the Gold Gate.
2 : (--)
1 : Gold gate
1 : Gold gate
3 : Um
1 : Got it
1 : No!
2 : That's gone.
1 : Didn't even get to know it well.
1 : Ok and put this in here.
2 : And that one's back here ok.
1 : Your turn?
2 : Am I up?
2 : So now what do I wanna do here?
1 : Oh boy.
2 : So I can take up to three actions.
1 : Ok so you can't shore up any.
1 : Right?
1 : Because you're not
2 : I can give Treasure cards.
2 : I can pass one of these your way. That'd be one.
1 : That's really nice of you.
2 : Doesn't matter who collects them does it?
1 : Uh uh
2 : Ok
3 : Oh you could,
2 : And I think I'm gonna move two maybe to
3 : you could move there and then um
1 : shore, oh
3 : shore up that one.
2 : Mmhmm three good. Ok
3 : Or did that, is that too many
3 : That's one oh yeah
2 : No that's two
1 : the one two three.
3 : Three yeah
2 : And then this would be the third right.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : eh
2 : So I've done that, now I need to draw two Treasure deck cards. That's these.
1 : (is this)
2 : Ok that wasn't bad.
2 : And now draw Flood cards equal to the Flood level which is two.
2 : Whispering Garden and Lost Lagoon.
2 : Lost Lagoon is lost.
2 : So that's gone, wait over there.
2 : And this one goes back here.
3 : Mmhmm.
1 : Yeah
2 : Is there anything else I need to do? Do we have to shuffle those (--)?
1 : Oh do we shu- no we didn't flood (--), no yeah ok.
3 : No
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
3 : Well it's my turn.
2 : Is it
2 : On to you now?
3 : Yeah ok
3 : Um ok so what I am
3 : D-d-doo
1 : What's your power again?
3 : (--)
3 : I can move anywhere so I'm going to move here and then
1 : Ok
1 : Sure.
3 : Shore up that one
3 : and
3 : I don't think I'm going to do anything else
3 : since this card isn't really all useful if we lose it.
1 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : And I take
1 : Two
2 : Two
3 : Two
3 : Two Treasures and a Helicopter.
3 : Ok
3 : And then I got two of those right.
2 : You need two Flood cards.
3 : Ok
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : (let it go, yeah)
1 : (there you go)
3 : And Phantom Rock
1 : There it goes.
3 : Now
3 : Ok
2 : And then it goes back over here.
3 : Ok
1 : My turn
1 : Ok so
1 : I can shore up to start right?
1 : I don't have to move first.
3 : Hmm we could
1 : I guess
1 : Moving's not
3 : We could move
3 : closer so you could get one the
1 : Ooo good call. I've
1 : Two of either, so
1 : Here
1 : And
2 : What if you move here and then you have the opportunity for either one.
3 : Oh yeah that's a good idea.
1 : Make two moves
3 : Yeah that would be your third, third action yeah.
2 : That would be your third, right? Unless there was something better. But
1 : Third yeah.
1 : No I don't think so.
1 : Ok
1 : And then done.
1 : And then
2 : You get two of those.
1 : Two of these.
1 : Oh
3 : Oops
1 : My bad
2 : There we go
1 : Ok
1 : Cool
1 : So now I six. I have to discard.
1 : One
2 : (is this a copter)
1 : And
1 : Draw the Flood cards.
1 : Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon
2 : Iron gate
3 : Oh here it is ok.
1 : Cool
2 : Is that it?
1 : Think so
2 : Alright what am I doing here.
2 : We don't have anything we need to Sandbag do we so I'm thinking of moving toward the
2 : the treasure. Does that make good sense? So I can do three.
1 : Yeah that makes sense.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So one, two. Do I wanna? (--)
3 : You couldn't shore it up.
3 : Uh
1 : From there.
2 : And then I could shore it up.
2 : Once it gets hot
2 : Ok so I've done that. Now two Treasure cards.
2 : Water's Rise, sorry.
3 : And that goes over here.
2 : That goes there and I need to shuffle the Flood Deck.
1 : yeah
2 : and put
2 : Put it on top of the
2 : pile
2 : Am I done here?
3 : And then (--) and just draw the cards.
2 : Draw the cards, I need to draw three now.
1 : right
2 : Ok so Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Thank you.
2 : Iron Gate is gone.
2 : Breaker's Bridge is here.
2 : Ok and these go here.
3 : Ok
1 : Yup
2 : Alright
3 : So I'm, I'm blue
3 : I'm gonna fly
3 : to
3 : your spot and then my other action's going to be to give you
1 : Oh thank you.
3 : this card here.
1 : So then do a discard right now?
3 : Yes.
1 : Ok
3 : yeah
1 : Discard
1 : (over) there
2 : goes over here.
3 : yeah
3 : And then I'm going to um
3 : Shore up this one.
3 : And now we draw cards here.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Another Sandbag
3 : one. And then I get (--) three.
3 : and that
1 : (--)
1 : Er
1 : yeah.
3 : K
3 : And
3 : Howling Garden
2 : It's here.
3 : Temple of the Moon
3 : and
3 : And Whispering Garden, so we should rescue one of those,
1 : Yeah
3 : probably.
3 : Um
3 : ok
1 : Um does o- one of these hold priority over
3 : Should we, should we s-
3 : probably this one, just because this one's like kinda far away from us.
1 : Ok
3 : So I can Sandbag
3 : That
1 : (--)
3 : one
3 : and do that.
1 : So San, Sandbags don't count?
1 : As a- ok cool.
3 : And no it's you can use it any time.
1 : My turn?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
1 : red
1 : Hm
1 : Do I want to head up?
3 : Oh you have
1 : here?
3 : Uh
2 : And I've got the
3 : You're, you're blue.
1 : Oh wait but I have
3 : Or so you're red, so you want to move here and then capture the, yeah
1 : red
2 : eh
2 : Yeah I think you do, you want to take the treasure.
1 : here and then capture.
3 : eh
3 : and then
1 : Ok
1 : So to capture treasure
1 : discard four.
1 : and then
1 : Ok
3 : And that's their second action.
1 : can I just
2 : So you get to hang on to that. Ok.
1 : take it
3 : Yeah
1 : mine, ok.
3 : Um
1 : Um so is that
1 : one action?
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : And (--) you have one more but I don't know if you can anything else. I guess you can
2 : It's good idea for me Sandbag the ah Temple of the Moon up there or one of these other ones.
1 : Sure
2 : Just uh so it doesn't go anywhere if you pick a, a card.
1 : pro-
1 : Probably.
3 : Hm
3 : Yeah
3 : I guess so
2 : What do you think does that seem reasonable since it's got a treasure and it can throw
3 : ah
1 : Yeah
2 : that there
3 : Ok
2 : I don't know if there's any reason to save it. Yeah.
1 : And then
3 : Oh you have to do the Water's Rising right or the
1 : Yeah
3 : Flood Cards
2 : so we got three
1 : Um Cave of Embers
2 : That's over there, and we don't even care about that anymore do we?
3 : No
1 : Copper Gate Crimson Forest
2 : Those are up that way.
3 : alright
1 : (Crimson Forest)
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Are we all done?
2 : Alright now what?
1 : No it's your turn?
2 : Yes
1 : Ok
2 : I'm not sure what action I want to take here really
3 : Um
2 : Um
2 : Do I have to be right on the um
3 : you
3 : You need to be on the tile
2 : On the tile to capture it, do we want tgo go up there and get ready?
3 : Yeah but next round, yeah next round I can give you
1 : (--)
3 : Or you could move or I could move.
3 : Oh
2 : Oh you didn't take Treasure. How many do you get two?
1 : Sorry
3 : Thanks
1 : yeah
3 : Ok
3 : oops
2 : Ok
1 : ah
2 : So
3 : So
3 : So I could give you
2 : You could give me that I'll have three and then I've got that
3 : That one and then
1 : Ok
3 : you could give, you could give me that
2 : I could eh, I could do that as one of my um-
3 : the
1 : move yeah
2 : actions. Why don't I start with that cause I
3 : Yeah
2 : I can do that, I'll move here. That's two.
3 : And then you can move closer.
2 : Maybe
3 : And then I guess you could
3 : Shore up that one.
2 : Shore that one up? That's a good thought.
2 : Ok so I've done three actionsn now I draw two cards right.
2 : Ugh and it's a Water's Rise
3 : the Water's rise
2 : So I've got to shuffle the deck.
1 : I'll slide up.
2 : Move it up one
2 : Discard this card to that.
2 : I got that. We don't care about this card.
2 : Draw Flood cards equal to the water level. Is that where were at
1 : Three still
2 : one, two, three.
2 : Alright so Crimson Forest is going back down.
2 : Howling Garden? Uh oh we're in trouble that's gone.
3 : oh
2 : And Whispering Garden

1 : Oh no.
2 : No ok let's pay attention to that one, save the Garden.

3 : And now I um do the
2 : You need the flood cards, what do you need three?
3 : Three
3 : Ok
3 : Ah Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Um
3 : and
3 : Cave of Embers
3 : Oh
3 : Good bye
2 : it doesn't matter though
3 : And then
3 : Copper Gate.
3 : Oh Copper Gate's gone. That's not good.
2 : Ah it's gone.
2 : Ok
3 : (go)
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : (ok yeah)
1 : Gonna give you this.
3 : And now
2 : Thank you
3 : Oh you have to be in the same
1 : Ah
2 : Oh you have to be on the
3 : tile though.
3 : I could fly you there
2 : Do, do that.
1 : Would you mind?
3 : I could fly you there.
1 : Thanks, uh right there.
3 : you're
3 : eh yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, so now I can give you this and did that count as one of my
2 : And now I got it thank you
3 : No cause I that's just uh
1 : moves? That's just ok
2 : That's you doing that
1 : So then there's counts as one and then should I
2 : But giving me the card counts as one
3 : Um
3 : Yeah
2 : Is there anything we need? We-
1 : Do we care about
1 : Either of these particularly more than
3 : I guess you can move here and then shore up that one since that's part of the main island
1 : can shore up.
1 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : two treasure cards please?
2 : Ok
1 : Oh
2 : Oh that's nice.
1 : Ok
1 : And then
3 : three
1 : three of these
1 : Silver Gate
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Oh no
2 : Uh oh
1 : Silver Gate
1 : And Breaker's Bridge. Ah
2 : Breaker's Bridge is gone then?
1 : gone.
1 : (Is that these two)
2 : Silver Gate
2 : ah
2 : Ok
3 : Hmm
1 : Ok
3 : Is that it?
3 : Oh so it's your turn now.
3 : So you can, you can capture.
2 : Can I capture it while it's flooded?
3 : (yeah)
3 : Yeah it's not uh
2 : I can?
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : So that's
1 : Yay!
2 : Definitely what I'm doing there so those go in the treasure pile.
3 : no
3 : yeah I think so
2 : Alright so that's one action.
3 : You-
3 : You could move and then shore up that one or you could- yeah I guess
3 : since you already have it it doesn't matter.
2 : Is there anything else I want or need to do here?
3 : Uh
3 : No
3 : I don't think so.
1 : Yeah cause we don't need that card.
3 : yeah
2 : Or do I want to move off the, the flooded one, just in case? I don't think I want to be swimming.
3 : Yeah, I think, I think moving would be a good idea.
1 : Swimming
1 : Ah
2 : So we've got that, that's one.
2 : Is there a reason not move one more closer to the middle of things?
3 : two
3 : No since we have two
3 : two um treasures, yeah.
2 : Maybe this gives me more options if I go here and then
1 : Ok
2 : Then I can move to either of those.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So have I drawn two fl- now I've lost track of where I was. Draw two Treasure Deck cards then. Ok.
1 : I know.
2 : Got two and then draw Flood cards. So I have one, two
2 : Three, ok Dunes of Deception
2 : Coral Palace
2 : And the Bronze Gate.
2 : Ok
2 : Think we're good. And it's on to you.
3 : Mmhmm.
3 : Ok
3 : Mm
3 : Alrighty
3 : I
3 : Um
1 : Which
1 : Let's see, we need these two
1 : Oh you're on your way to that.
3 : I'm gonna
3 : I'm gonna move here and
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Shore up this one.
1 : Nice.
3 : And then
3 : Um
3 : I don't think you can do anything else
3 : huh
3 : Mm
3 : (We already have that one, discard that one.)
3 : Ok and then three of those cards.
1 : And three of these.
3 : Ok it's Tidal Palace
3 : One right there, it's right in front of me.
3 : Ah Temple of the Sun
2 : Ah down here.
3 : Right over there.
3 : and then Misty Marsh
3 : ok
2 : Ok
1 : Ok um
1 : So
1 : should I
1 : shore this, move one
1 : capture treasure
3 : Mm
3 : No I wouldn't
3 : This, probably this move.
2 : Is there anything up that way we need. I don't think so cause we already get this treasure, right?
3 : NnMm no, I would probably just move here
1 : And move it
1 : to
3 : And then your third would be the capture and then we'd have all of our treasures.
1 : the capture
2 : So we've got three.
1 : So we just need to get to Fool's Landing?
3 : yeah
1 : And then can I have two treasure?
3 : Oh Water's Rise.
1 : (uh ok)
1 : Oh
2 : That goes over here.
1 : Uh
1 : And j-
3 : Um
2 : Yeah you have to shuffle them. Put them on top of the Flood draw pile.
3 : ah yeah
3 : Then you could
3 : Um well after you do that, you could, you could use your thing to move these two here.
3 : And then you can
1 : Whoa!
1 : Whoa!
1 : Both of them?
1 : move?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok.
1 : And then discard.
2 : I have to discard that.
1 : And then
2 : And now
2 : It's me
1 : Yeah
2 : You know what, I think do you is there any reason to
3 : Oh no you have to do the um the Flood, the um the-the three.
1 : Ah! I have to draw the Flood cards still.
2 : Oh
2 : Oh I forgot.
1 : Ok Coral Palace, Dunes of
1 : Deception.
2 : That's going that way.
1 : And the Silver Gate.
3 : (not much of a-) no Silver Gate's gone.
2 : Silver Gate ok, right there
2 : Ok and that one goes back here.
1 : oh
3 : Alright and now, now it's your turn
2 : So now it's up to me. So we don't, we don't need any other treasures?
3 : No
2 : So
1 : Do we have to get you to Fool's Landing?
3 : I just need to get to Fool's Landing and then
2 : and then we're off so.
1 : And then we're free.
3 : I'll use, I'll use this. So I just
2 : So do I need to do anything or um
3 : Um
3 : No I don't
1 : Is there anything you need to shore?
2 : Is there any action I should do?
3 : Oh we should shore up
3 : this one.
2 : Ca- I could shore that up.
1 : Just, just cause
3 : Cause of, yeah.
2 : Makes me feel better. Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright and then take two cards.
2 : I don't think we care about any of these right?
3 : Yeah, and then just the

3 : And this
2 : You might have to
1 : No (--)
2 : get rid of something.
3 : I have five now
3 : cause Pilot doesn't count.
2 : So if you
3 : And now I draw two- three flood cards
1 : Does the Helicopter Lift cards count towards your total or not?
1 : I thought special cards
3 : Yeah
3 : I think these count towards
2 : I think you have six now, so what do you do?
1 : No, no, no that- They were- That doesn't
3 : Pilot doesn't count
4 : Oh
1 : But do the special cards count?
2 : Oh
4 : Oh you can have five. You may only have five cards in your hand it's when you have six, you have to get rid of one.
1 : I don't know
2 : Does this one count?

4 : Nnhmm
2 : Oh

4 : Well I'm just gonna start heading this way so I can give you this lion guy, so I'll go one, two
2 : (--) the lion guy
4 : three.
2 : Nice
4 : And then could I have two treasure cards?
2 : Uh
4 : um
4 : I got that guy and Water's Rise
4 : so
4 : there's that. And then could you shuffle those for me or hand them to me or
2 : Mmhmm
2 : You're ok with me just shuffling them, however I'm not very good at this.
4 : Yup
4 : I'm trusting you, and then
2 : And I just put em back on top.
4 : Yeah and then I still have to get three right?
2 : And you need
2 : three
2 : There you go
4 : Awesome thanks
2 : There you go
4 : K Iron Gate
2 : Well that's gone.
4 : Oh that's gone.
4 : My bad
4 : Temple of the Moon
2 : It's all good
1 : No, no that goes over here
4 : Crimson Forest
2 : Oh oh
4 : Oh I'm messing stuff up
1 : Yeah
1 : the blue Temple of the Moon.
4 : Glad you caught it.
4 : Um wait which one do I need? Iron Gate, no. Temple of the Moon. Is that right? Yeah
1 : The Moon
2 : Yeah
4 : And then Crimson Forest, so
2 : So that's gone.
4 : Oh (--) sorry
4 : Um and then could you put that over there?
1 : Oh man
2 : So we gotta be careful with
2 : these.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah we should probably start shoring up.
4 : Yeah
2 : Probably
4 : Start shoring some stuff.
1 : Um
2 : Shoring up
4 : Alright
1 : So
2 : K
1 : you're gonna give her your card next time and she's gonna move down there.
4 : Yup I'm gonna give her that lion
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Um
4 : This
1 : Then you can move anywhere
2 : Someone's gotta shore up this, this jazz
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
1 : I mean I can get
1 : to here
1 : I can do- I can get to there,
1 : do both of them.
2 : Shore up both
4 : I'm gonna do that
1 : Um but I wanna
1 : Oh wait
1 : But I also wanna give you
1 : this or something else, I don't know.
1 : I'm just at five cards
4 : Mm
4 : well
4 : if mm, I was gonna say if you head that way
3 : I can use the Helicopter Lift to save you the moving
2 : You probably
1 : If we all need one of those
2 : You can fly both of you
1 : Oh that's true. But he can move anywhere anytime.
2 : So like each of you could shore up one.
4 : But he can shore up two.
2 : Yeah
4 : Um
4 : I mean if you're gonna be over here I can give you one of these maybe and then you could get that guy.
1 : So
1 : I would just have an odd collection of things right? We've got
1 : five here
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Uh and
4 : Mmhmm
1 : and
1 : five there,
1 : or four.
2 : (--)
4 : Four, yeah
1 : If I get- We could
1 : But we can get this almost near immediately if I give
1 : How many cards are you able to give
1 : per action? One
2 : Well
4 : One
1 : Right
2 : Uh
1 : Give a treasure card. I can give one treasure card.
1 : (--)
1 : one.
2 : It says you can give away one action per card so you can give away three,
2 : if you're on the same card.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
2 : I mean you could give
2 : Oh wait I don't have the thing, duh.
2 : I mean you can give her
1 : Does anyone have a
2 : one of them?
1 : a preference?
2 : No
4 : For
4 : I don't even- A preference for what? I don't even know what we're talking about.
1 : So I can move here and do those or I can try to give you or
4 : Mmhmm
1 : stay near you so I can get some cards.
2 : I think this makes more sense to move there because otherwise if we lose
4 : Yeah I think you should just do that.
4 : Yeah cause these guys, just carry that
2 : both of these or one of them, it's just gonna be- it's just gonna suck.
1 : Ok
1 : Do it
1 : Ok
1 : The Messenger can give anyone a card anytime
4 : Yeah I'm good with that.
2 : What do you think Pilot?
1 : Right or
4 : Mm
2 : Uh is that my thing?
2 : Give a treasure card to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card
1 : Yeah
4 : Right so that's during her turn.
2 : So I still
1 : Well you two are close you can start passing things so it's a (little deal)
4 : No, it's fine.
1 : That's three actions
4 : Cool, thanks (--)
2 : Cool
1 : Ok
4 : Does that count as three or have you flipped two, is it still one?
1 : That's one action
2 : It's still
2 : three yeah, unfortunately.
1 : Yeah
4 : Oh ok
1 : Um ok
1 : and
1 : what's the next step? Two treasure cards right?
2 : Yeah
1 : So I'm gonna have to discard some cards here
2 : Yeah you're gonna have to do something with that.
1 : Um
1 : Did-
1 : For some reason I thought these do not count.
1 : It does not
1 : That was action card
4 : It doesn't count as an action
1 : But you still only can have five right?
3 : Mm
2 : Yeah you're at six
2 : no you're at seven.
4 : seven.
2 : You're over achieving like a bandit
1 : Yeah (--)
4 : So I have to get rid of two
1 : I need to get rid of two
1 : Um
2 : Do you literally like discard them then?
1 : Yeah (--) just
1 : go away
1 : Uh I'm inclined to hang on to this cause there's three of em
4 : Mm
4 : Yeah I was gonna say
3 : Mmhmm
2 : You don't need to have three of them though
1 : Um
4 : Well if he gets one more he'll be able to grab one
1 : He can
1 : So she can give you
2 : Yeah that's true
1 : a card
1 : and he can give me a card.
1 : I can have four
1 : of these
4 : Yeah
1 : at some point, I don't know, I'm really close.
2 : It's up to you
4 : You're so close
1 : So we could get
1 : At least the chalice sometime soon, if I, if I chill or hang out near there.
2 : So what do you think
4 : Yeah
4 : I don't know dude, if I were you I'd get rid of these two because this guys seems kinda irrelevant. You know we're not really messing with that little fire stone guy yet.
3 : Mm
1 : Alright
1 : I'm done
2 : And uh this go here
1 : Alright
3 : Did you move the blue pawn?
1 : Yes
2 : He did, yeah
3 : Ok you're red
1 : Oh
2 : Oh dear
4 : Easy fix
1 : Hopefully
3 : Yeah, easy fix, it's fine.
1 : Let's get
1 : Um
1 : I know what color I am.
1 : Red
2 : Nice
1 : Uh
1 : Alright now I need to draw three
2 : Nice
1 : Mm
1 : Ok uh
1 : Sun
2 : This one
1 : This (--)
1 : Tidal Temple, alright well I'm right here so that's a good thing.
4 : Yeah that's actually really convenient.
1 : And Breaker Bridge
2 : Thank goodness.
4 : Awesome.
2 : You know it could've been bad.
4 : Good thing you shored em up or they'd be gone.
2 : Cool
2 : Ok
2 : So I'm this dude
4 : Right
4 : I wish you could move to me to get it
4 : and then
2 : Yeah
1 : But
4 : But it'll- You won't have enough turns so you'll just be standing there
1 : Well I think you have to give on your turn
1 : Give, give a treasure card as a a- action.
4 : Do we
4 : Oh maybe you're right.
2 : Yeah it'll be better because then I can move like here
1 : And you can move diagonally still
4 : Mmhmm
2 : And then I'll just chill and you can just go diagonally.
4 : Yeah, that's cool.
2 : Ok so I'll just go
2 : here, sorry I'm not helping with the shoring up stuff guys.
2 : I wish I could but you know
4 : My bad
2 : So I
2 : I think that's it
4 : Mm yeah
2 : for me.
4 : Unless you wanna give a card to anybody but I don't think
2 : I don't really have anything to give- You guys can't take it anyway unfortunately.
4 : Yeah
4 : but
4 : Mmhmm
2 : You only got one little flaming rock
4 : The flaming rock
2 : Two of these
2 : Oh I got two flaming rocks
1 : Awesome
4 : Oh
2 : Ah jackpot
2 : Jackpot of flaming rocks
3 : But now you have six
4 : Now you got six
2 : Now I have six
4 : Back donw to two
2 : I'm gonna cry myself to sleep. I guess I'm gonna get rid of the flaming rock- Wait, how many flaming rocks are already gone?
3 : Mm
1 : There are two-
1 : Oh I meant
1 : Yeah
2 : Uh
2 : well
1 : Yeah but there's
2 : Boogers
1 : It
1 : He has one and she has one of the Golden
4 : Yeah
2 : But then they'd both have to give it to me
1 : That's ok, that's
2 : That sounds really weird
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok I guess he can move two and then give me his thing but I'm nervous about all the little islands going bye bye
1 : Yup
4 : Mm
4 : I mean
4 : you're gonna have, have
2 : I gotta get rid of
4 : pretty much have to get rid of a flame rock cause you're already sitting with the other dude.
2 : um
2 : Well
2 : we gotta use the flame rock at some point.
4 : Yeah
2 : And there's two lions and then we can get rid of the flaming rock.
2 : What's everybody else think?
1 : I would say get rid of the rock
4 : I mean
3 : Um
4 : I would say get rick of the rock casue you're already there, yeah
2 : Get rid of the flaming rock
3 : I would say get rid of the- Yeah
2 : Get rid of the flaming rock
3 : Plus we have two flaming rocks left and only one lion
1 : Yeah
1 : then
1 : yeah if we lose that lion we- Well we don't lose right away but we will, soon
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok, let's uh, let's get rid of the flaming rock
4 : Alright good job guys
2 : We got rid of the flaming rock. Uh ok so then we do
3 : Now you draw flood cards
2 : this thing. Ok three still?
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Oh thank god
1 : (--)
2 : Ok
2 : Dunes of Deception
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok we're still doing ok
2 : Silver Gate
1 : It's up here
2 : Ok
2 : and Copper Gate.
4 : Oh
2 : Which is oh
4 : that's gone.
2 : did it have anything on it?
1 : No
4 : Nnhmm
2 : Cool, thanks
3 : Ok
2 : Mm good
3 : good turn.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : So I'm gonna move to you and give you this.
1 : I, I
4 : Oh
3 : That seem logical?
1 : Are we (able to) play these cards outside of our turns?
2 : Um
3 : It says you can play it anytime.
1 : Yeah
2 : I mean you can if you want to
3 : so
4 : I mean un- unless you wanna
4 : shore things up since there's a bunch because I'm right there so then I can just move after your turn cause she's not gonna be able to use it until her turn
3 : Mm
2 : That's true
3 : That's true, I'll just shore things up cause all these are flooded.
2 : Like whatever
4 : Yeah I would think that'd be the better idea.
2 : I would, I would
3 : So
2 : Mm like
2 : yeah
3 : move
3 : here,
2 : Definitely turn over that temple
3 : shore up one, so that's two moves, I can shore up one more.
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
1 : I'd do the one you're on yeah
3 : Mm shore
3 : Breaker's Bridge
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : and
4 : and then that's good cause I can shore up that one.
2 : And then you're gonna move
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Now I draw treasure cards but I am gonna have to discard some things.
2 : We're great
3 : We don't really need that.
2 : Nope
3 : and
2 : Mm
2 : There's already four of those rocks out there
3 : Do I really need two Helicopter Lifts?
1 : Probably not
3 : Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
2 : (--)
1 : I've got one too.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
3 : and we need to keep one to win the game.
2 : So we need one to leave
1 : Yes
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : So we don't just fly off the island?
1 : No
3 : No we need this card
4 : Nnhmm
2 : Ok we need the thing
1 : Gotta go back to the Fool's Landing
4 : Yeah, we have to have the means to do so
3 : Ok now I need two- three flood cards please.
2 : Ooo
3 : And hopefully things don't get too
3 : messy.
3 : Cave of Shadows
4 : Mm
4 : So that's our flame rock
3 : Cave of Embers
1 : Alright
4 : Double flame rock
2 : Oh god
3 : Bronze Gate
4 : Bronze Gate
1 : Eh well
4 : Huh, that wasn't too bad
2 : Ok
1 : Oh, I'm ok letting the Bronze Gate die
4 : Ok so I guess I'm just gonna shore this up and then I'll come over there to you.
2 : Nice
2 : Yeah
3 : That's one
4 : One and then two and then I'll give you this card
2 : Ok
3 : And that's (--)
3 : Nice
2 : so
4 : And then I guess you gotta get rid of your other
4 : flame rock.
1 : No I think you need
1 : five
3 : Yeah you only need four
4 : Four
4 : But I think you have to wait till your turn to
2 : But
1 : No, no that's- Yeah, yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok so I got that
4 : and then
2 : I'm gonna
3 : So hopefully Howling Garden doesn't sink in that time.
4 : I'm just gonna get rid of that right away.
1 : But you have six though, so do you have to get rid of all the rocks?
4 : Yeah, I think you do have to get rid of one rock
1 : Yes
3 : Mmhmm
2 : What- Then the rock has to go. We're getting rid of a lot of rocks.
4 : Um
4 : could I have three flood cards?
1 : We only, we only
2 : I guess- Oh we only need three of the treasures, so I guess, forget the rock
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
4 : That's true we could just forget the rock, I didn't even think about that.
4 : Alright, Watchtower
4 : and then Misty Marsh and Howling Garden, uh
2 : Woo hoo
4 : Oh cool, perfect, perfect timing.
4 : Yeah
2 : Not if both (--)
4 : Oh that's true
1 : Um
2 : Uh, no it'd be fine
4 : We(--) swimming
2 : Eh
3 : Ok
1 : So
1 : this is
1 : hmm
1 : Well this is one turn for me if I flip both of those
4 : Um
3 : It's one- yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : And that would be two
2 : Cool
1 : Then I could flip both of these again
4 : Awesome
1 : for three.
2 : Oh dude that's great
4 : That was a power move dude. That was really
1 : Um
2 : Dude
3 : Good turn
2 : That was great, good job
2 : Engineer
4 : Killing it
2 : Ok clutch.
3 : So now you need your treasure cards
4 : Try not to sink us
1 : Yeah
2 : Ah
1 : Well
1 : um
3 : The water just rose
2 : I think- Did you get every single one of those?
1 : Oh you have to play that immediate
1 : Probably
1 : Uh I have to play that immediately, but I also have to discard a card.
4 : Um what have you
1 : Right?
4 : get rid of one of those uh
3 : Yeah you should probably get rid of one of those
2 : You can get rid of the
4 : I was gonna say get rid of the- one of the chalices, cause I've got em and I'm right by it
3 : chalices
2 : Get rid of
1 : Oh ok
3 : Yeah
2 : So it'll be fine.
1 : Um and you moved it up for me right? Yeah
3 : Three flood cards
2 : I did
1 : Oh you did- Oh no- (you need to) shuffle
2 : Oh yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Right
1 : Yup
2 : Good call, good call I completely forgot about that. Please don't do Howling Garden.
4 : (--)
3 : No
4 : Right, then we'd lose. Man
2 : Please don't do that.
2 : You got this though
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : Mm
2 : I'm so nervous
1 : I know I don't want to stop shuffling.
4 : I know like I'm crossing my fingers too.
1 : Alright
2 : You got this
1 : I need three
2 : Ok
2 : here we go.
1 : Alright
4 : Oh it's pretty good ok
2 : Ok, ok, ok
1 : Uh Sun
3 : mm
1 : and the Palace again. Apparently they're best buddies.
3 : I got it
4 : Then this one
2 : None of those places wanna go
1 : And then the
4 : And then
1 : Bridge, where's that?
1 : Ok cool
4 : Wow we're doing pretty good.
2 : Great, that was great.
3 : Alright so now we can capitalize on
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah get that lion
3 : this little
2 : Lion
4 : Feel's good.
2 : I guess I just put this here
4 : I can imagine that's what you do.
3 : Yeah
1 : What are- What are we supposed to do with
2 : Um what are we supposed to do with the lion?
4 : I think it's just our now.
3 : I guess we just hold onto it, yeah
2 : Can we- Can we put it on the island? Can we
4 : Alright
3 : It's all yours.
2 : Can it chill there?
1 : I- uh I don't know
3 : Yeah it's not hurting anyone.
4 : Yeah we could do that
2 : Oh it's cute
1 : I mean- yeah
2 : yeah
2 : Let it
2 : It's adorable.
4 : Let it stay
1 : What does it say we're supposed to do when we capture it?
2 : I captured it
2 : That's a good question there's a booklet
1 : You're supposed to put it somewhere?
4 : I think it just takes the
3 : I'm not too worried about it.
4 : action and
4 : I feel like that's the one instruction we didn't receive.
2 : Mm shoot
4 : Um
4 : uh I mean doesn't it kind of not matter it's
2 : Ok
4 : just kind of an aesthetic choice.
2 : Ok, it- I guess it's not a biggie. Ok I have plenty of space.
1 : Yeah
4 : Awesome.
2 : Ok so that counts as one.
1 : Yup
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Um I should
2 : I'm the gray one, right?
1 : Do you need to give anyone anything? No
4 : Nnhmm
2 : Um
2 : Yeah I
2 : I don't have any
2 : You guys don't have any space
4 : Nnhmm
2 : Um so I'm gonna move
2 : here
2 : and I'll just
2 : I'm just gonna shore it up anyway, there's nothing else- there's no big difference anyway. I don't know
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
2 : And then draw two
2 : I got another flaming rock.
4 : Oh
2 : And a purple thing.
2 : Cool and then three of these
2 : So we have the Cave of Embers
4 : That's gone.
2 : Ok so we lost the flaming rock- Oop sorry
3 : Still one more.
2 : Um the Silver Gate
1 : Lost that
2 : And the Dunes of Deception, which is this guy.
4 : Thank you
2 : Yeah
2 : this island is really
2 : going quickly.
4 : Um
3 : ok
3 : My turn, I'm gonna fly
3 : over here
4 : Mmhmm
3 : That's one move, shore this up
2 : Nice
3 : Shore this up
2 : Great
3 : and now we draw cards.
3 : sandbags,
3 : and
3 : Mm I'm just gonna get rid of both the flaming rocks.
3 : Well actually
3 : yeah.
1 : So
3 : I'm just gonna
1 : You can use your special cards immediately, it says
3 : get rid of both
2 : That's a good plan.
1 : If you wanna use the sandbag instead of just getting rid of it
3 : Actually
3 : Yeah
2 : What's the sandbag?
3 : It
3 : shores up any tile on the island.
1 : (--)
1 : before you discard it.
2 : I don't know if the ones that are bad
3 : This one's totally useless
1 : Yeah, and that one's near useless too but if we wanna get here ever
2 : are- None of them are useful.
3 : Yeah so
4 : Yeah
2 : But that one's there
3 : use this
3 : shore this up.
1 : Might as well at least use it, instead of discarding it.
2 : I guess that's makes sense.
4 : Why not?
3 : And then I still have to discard one either way.
2 : And you get rid of them
4 : Ok
2 : Flaming rock
3 : And now I need three flood cards please
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ooo
3 : Watchtower
2 : Where's that?
3 : Mm
1 : I don't know.
3 : Right here.
2 : Mmkay
1 : It's the first time we've drawn that card.
3 : Uh Bronze Gate
2 : Mm
3 : that's dead.
3 : And the Cave of Shadows.
2 : K
4 : Mm
1 : I feel like this is gonna end real fast
3 : Well we've
2 : Oh well
2 : We only have ten minutes left
4 : Yeah (--)
4 : I know
2 : And we only have a
2 : lion with wings
3 : We're close to the chalice
4 : Um
4 : Yeah
4 : um that's what I was gonna say, is like
4 : I don't know
3 : Or maybe you should just chill there for a little bit
4 : Yeah
3 : and someone can give you that for your next turn.
2 : I'm on the
4 : I'm pretty sure I can shore these two up diagonally, I can just do that. I can move and do that.
2 : If you move there
2 : Oh there you go
4 : I mean
4 : and then somebody can try and come over here and give it to me or I can
1 : Wouldn't
1 : Ok
4 : Oh
1 : Do we wanna shore that one up?
3 : Yeah we should probably shore up Cave of Shadows instead.
4 : Yeah
4 : ok, you're right. Yeah just
2 : Let's get rid of that one yeah
3 : Yeah Dunes is
2 : That's a good idea.
4 : Yeah I didn't even notice that. Thanks guys
3 : Ok
2 : That's a good idea.
4 : Alright, perfect
1 : Alright
1 : so
3 : Two treasure cards
4 : Oh thank you
1 : Um
4 : Um ok
3 : Another chalice
3 : Perfect.
4 : Yeah
4 : Isn't that convenient?
2 : Oh yeah
4 : Um so I guess I'll just get rid of these guys
2 : Yeah
4 : and then too bad I can't use that right now
2 : Great
4 : but
2 : No, but that's great, cause you're on the thing
4 : when I can
3 : Yeah
3 : next turn.
4 : Alright, on to the next one.
2 : That's great
1 : Well
1 : I'm gonna use
3 : Now you need three flood cards.
1 : This doesn't count as an action, when I use this right?
2 : Does it say?
3 : No it doesn't.
4 : I don't think it does
1 : So I can just move anyone whenever I feel like it right?
2 : Does not count as an action
4 : Oh yeah
3 : Did you draw the flood card?
1 : Including myself.
4 : I didn't
2 : Yeah but there's no
3 : Explorer
1 : Oh
4 : I'm sorry
1 : wait
1 : let's
1 : wait until I do that.
2 : Oh
4 : Yeah here just take that back.
1 : Until she does
4 : Thank you
2 : Yeah good reminder.
4 : Um ok so this guy
4 : and Howling Garden
1 : I was gonna say that was a
2 : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
4 : Oh I'm sorry
2 : No it's ok.
3 : Howling Garden's
4 : And um
4 : Misty Marsh, so that's- Doesn't matter.
2 : Eh, that's fine.
3 : Ok
2 : Great
4 : Ok, now do your thing
3 : Alright Engineer
1 : So I'm gonna move over here
2 : You gonna do the same thing?
4 : Uh huh
3 : Well I'm, I'm blue.
1 : Oh wait no she already has four
2 : You don't need to. Yeah
1 : I don't need to anymore
4 : Oh yeah now I have it, ok.
2 : You can
3 : And don't forget I'm blue
3 : You're, you're red.
1 : Oh I don't know why I'm all about just moving blue.
4 : Yeah
2 : You really
1 : Maybe
1 : I think I'm blue, I don't know.
4 : Well you could
4 : give
4 : him
2 : Yeah go on the same
4 : that rock and then she can do it too
2 : thing
1 : Well I,
2 : and give him the card
1 : either way
1 : I'm gonna move that
1 : because
1 : that does not count as a (--)
1 : (--) right?
2 : You flew?
2 : No it doesn't count as an action.
1 : Ok
1 : (--)
2 : You gonna shore those up? You don't need to shore those up.
4 : Do we need to shore those up though? Cause they don't do- We won't ever go over there for anything.
1 : Oh
3 : Yeah we don't need those.
1 : Will I just waste my Helicopter Card then?
2 : So
1 : Oh
2 : I-
2 : Are you on the same tile as the Pilot?
4 : Well
2 : I would've just moved to the Pilot tile and given him the purple rock
3 : I'm the Pilot
4 : I was gonna say
4 : Yeah and then she has one too so then he
1 : Ok
1 : I didn't do that.
1 : Edit, undo
2 : Mm well
4 : Eh I think we can fairly undo it
2 : I'm gonna ignore it, whatever.
1 : Are we allowed to
1 : Alright I haven't done anything yet
2 : Ok so you can still
4 : Nothing has happened
3 : It's beginning of your turn.
2 : go.
1 : Um
1 : alright
4 : So I would just move and give him that
2 : I would give him the purple rock.
4 : rock and then
4 : she can give him purple rock too.
3 : And then I can discard this.
2 : Yeah, you don't need that.
1 : K that's one,
1 : that's two,
4 : Awesome and then you can give it to anyone at anytime.
4 : Perfect.
1 : and
1 : uh
2 : Yeah
1 : I'm just gonna move back
2 : You could just
2 : You don't have to move at all if you don't want to.
1 : Well I'd rather be more center to everything cause I can
2 : That's a good idea.
3 : Yeah
4 : I guess- Do we all have to get to this Fool's Landing to leave? So just hang out.
1 : un- undo things.
3 : Yeah we all have to go there.
2 : Yeah
1 : Um
2 : There you go.
1 : now I have to draw two of those.
2 : There you go.
1 : Oh my gosh I'm the worst at this game.
4 : Aw, I don't think you're bad.
2 : You have picked every one of those I think.
1 : Alright so
4 : Someone has to.
1 : Rises up
2 : Oh boy
2 : Well no one's on anything that's
1 : Shuffle
2 : If anything's goes under it's ok.
4 : Yeah
1 : Here let me do that.
4 : Yeah
3 : Just as long as Fool's Landing doesn't sink.
1 : I don't know if it matters who does it but
1 : thanks.
2 : That's a good shuffle.
3 : Yeah we have seven minutes.
1 : Alright yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Well actually we're pretty safe right now.
4 : Yeah I feel pretty good
1 : Cause
1 : I gotta draw four though. One
2 : Oh we're up to four now.
1 : two
4 : I feel like we're on our way.
1 : three
1 : four.
2 : Ok
1 : so
1 : uh Dunes are gone
2 : Cave of Shadows,
1 : Bridge flips,
1 : Shadow flips.
1 : Then Watchtower flips.
4 : Mm
2 : Ok
1 : And
2 : Great
3 : Now it's your turn.
2 : That's it.
4 : Cool.
2 : And I am
2 : right there.
4 : Yeah you should just give him that rock.
3 : Yeah you don't have to be
4 : You can just give it to him right?
2 : This
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm, the Messenger's special ability.
4 : Yeah that's your special thing.
1 : Hey you can do it
1 : at any time you want, that's your special power.
2 : Give treasure cards anywhere
2 : Yeah, here's a rock.
1 : Yeah
4 : Cool. Oh you're so ready.
1 : That's one action.
3 : I have to discard this.
2 : Yeah I guess we're not gonna get that.
2 : Um
2 : and then I'm just going to- Should I just like shore up
2 : the other two spaces or something? Like what should I do?
4 : Mm
4 : Yeah, whatever.
1 : Might as well.
3 : If we need to keep this up.
2 : We do
1 : Well next- In your turn and on her turn we're getting all of our
4 : Mm
4 : we only need
3 : Oh right- Yeah you're right.
4 : three, yeah.
1 : all of our things.
3 : We only need the
3 : Yeah
2 : We need at least one of these.
1 : Yeah just
4 : You can if you want to.
3 : Mm
1 : shore them both up.
2 : I guess there's no, there's no harm right?
4 : Nnhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Cause I guess these can all go and it's fine
4 : Is that three?
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : That is three, yeah, and so I get two of these
1 : Yeah that was three so
4 : Cool
2 : Uh
2 : got another stupid lion thing
1 : It doesn't matter- he has- he
1 : he has four and she has four,
4 : Yeah
1 : four
4 : And then (--) flood card
2 : And then
3 : And we just
2 : I- Oh
2 : Oh gosh so many of these.
2 : Four
4 : Oh yeah it's probably good that you did that.
2 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Thank goodness.
2 : Ok there's that.
2 : Tidal Palace
2 : Thank you. Howling Gardens.
3 : Dead
4 : See ya
2 : That's fine. Temple of the Moon.
1 : It's gone too.
2 : Also fine
3 : And that is dead.
1 : Because we're out this turn.
3 : So
3 : So I'm gonna go here, that's one move.
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Yup
3 : Cahs these in
2 : Nice
1 : That's two
1 : and then you can move wherever you want so
2 : You can shore it up.
4 : I was gonna say you can just move towards the
2 : Or you could shore it up so that way it doesn't
1 : Uh
3 : Mm you don't
1 : It doesn't matter though, we only need three treasures.
2 : get flipped under.
2 : Yeah but if it gets flipped over and he's on it, we lose.
1 : Well he could just move to the island
4 : I thought he was just swimming.
3 : I can swim here.
2 : Oh yeah
4 : Yeah so
3 : So
1 : You should just move to the Fool's Island. That's where he has to go.
4 : You should just move towards it.
3 : For the last- Yeah
2 : Well then do what-
2 : Can you move diagonally?
4 : Wait you can't move diagonally though.
3 : That was
1 : He's a Pilot though.
3 : I can fly anywhere.
4 : Oh you can do whatever you want. You're right.
2 : Ooo, I wanna do whatever I- That's awesome.
3 : So
3 : two
3 : I have another Lift and I have that.
4 : Cool
2 : Crushing it
3 : And four flood cards please.
2 : Mm
2 : Well, that's all of em.
3 : The last four.
3 : Fool's Landing, oh boy. That's not good.
3 : Can you flip that please?
2 : Sure
3 : I'm just gonna set these here.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Twilight Hollow
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Coral Palace
2 : Mm
2 : Oh my god
3 : Observatory.
4 : Oh
3 : (--) we have five minutes.
4 : I think it's amazing
2 : So everything
3 : Alright now all we have to do is get to Fool's Landing and
1 : Why is Watchtower not- Oh cause I'm almost- Oh you want to flip them that's why. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : we win.
4 : Ok
4 : Yeah she
2 : Mm
4 : K so I'm gonna go ahead and get that guy for us
3 : Cool
2 : Cool
4 : So there's that.
2 : Awesome
3 : Mm
4 : Awesome.
1 : And you can move diagonally.
4 : Yeah now I'm just gonna
3 : Go to Fool's Landing and chill out.
2 : I would shore up
1 : Yeah and flip
3 : And shore up,
4 : Uh yeah I'm gonna shore
3 : yeah shore up Fool's Landing.
1 : No
4 : Shore up this one and then
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah shore up Fool's Landing. Move there and shore it.
3 : And there's your three turns.
4 : Mm uh mm
4 : alright
4 : (--)
1 : Um
1 : Does
4 : And then I'm gonna move over here
2 : Woo
1 : Are there instructions on what to do when you don't have
2 : That's true
1 : I imagine you probably just shuffle them back in but I don't know.
4 : Yeah just, we can
4 : hold on to them, I guess.
3 : Well we were inst- We weren't instructed on that so, I'd say just ignore it
4 : Yeah so I guess that doesn't
3 : and move on.
4 : Um
1 : I like that strategy cause then we win.
3 : Yeah
2 : (--)
4 : Wait what are we worried about?
2 : Uh
3 : We're out of flood cards.
4 : Oh
4 : Weird
2 : If the flood pile runs out immediately shuffle it and stack the cards face down to form a new one.
3 : I see
1 : Yeah I figured that's what you would
4 : Ok
4 : Let's go ahead and do that I guess.
2 : Yeah
2 : Oh gosh we have three minutes.
1 : Draw two treasure cards
2 : Draw two- Ooo yeah
2 : You have to draw two treasure cards
4 : I do?
2 : Yeah
4 : I thought I did that, no?
1 : No
2 : No
4 : Ok
4 : Oh well the Water's Rising. Sorry guys
2 : Oh crud.
1 : But you can swim anywhere so it'll be alright.
4 : So we're fine, yeah
2 : That's true
4 : Um
4 : k, could I have four flood cards.
2 : Yeah
2 : Did we remove the tag
4 : Thank you
1 : Yeah we have all three treasures
4 : K uh
1 : Um
4 : Twilight
1 : Wait
1 : did we move this?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : I moved it.
3 : Yup
2 : She did
1 : Oh ok
4 : K Twilight Hollow, Temple of the Sun,
2 : Oh my gosh this is nerve wrecking. Please don't say Coral Palace.
4 : Cave of Shadows,
4 : and Coral Palace.
2 : Oh
4 : But you can swim
4 : right?
3 : Yup
2 : (--)
1 : Yeah
4 : So
2 : I'm swimming out there.
3 : You might as well just go there
4 : Is that an action?
4 : Or is it
3 : Swimming does not count as an action.
2 : Oh ok
4 : Oh ok
4 : Perfect, that's good.
1 : Yeah
2 : We're doing great.
1 : And
4 : So now it's your turn but I guess you just
1 : Uh
3 : I would just shore stuff up
1 : well
1 : can I lift her to me and then lift all of us out?
2 : Can you Helicopter Lift
3 : Yeah you can lift her to there
2 : Oh do that
3 : Yes you can.
4 : Wow
2 : Do it
1 : Does that like mean we win?
3 : That means
4 : I guess we can do that.
3 : that means we win.
1 : I think that's how it works right?
2 : Can I do that?
2 : Ten points.
1 : And then like we're outta here,
1 : Right?
3 : Cool
2 : Yay
4 : Goal
3 : (--)
4 : Good job
2 : With two minutes, oh my gosh.
4 : I can't believe that worked, yay
3 : Wow
2 : That was nerve wrecking.
1 : That was
1 : yeah

2 : That's intimidating.
1 : We're gonna die
2 : Alright
2 : Well I think you have to be
2 : on like, you can't do this one cause you're not
2 : adjacent to it.
2 : I think you have to move first if you wanna do that one.
2 : Like you could do this one, but you couldn't do that one
1 : Are you sure?
2 : I am pretty sure
3 : (--) since diagonal
2 : It's either up, down, left, or right.
2 : Yeah
1 : And I thought we can just do any of them
2 : I think you hav- you have to be
3 : Um
2 : adjacent to them.
2 : Unless, what is your, what is your special action?
3 : Well you can do
3 : two per-
3 : You can do
1 : (--) per action
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh yeah, you can do two but you still have to be adjacent to them.
1 : Two per
1 : (--) ok cool
2 : Ok
1 : Sweet
3 : So that one you can't do either
1 : Well
3 : Oh you're right, I'm sorry
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, ok, yeah you're good.
1 : Ok, that's one action. Alright
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : So much pressure
2 : Mm
1 : Ok, another action, hmm
1 : Oh
1 : two, that's my second action.
1 : Third action
1 : Bam
2 : That looks good
3 : Nice
1 : And then
1 : draw two of the Treasure Cards
1 : Thank you
1 : No
1 : Already
1 : Ok
1 : uh
1 : so
1 : Ok, shuffle the flood discard
2 : (--)
1 : pile
2 : Ok, yeah shuffle these
1 : (--)
1 : And then
2 : Put those there
2 : and then we discarded that
2 : Ok, I already did that, yeah
1 : And then
1 : Oh yeah, you did, ok, ok
2 : Um
3 : So now you have to take
3 : two
1 : And draw flood cards, oh yeah I gotta take
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, so draw two flood cards.
1 : Uh this is complicated.
3 : It's a lot of (--) part
1 : Ah I gotta flood these
1 : We flood these already?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, ok, so Gold Gate
3 : So Gold Gate
2 : Ohp, man he's already gone
1 : Oh no!
3 : So take that
1 : And
1 : Breaker's
1 : Bridge
2 : Right there
1 : Ok
2 : Thank you for shoring that one up
2 : Alright
2 : So are we good then? So then does this one go here?
1 : Yeah did we
2 : And I think that hangs out there
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Uh, let's see wehre- You have two fire and the chalice, what do you have?
3 : Lion
2 : Ok so I can hypothetically give this to you
2 : that would be potentially helpful
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright, I'll do that
1 : (--)
2 : And then
2 : I will
2 : shore this guy up
1 : Yeah
2 : And I don't think I really wanna do anything else.
2 : If you're not on it or adjacent to it
2 : Oh, shoot
2 : I thought I was you
3 : Yeah (--)
2 : I literally just told you you couldn't do that
2 : Alright so I'm gonna move and then I'm gonna do that.
2 : Ok, super
1 : Can't stop this
2 : Ok so then I do two- Is it always two Treasure cards?
1 : Yeah
3 : I think so, yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright I got sandbags and this guy
3 : Oh sandbags is good.
2 : And then
1 : sandbag!
2 : Yeah that is good
2 : K Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon
2 : So that's right here
1 : And Lost Lagoon
2 : Ok
1 : And then
2 : Cool
2 : And I think that's it
1 : um
3 : So do you wanna save your sandbags?
2 : Um I- yeah I think I wanna save that for a special occasion.
3 : Ok
2 : We don't really need Lost Lagoon, right? because it's not a special tile where you like trade in for a treasure
2 : So like I really don't care if that one dies
3 : Ok, so maybe my actual move
3 : up
3 : and then I'll
3 : turn this over
2 : That looks good
3 : And (--)
3 : Let's see
3 : I have a lion, maybe I should move to a lion card
3 : Towards one.
2 : Up to you
3 : See there's one here
1 : Mm
3 : Oh so you guys are
1 : (Get that one)
1 : Oh
2 : Oh yeah you could move towards that
1 : (--)
2 : So what have you done so far?
2 : All you did was
2 : Did you move?
3 : I moved
2 : And you shored up
1 : Oh you already turned over
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Then you could move on that one and then potentially shore up Phantom Rock in the future but you don't have to
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, cause if
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : Ok
3 : So lemme take two cards
3 : so I have another Helicopter Lift and then
2 : Alright, you're loaded
1 : Yay
2 : Ok and then two more of these
1 : Mm
2 : K Whispering Garden and Phantom Rock. Oh well
3 : Ok
2 : We tried
1 : Aw we did try
3 : Whispering
3 : Rock
3 : Oh
3 : Garden
1 : (--)
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : So we just hang out there for now
2 : Alright
3 : You're turn
1 : Aw guys this is stressful.
1 : Um
1 : Yeah
2 : That's a good call
1 : Um is this considered a- This is not considered adjacent
3 : Two per action, I think
2 : That's diagonal to you
3 : Oh yeah, you're right
1 : Ok
2 : So you could just move down one and then shore it up
1 : Yeah
1 : I could do that
1 : Yeah, well we're doing that
1 : Bam
2 : Alright, cool
2 : And then
1 : Um and then two of those
3 : (You have a )
1 : What?
2 : Yeah you have a third action potentially
1 : Was that- Wait ok, that was one, one
1 : two,
2 : Oh you moved me, not you
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah- Alright, oh, ok
1 : Ok
3 : This color is her
1 : I'm red- Aw ok, I'm red
2 : Yeah, yeah- Red. You're red, I'm gray.
3 : Aw she's not gonna remember it that way
1 : Mm
2 : Ok
2 : I don't feel like-
2 : I mean you could like potentially move back towards the center if you wanted
1 : And then
2 : Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Maybe start moving towards one of those.
1 : Ok, so I'll try to get over there.
1 : Uh yeah, I'm just gonna go down, oh mm
3 : So you have the fire
1 : Wait let me (--)
3 : Whatever that's called. And then you have the chalice
2 : Yeah, fire or chalice, so yeah. Just- I would just like, move in one
3 : (--)
2 : Back to Whispering- Yeah whatever. Yeah that's good, that's good. Ok. And then two of these
1 : Like here? Cause then we can
1 : And then
1 : and then two of these
3 : Three actions
2 : So what did you just do?
1 : (--) that was three.
1 : Wait, I was here?
3 : Save
2 : So you shored up that one, then you moved, oh, and then you shored up another one so you can't move again.
3 : Ok so you can just stay here?
2 : But you could, you could move there instead of Bronze Gate, do you know what I mean?
1 : So I shored this, I moved here, and then moved here.
2 : No, cause you shored this one up
1 : That was three
1 : I did?
1 : No
3 : No you didn't shore up- I think you turned this over, you moved here
2 : I think so
1 : I didn't (shore) that
1 : Moved there, and then I moved there
2 : And then move
1 : I didn'- That was three actions.
1 : Yeah
1 : Cause it was like- I'll flip
1 : two,
1 : three. That was three actions
2 : Ok, I believe you
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Oh, yay!
2 : Alright, so you have to discard a card, so maybe get rid of the- that one, yeah
1 : Oh ok, maybe this lion
1 : Oh I have to discard it
3 : I guess here
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok, and then, yeah
1 : And then
1 : Water level
2 : Bum bum bum
1 : Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon.
2 : Temple of the, the Sun. Ok there we go.
1 : Yeah
1 : And then, here.
2 : Yup, just put those right there.
2 : Ok
2 : so
2 : what should I do?
2 : There's not really anything I can shore up close to me
2 : I don't really wanna give you guys any of my cards cause that would make no sense.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : I suppose I could move towards Temple of the Moon to shore it up and because I have these. Ok so I'll move once,
1 : (--)
1 : Mm
2 : move twice,
2 : and shore this up.
1 : Woo
3 : Nice
2 : Ok
2 : Cool
1 : Yeah
2 : (--) are these
3 : Um
1 : (--)
2 : That's no fun
1 : Yeah I assume that water is (--)
2 : I know, I'm sorry
2 : K so that takes care of that, we gotta shuffle these
2 : Put those there, ok.
2 : Then I pull three
2 : Iron Gate,
2 : Lost Lagoon,
2 : and Whispering Garden. K there's Whispering Garden
2 : Island
2 : What is it?
2 : Iron Gate
3 : This is gone.
1 : Uh that's gone.
2 : And
1 : And
3 : Thanks
2 : And Lost Lagoon, where's that?
1 : Right here
2 : K
3 : See it?
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : And that's my turn.
3 : Ok, so
3 : I forgot I have these Helicopter Lifts, so
1 : So what do those do again?
1 : Oh yeah you can move
3 : I can move to
2 : So you can move somebody to another spot on the board
1 : Move your person
1 : Mm
2 : if necessary
3 : But I don't think we're at that point yet, so
2 : No, I don't think we need to yet
1 : We're not at that point yet
2 : So I would give her your fire card and then you're just gonna have to get rid of that chalice card unfortunately
3 : Um
3 : yeah
1 : Yay
1 : So we do this immediately
2 : I don't think we can. I think that counts as an action.
3 : No, you have to move
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh
2 : Oh, you need to be on the same tile as her
3 : Oh, forgot
1 : Only you can do that
2 : Oh snap only I can do that.
1 : You can only do that thingy
3 : (--)
2 : Ok, you guys are like literally on opposite ends of the board
3 : Ok
1 : So we're gonna work on that
2 : Ok yeah maybe just start- Or you can use one of your Helicopter cards to move her
3 : So red
1 : Yeah
2 : to the same tile as you.
1 : Yeah
3 : I think that actually
2 : I think that's a good idea cause then she's already on the fire tile
1 : That's smart.
3 : Yeah
3 : And then if we save one for the end, cause I have two so. Ok, so, that's one action
2 : Yeah, so we should be good
2 : That doesn't even count as an action, that's like a special action card, so. Ok so then you can give her that
3 : Oh right, this is anytime. yeah ok
3 : So that's one action,
3 : I see
1 : And then we
2 : That's one
1 : And then we take this immediately, right?
3 : Uh, that's yours, yeah
2 : I think that counts as an action in your turn
1 : Oh
2 : Yeah, cause that's an action type
2 : So you just gotta hold on to those. So discard one of the chalices
1 : Oh ok, alright
2 : Cause you don't have enough space in your hand.
1 : Do I do this now?
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : Cause, yeah, I think we can only have five
1 : Alright, yeah
2 : Yeah, you can only have five. Ok, so
3 : So I have two more actions left
3 : I don't really
2 : Maybe you want to- You could move to a different- You could like move to
2 : a spot like that and shore up a card, because you have- You're a Pilot, you can
2 : use that as one of your moves.
2 : You like don't have to step one at a time.
3 : Right, so
2 : I feel like Whispering Garden is somewhat important slash almost sinking.
1 : I don't know if she can
3 : So I can fly here
1 : Yeah, that's imp- That's important cause that's a
2 : Yeah you can fly there and then you can flip it over.
3 : And then turn
3 : so that's three.
2 : Cool
3 : Ok
2 : So then you get two treasure
3 : So sandbags and then
3 : whatever this is, I forget.
2 : The earth stone
3 : Earth stone, ok
3 : Then, three
2 : Three of these, oof. Ok, Temple of the Moon,
1 : Oh no
2 : Breaker's Brigde,
2 : and Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Ok
3 : I forget when do we shuffle?
2 : So that's when the Water's- We could pull up like a Water's Rise card and it goes back on top.
3 : When we-
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, so then you
1 : Ok
2 : can turn those in
1 : yeah
1 : And let's see, I'm red, ok.
1 : Ok
2 : S- yeah
1 : And then
3 : So that's
3 : two
2 : No that's three, cause the trade in is- counts as one.
3 : Oh you don't- That's three.
3 : Ok
1 : Oh (--), oh yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : And then three of these
2 : Ok, cool
2 : I always get nervous now when we pull those cards
1 : (--)
1 : howling Garden, Crimson Forest, and
1 : Copper Gate
2 : Copper Gate's there, Crimson Forest is above.
2 : Whoof
3 : Wow
1 : At least we're still alive
2 : It's true, we haven't
2 : sunk yet, ok.
2 : So
2 : now what?
2 : I think you guys should give me your earth stone cards at the earliest opportunity cause then I could trade that in
3 : (-- can)
2 : But right now, I think I should probably shore some stuff up.
3 : Yeah
3 : So this one is the-
3 : What is it called again? The
3 : Earth stone
2 : Earth stone, yeah, so I should shore that one up.
3 : Maybe you can go and maybe you can go here too and then shore
1 : Yeah
3 : Well maybe shore this up
3 : too.
1 : Just shore both of those.
2 : I could shore up all- Oh yeah, mm, mmhmm
3 : Yeah and then move
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : That seems like a good idea. Should I in the mean time use my sandbags to shore something else up? Or should I
1 : Ye- Yeah shore
1 : No, no, we're not
1 : I mean
1 : Maybe that one cause that seems important cause it has the treasures
1 : on it.
2 : We also have Whispering Garden though so should I hold on to it? I feel like I should still keep this in the reserves, I don't know.
1 : Oh
1 : um
1 : Yeah just keep it
2 : Ok
1 : and then shore up both of these up
1 : and move here so you can do that later.
2 : Bam bam
2 : bam.
2 : Ok
3 : I have a sandbag as well.
2 : Ok, yeah so, we've got those
1 : So yeah, you use, use it for that
2 : I feel like once- Should I use it?
3 : Maybe you should use it for this
2 : Cause we always have Whispering Garden, as long as that one doesn't sink we're ok
1 : Oh ok so-
1 : Well that was three moves though.
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah, sorry.
3 : Yeah
3 : But the sandbag can be used at
2 : But this is an extra
3 : um any time.
1 : At any time?
2 : Yeah
2 : I feel like once we're down to like one of these things, then we can start using our sandbags. Do you know what I mean? Ok
3 : Ok, yeah, that works
1 : Well
1 : but we're risking that though, like cause like if that gets picked
2 : Then we still have
1 : then we're gonna lose that whole
2 : them- No then we still have this guy.
2 : We still have the-
2 : this guy
2 : on there.
2 : So we could still use this tile to capture that treasure.
2 : Cause like we have two- There are two tiles for each of the treasures
1 : Mmhmm
2 : so like I feel like once we're down to one tile that's when we start using our sandbag.
1 : But we're not like, we can just be safe with it
1 : and do it now and we don't ever have to like keep losing tiles, you know
2 : That's true.
2 : Do we wanna do that?
1 : Cause we have a time limit
2 : I just don't know how many sandbags are in the deck
3 : Uh
3 : that's exactly-
1 : We also have a time limit
3 : Uh
2 : Like what if we're super desperate? What if Fool's Landing needs to-
2 : needs a sandbag
1 : I feel like you should definitely use yours for that one. She shuld probably save hers cause we don't have any other ones that have treasures on it.
1 : (Easy)
3 : I feel like we should save at least one for the Fool's Landing
2 : Ok, then I can use the one if we feel good about that
1 : Yeah, let's use that one for this one, just for right now, cause these other ones are just like
1 : not important
2 : They're less important.
1 : Yeah, and we can save her sandbag
2 : Ok, that's fine.
1 : That's what- I think (--)
1 : just be safe
2 : Alright.
2 : So then I still have to pull two Treasure Cards
2 : Gosh dang it
1 : It's always you!
2 : I know, it's always me.
2 : Ok, that goes there
2 : At least it's still at three and we're not at four yet. Once we hit four I think it's like bad news (bears) from there on out.
2 : Ok
1 : We're doing pretty well, I think
2 : Copper Gate, Crimson Forest, Howling Garden. Oh well
3 : Oh, this one
2 : a
2 : K, Copper Gate and then Crimson Forest. Oop Crimson Forest
2 : is hitting the dirt.
3 : Where's
1 : No
3 : (--)
2 : Alright
1 : We tried, see, cause you were there
2 : It's true, I know. Copper Gate would've bit it if I didn't shore that one up.
1 : You were there
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok, um
3 : So my turn, so
2 : Yes
3 : I should give you
1 : Yeah
2 : Thank you
3 : one
3 : That's one action
2 : Oh, on the same- Oh not that again
1 : Oh ok
3 : I just (--) it-
3 : When she started walking I just knew
1 : You should hi- Ok, so Helicopter, well
1 : Helicopter
2 : So you could, you could
3 : Ok
2 : Pilot to me or you could Helicopter. I think you should save that Helicopter
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok, what's a Pilot
2 : So you could Pilot to me if you wanted?
1 : Yeah Pilot
2 : But you also don't have to feel pressured to Pilot to me
1 : I feel like you should totally feel pressured
1 : Cause I'm gonna do this late- like right after you
3 : Yeah, I think that's it- Cause you're on the
1 : Yeah
2 : But how are you gonna-
3 : card, so.
1 : How am I getting to you? Wait, wait, pause, don't do it yet.
2 : I'm gray. How are, how are you gonna get to me is the question?
1 : You're gray
1 : and I'm red
1 : Boom, boom.
1 : Actually no, that's not on yours, that's not on- Hmm.
2 : I mean you could use all three of your turns to get to me- Or three of your actions to get to me but then
1 : Boom, boom
2 : we're
1 : (--)
2 : Just abandoning
1 : But then I'm- Like how am I gonna get over here anyways. I can't even do that like one, yeah
2 : It's true, yeah.
1 : And then she's over here (--)
1 : She's over here.
3 : Yeah that's me.
1 : Do you have any more turns left?
2 : So you could, you could shore this up
1 : Do you have a turn?
3 : (--) three.
1 : Oh see she can
3 : I just started.
2 : So you could shore this up, move to me, and then give me the card
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : I think that works
2 : I feel like that's a good compromise, ok.
1 : Yeah
1 : yeah
2 : So shore Breaker's Bridge,
2 : move to- I'm gray.
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then give her your thingy
2 : And then give me the earth stone. Thank you
1 : And that Pilot
1 : card we have to give up to right? Cause you-
2 : No
1 : Did she Pilot?
3 : This is just my um
2 : No cause that's just like her regular card
1 : Oh
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : well that was three.
3 : So I have another Helicopter Lift and then lion
2 : Alright, that's good to know.
2 : Alright, cool
1 : Ok
3 : So, can I have three?
2 : Lost Lagoon,
2 : Whispering Garden and
2 : Temple of the Moon.
2 : So Lost Lagoon is gone,
1 : No
3 : No
2 : Whispering Garden and Temple of the Moon.
3 : Thanks
2 : Mmhmm
1 : So what was the plan again from here?
3 : So you, you have to give up that card. So you have to first move
1 : (I don't think --)
1 : First move to her
2 : Right, so you were gonna take all your turns to move to me
1 : (Great)
1 : One,
2 : Do you feel bad about that?
1 : two, three
1 : One, two, three and then I can give you (one) card- That's not a move
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Right
1 : Ok
2 : Oh, no that is a move
1 : That's a move
2 : Snap
1 : (--)
2 : I mean you could just like move
1 : So you can't take a card, you can only give cards
2 : Right
3 : What about if you just move
2 : You could just like shore up a coup-
3 : Twice
2 : Yeah
3 : Nah, cause you need to be on here too
2 : I know
2 : But I could just hang out there next turn
2 : or like
2 : What if you
1 : You can hang out there, you can shore this up
1 : hang out there, I'll shore this up.
2 : What about- I feel bad if for Whisp- We have both of these
1 : Move here.
1 : Mm
2 : that are
2 : compromised
3 : Yeah maybe should stay because I have two Helicopter Lifts, I can move
1 : You have those Helicopters
1 : she can always do that
1 : like you know.
3 : Move you
2 : to
3 : to you
2 : me, yeah
3 : And
3 : then
1 : But you could also just move to one of these places and shore it up at any time.
2 : That's true.
3 : At any time, yeah, that's true.
1 : Any time- So I'm gonna come over here,
2 : If
3 : Mm
1 : shore this up, then move here
3 : But that means- I have two turns, but you
2 : I'm just
3 : both of you- So that means that's six
3 : flood cards, so we might lose.
2 : I feel like you should shore this one up and then one of us can get this one, cause it's, cause you'll still- If you do one, shore up two, you'll still be on Misty Marsh by the end of it.
1 : (Well)
2 : And we're closer to that one
1 : one
1 : Shore up
2 : shore it up and then move to Misty Marsh
3 : That's two.
1 : Oh, ok. Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.
3 : Well
3 : maybe you should move
3 : towards the
3 : chalice
3 : though,
3 : cause you have two chalice cards.
2 : But she needs to be on the same tile as me in order to give me the card.
1 : Yeah I need to
3 : I keep on forgetting that
1 : Yeah ok, (--) one,
1 : and then two,
1 : three
2 : Ok, cool, so then you get two of these
1 : And
1 : Ooo
2 : Oh dang
3 : Oh my gosh
2 : Alright
3 : You're ready
2 : And then
1 : Wait
2 : three of these, wah, wah, wah. Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : (--)
2 : and Caves of Ember.
3 : Here's Caves of Ember
1 : Ok, looks like we're still alive.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : and what was the first one?
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ok
1 : we are still alive.
2 : Ok
2 : Cool
3 : And
3 : oh you don't have the sandbag anymore, I forgot.
2 : I know I used it
2 : but I saved Howling Garden, so
2 : Ok
2 : I feel like we should- I should shore up Temple of the Moon
1 : Mmhmm
2 : primarily
2 : Do we feel good about that?
1 : And then you're gonna hang out over there. You could a- You could shore this up
1 : Move here
2 : And shore Copper Gate up
1 : (--) shore that up
1 : and we'll still be really close
2 : (--) Cliffs of Abandon
1 : together.
2 : That's true.
2 : I do think that's a good move.
2 : Or should I give
1 : And she could go save any of these with her little
1 : Helicopter- I mean Pilot thing.
2 : It's true
2 : I feel good that you have the Helicopter things and in order for you to get all of these anyways you're gonna need to use the Helicopter things, do you know what I mean? Or at least one of them and a sandbag
2 : Ok, so I'm just gonna do that then
2 : Or shore this up,
1 : Mm
2 : sorry
2 : And then move here and shore this up
2 : Ok
1 : Yay
2 : Alright, so I've gotta get rid of some cards. So I think I don't need these
1 : Just give (out) both of those. Yeah
1 : (--)
2 : Ok, and then
2 : Silver Gate, Dunes of Deception,
2 : and Coral Palace.
1 : We're still alive
1 : I love how we're not losing any (--) right now.
2 : Ok
3 : Did you get all of them?
3 : I didn't pay attention.
1 : Yeah, I, I- This- yeah, that one
3 : Ok, ok
2 : Yeah, ok
3 : So my turn
2 : Your turn
2 : So you might wanna think about some- shoring some stuff up.
3 : So
1 : We, we got this over here. Maybe we got this so, maybe these corners
2 : Maybe you wanna fly to some other place
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah these corners are like creepy
1 : Like these two, maybe. The one's with the treasures on it.
3 : Maybe like
2 : I feel, I feel like the stuff in the center is the more, more important
3 : That's the one that
1 : That one
1 : Yeah, yeah
3 : Cause that's how we're moving around.
2 : Right
3 : So, I can fly here,
1 : Uh huh
3 : then turn this
3 : around,
2 : Mmhmm
3 : then maybe turn
1 : Oh yeah
2 : Turn Cliffs of Abandon around, cause that's like our access point.
1 : (Yeah)
2 : We still have Whispering Garden, even though
3 : I think so, just
1 : Oh ok
2 : Howling Garden is
1 : Ok, yeah
2 : And we still have Cave of Shadows so, yeah, I feel like
2 : our access points are important,
2 : cause you can only fly us around so much.
3 : Ok
3 : should I be-
3 : So for your next move, you will
1 : I'm gonna trade
2 : hand me the
3 : There's
1 : I'm gonna trade this in first, for the treasure
3 : the
2 : and then hand me that
2 : card too.
1 : Hand you this
3 : I would trade that in
3 : for treasure.
1 : I'm giving this (--)
3 : So you're gonna first- Yeah
2 : Oh you need to be on a chalice spot in order to trade in
3 : So I guess you
1 : I do?
3 : You would
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : So you could
2 : give me that card
2 : and then move two spots and then on your next turn you could trade in
1 : And then boom, boom
1 : And then
1 : Ok, yeah, cause I'll be chilling there. Nothing can do anything to me
2 : Yeah, it's not
2 : flooded so that's good.
1 : Yeah.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : Alright
3 : Cause I have, I have one more move. I was thinking maybe if we could
2 : You could use a Helicopter card to fly up but then she would still have to give the card to me if we want to play that.
1 : Oh, well this one
3 : Fly you
1 : Oh no, you don't have to fly me right now, I'm fine.
3 : Ok, it's all just
2 : Alright, I feel good about that
2 : ok.
3 : Alright
3 : so
3 : these two
2 : You have to discard
2 : two cards,
3 : Oh jeez
1 : (--)
2 : so you might as well get rid of the fire and chalice
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, these
1 : Yeah
3 : Alright
2 : Alright
3 : then, three
2 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Tidal Palace, oh great.
2 : Temple of the Sun
1 : (--)
1 : I mean
1 : I'll still be the (--)
2 : Then where's Bronze Gate?
2 : It's over here.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Alright, so
2 : Thank you. K I'm gonna get rid of this
3 : You've been trying to do that
1 : And then I'll just move there in two.
1 : Someone please help me
2 : Or you could move to Copper Gate and unshore- And shore that up. I think that would be a better play cause then you can just hop right over for your next turn
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : Oh my gosh
2 : and it's safe
3 : I didn't think about that, that's good.
1 : Yeah, ok
1 : Oh yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Thank you
2 : Oh no!
1 : Don't do that, that's (lame). At least I got one of these though!
3 : Ah nice, ok
2 : That's true, that's good
1 : But we're still on three, ooo
2 : It's true, we're still on three so give me the Water's Rise card
1 : and then
2 : Guess that's done
1 : and then
2 : and then shuffle these. We gotta do that first
1 : Oh yeah
2 : Alright
2 : and then you pull three.
1 : Ok
1 : Bronze Gate,
1 : uh Coral Palace, Dunes of Deception. Ah, oh no
2 : Wah, wah, wah
2 : Don- Dunes of Deception are also gone and then Coral Palace is right there.
1 : (--)
3 : Dunes of Dec-
1 : Ok
3 : (--)
3 : Oh
2 : Alright
1 : Ok we're- We're really not dying as fast as I thought we were gonna be dying
2 : That's good, that's a good thing I think
2 : Ok, so I think I should shore up Silver Gate, just cause I'm over there, why not?
2 : And then move to Temple of the Moon and then trade in
3 : Yeah
3 : (--)
2 : Unless you want me to give you- No I think you should hang on to those cards, maybe use one, and then I can give you this card later.
3 : (--)
3 : Ok
1 : You can use those sandbags soon
2 : Bam and
3 : We're getting nervous
1 : We're getting to that point
2 : I don't know what to do with those but you can have them. Either put them there or there and I don't know
3 : I think
3 : Oh
3 : To capture a treasure we just-
2 : You discard the four matching treasure cards while in the corresponding (--). It doesn't say where to discard them to
2 : Oh to the Treasure Card discard pile
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, cool. So now we have this, that's good. We're two- We only need one more guys
1 : Yay
2 : Ok
2 : and that's my turn, so then
3 : So, ok, so it's my turn. Oh
2 : Still gotta do that and one,
2 : two,
2 : three. Ok, so Copper Gate,
1 : We have like ten minutes.
2 : Temple of the Sun and Tidal Palace.
3 : So Copper Gate
2 : Temple of the Sun is now gone.
2 : And Tidal Palace. So aren't we glad that we shored that up last turn?
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Uh, ok
2 : And, that is now my turn.
1 : Is that all for-
1 : Who's turn?
3 : Yeah, so now it's my turn.
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh ok
3 : So
3 : your special talent is you can
3 : give
3 : each of us two
2 : A card without being
2 : on the same tile as you.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok, that's it
1 : You can a- You can also go diagonal, you haven't done that yet- Oh you can't? You can go diagonal
2 : No, I can't go diagonal, nnmhmm that's the Explorer.
3 : Oh, ok
2 : Yeah
1 : The empty person, you're so helpful
2 : Ok so I think
3 : So, let's see
2 : if you can sandbags Tidal Palace I think that would be a really good move because we need her to trade in there.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : K
3 : so
3 : sandbag
3 : That's not an action
2 : Ok, so that doesn't even count as a turn, so that's good.
2 : Um
3 : I don't really- I'm not really useful for these
2 : Yeah, cause if she's gonna do that then it doesn't really matter.
1 : You should do another- You should do another Helicopter and shore something else up.
3 : So
3 : well I can shore these two up, as well.
1 : Oh shore both of thsoe up, both of them
2 : That might be a good idea
2 : cause they're close to Fool's Landing, if we like get desperate, you know
3 : Mmhmm
3 : so
1 : (--)
3 : one, two, and then maybe I should move- So I'll turn these two over so it's two actions and then maybe I should move
3 : here cause I'd be near
2 : You could move to Fool's Landing, cause after she gets that one we only need three treasures and then we can get outta here
1 : Or you can move down
3 : K, so yeah, that works, so
3 : turn this over-
3 : Oop sorry
3 : well it doesn't matter.
3 : Ok
2 : So, is that three turns? Did you do anything before that?
3 : Um I
2 : You just sand bagged
3 : Oh, yeah, so it's three, yeah.
2 : Ok, which doesn't count, so you're good.
1 : Ok
3 : So, I have another sandbag and then a
3 : chalice or whatever.
2 : Alrighty
3 : Oh, let's see
2 : And then three of these
3 : So I have five
3 : cards- or six. So I'll get rid of
2 : Ok, so you- Just discard the chalice or something
1 : And let go of the- yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Um Whispering Garden, Caves of Ember,
2 : and
1 : Garden
2 : Howling Garden.
3 : Oh we lost Caves of Ember
1 : Aw
2 : We lost Howling Garden as well. Man, rough times.
2 : Caves of Ember, Howling Garden, they're outta here.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok m-
3 : Ok, well I'm glad I'm on Fool's
1 : Ok so, is it my turn?
1 : So then I'm gonna shore this up
1 : and then
1 : trade this in for the treasure, and then what else should I do?
3 : You don't have to shore it up, I don't think. You can just
2 : I think it's a good idea if she does though
1 : Yeah, cause I can get back. Like if not, I'm gonna be stuck
2 : I mean you would have to swim, which wouldn't be the end of the world
1 : Yeah
2 : But, cause Twilight Hollow is just hanging out
1 : Oh
3 : That's a- Yeah, I don't know if you need to do that
2 : Maybe just move to Tidal Palace, trade it in, and then
3 : You could move back
2 : You could shore- Yeah you could move back. I think that's a good call
3 : Cause otherwise you'd be
2 : You could potentially be stranded if this one
2 : died and that one
1 : So move
1 : and then
2 : And trade it in
1 : Here you go
1 : And then yes!
2 : Nice
1 : And the-
2 : And then, move back. Yeah, I think that's good.
1 : And then
2 : Ok, two Treasure Cards, good. No Water's Rise
1 : Ok, awesome.
2 : And three of these
1 : And then three of these.
2 : Temple of the Moon,
2 : Breaker's Bridge and Silver Gate.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok, cool.
2 : So I think
3 : So now you guys have to move
2 : we just need to get to Fool's Landing and get outta here
2 : so
1 : I mean we have this one too
3 : At the end of the day I could fly you guys, yeah.
2 : Cause we don't need to get that
3 : Cause we've
1 : When
2 : We'll only need three
1 : Oh
2 : I know, right?
2 : Ok, so
1 : I got a helicopter
2 : So I guess I'll just move towards Fool's Landing and you can always fly me in if need be
1 : (--)
3 : Yeah, me too (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So I'm just gonna go one-
2 : Oh should I uh shore some stuff up in the mean time or does it not matter.
1 : I mean, no, we all have Helicopters and stuff
3 : No, cause you're straight
2 : One, two,
2 : three
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so then you can go
3 : So then I think I can just- Oh well you have to
1 : Do
1 : (--)
2 : Oh, I still have to do this
3 : We're so excited to leave
1 : They're still gonna try to kill us. Oh my gosh I could- Well I can swim though
2 : Water's Rise ok, yeah, we're- We only got six minutes so we gotta, we gotta book it
1 : I can swim though
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, so now we're up,
2 : these get shuffled,
2 : Bam
2 : One, two,
2 : three,
2 : four. So Coral Palace, Silver Gate,
1 : Silver Gate's gone.
2 : Breaker's Bridge, Whispering Garden. K, they're both gone.
1 : Breaker's Bridge is gone
1 : and
2 : So is Silver Gate.
1 : We got all of them?
2 : And Coral Palace is right here and that's the only one that's still there.
1 : Ok
3 : K
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
2 : So now it's your turn
3 : So now I can
1 : This- We're just getting to Fool's Landing?
3 : Move one or more pawns at- Can't I just move you guys?
1 : Oh yeah
2 : So you can do that whenever, so you can just move us both right now
3 : So that's
2 : with those two cards.
1 : Let's just do that
3 : Yeah, cause this is (an action)
3 : so
2 : So
3 : No we need one to leave the island
1 : We
2 : Oh, that's true
1 : And what's the
2 : So you should fly her in and shore this tile up so I don't die.
1 : And then
1 : yeah,
1 : yeah.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : so that's one.
3 : action.
1 : And then shore this one
3 : Or that's not an action, that was just this.
2 : Right, it doesn't even count.
1 : Yeah
1 : Oh
2 : And shore that bad boy up so I don't die.
3 : Shore this
1 : And
3 : Um
2 : And then
1 : And then just be safe till then.
2 : Maybe use a sandbag to shore something else up so the island doesn't disappear before our eyes.
3 : We can use- Yeah
1 : Yeah a sandbag
3 : Alright
2 : I feel good about that
1 : Oh my gosh we're gonna survive you guys
3 : It's pointless, so then, four. Ok
2 : Ok
1 : You have to get rid of a card I think
2 : Oh no she doesn't, cause the Pilot one if her normal card. Ok, Copper Gate,
3 : I have five,
1 : Oh my gosh I keep forgetting that.
3 : I can move this to the side. I know it's confusing.
2 : Temple of the Moon,
2 : Tidal Palace,
1 : It's gone
2 : and Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Tidal Palace is (--)
2 : Tidal Palace is gone
1 : (--)
1 : And then Cities of, of
3 : No I just turned this around, yeah.
2 : Oh, you just turned it over? And then Copper Gate,
2 : where's that?
2 : Right here.
1 : Ok
2 : So those two
3 : Did we do four?
2 : are gone. Oh no
2 : It was Cliffs of Abandon, Coral-
1 : That was four.
2 : or Copper Gate, Tidal palace, and then that one.
1 : Yeah that our four
2 : Ok
2 : and then it's your turn.
1 : Ok
1 : so I'm red.
2 : And you don't need to do anything, right?
1 : I don't need to do anything
3 : Oh can't you
3 : Helicopter lift someone
2 : You could Helicopter
3 : Or does that mean just you?
3 : Wait
1 : I can Helicopter Lift you, you, and then we're done
2 : You could Helicopter me in. I mean it doesn't matter, cause I can just walk there.
3 : Yeah
1 : I mean it- We could just be done right now.
2 : No, cause we still have to have her fly us out.
3 : But if you don't take any moves then do you still have to pull cards?
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok, so maybe
1 : I can Helicopter you
2 : Maybe
1 : Helicopter lift you in and then we can just get her to Helicopter everyone out.
2 : That's true, but everything's gonna flood around us so we just have to keep that in mind.
1 : Do we need to keep this island?
1 : Is that a part of the game?
2 : I guess not
3 : No
2 : No, I think that's fine. Ok, so just Helicopter me in
1 : It's just getting out right?
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah (--)
2 : Bam
2 : and then
3 : K, so
2 : that's fine.
3 : Are you done?

3 : Or three
1 : Oh I still have
1 : Mm
3 : But there's nowhere to
2 : But there's nothing around you to shore up
1 : I get- Ok, so that was one- that wasn't even a move.
2 : That was one move
3 : That wasn't an even a move
1 : That wasn't a move. I can come over here, shore this, shore this
2 : And that up and then walk back
1 : then come back.
1 : yeah
2 : Ok, let- Do that, yeah.
1 : Uh red
2 : Can we not do that since we pulled a Treasure Card already?
2 : Alright
3 : Oh sorry
2 : That's fine.
1 : Wait if you just
1 : What would-
3 : I, I pulled it too fast.
2 : It doesn't matte.r
1 : Oh ok
2 : Alright, Misty Marsh is flipped over, Watchtower is flipped over,
2 : You guys wanna get those?
2 : Observatory is flipped over,
2 : and Cave of Shadows is flipped over.
3 : Wait they can't miss the first- Ok.
1 : Why they doing this to us?
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Someone needs to sh- We can shore those.
2 : Alright so then I can shore
1 : all of this.
2 : That's my first action, that's my second action, and then I'm just gonna call it.
1 : Yeah
2 : Water's Rise, that's fine.
2 : It's crunch time, folks
2 : Alright
2 : Cliffs of Abandon, Coral palace, Copper Gate,
2 : Tidal Palace.
2 : K, Cliffs of Abandon,
2 : Copper Gate,
2 : Tidal Palace,
1 : The other one I don't think we have that
2 : and Coral Palace, right here.
1 : Oh, we still- Oh we do have that
2 : Whoops
1 : Ok
2 : Ok, so now we're good and now it is your turn.
3 : I'll take this
1 : And you can
3 : And the Coral palace
1 : you can shore these, you can shore these two up before we go, you know, just to save the earth a little bit
2 : No Coral palace is still there
3 : Oh
3 : I wanna leave
2 : Yeah, let's get outta here, let's get outta here, seriously.
3 : Ok so, where do we
3 : go?
2 : We just fly away, right?
1 : Can we just go now?
2 : You just put that there and we're outta here
1 : And then
2 : Tada

1 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Go
3 : Mister Engineer
1 : I'll go first, I'm gonna
1 : use my skill
2 : Ok
1 : do that, I'm gonna move, then I'm gonna lift these two up.
2 : we can use your skill.
2 : No, you can't do that, no you can't do that.
1 : Oh, can you use it twice?
1 : That's so dissapointing
2 : Oh, you tried,
1 : Ok
3 : Hmm
1 : well then I'm gonna
2 : you tried.
2 : Ok
1 : Which one do you guys think is better?
2 : So, that was,
2 : that was two actions that you did?
1 : Mmhmm, so now I can lift one more up.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
1 : What do you guys think?
2 : Um
3 : Uh, we don't want to become disconnected from anything
1 : So
2 : I'd do Cliffs of Abandon.
4 : Hmm Hmm
1 : Let's go for it
2 : Yeah,
3 : Mmhmm
2 : because it's in the middle of all of us.
3 : Right, yeah.
1 : Good idea
2 : Ok,
2 : so then
1 : Does anyone have
3 : Draw some cards.
1 : Ok
2 : Oh, yeah.
1 : Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Is it always two?
3 : Yeah, I think so.
2 : Yes.
1 : Ok
1 : Oh, no guys, the water rose.
2 : Alright
1 : So
2 : It's alright.
1 : the Water Rises
2 : (--)
4 : Uh
1 : Help me out again
1 : do that?
2 : I'll put that in the
1 : Put this back.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top. Oh
2 : You go ahead, shuffle it,
2 : shuffle it good.
1 : Alright
2 : And you draw
2 : two.
1 : Two
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So, Phantom Rock
2 : Alright
1 : and Lost- Lost Lagoon, Lost Lagoon.
2 : Uh, we lost Phantom Rock.
3 : Phantom Rock is gone.
1 : Oh we didn't want it anyway.
2 : It's fine, we don't need it
1 : It was like
2 : except for
2 : if we get caught on one of those.
2 : Nobody get stuck on Iron Gate, please.
1 : Eh
2 : Alright,
2 : so,
2 : cool, now it's my turn now, I think.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
3 : Yup
1 : Mmhmm, definitely.
2 : Alright
2 : so,
2 : pick up two, three actions.
1 : It's ok, we don't need that one.
2 : I'm on Silver Gate.
2 : I am
1 : (and this one)
2 : going to- What do you guys think we should do?
1 : How many do you have?
2 : I could
2 : move
1 : Oh
3 : Um
1 : I
3 : Let's think
1 : guess (--)
2 : If I took three actions, I could kind of
1 : You can lift these
1 : one of these up, yeah
2 : Oh yeah, if I come down to Whispering Garden
2 : then I can lift
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Oh, wait oh.
3 : (Was)- Well what about, yeah
1 : One, two, oh I guess it doesn't
3 : What if you were to move here so you could flip both of them? Is it too late for that? Can we-
2 : Uh no, because the actions will still be- It'll still um
1 : You still can only lift one of them.
2 : I can only lift one because I only have three actions. I started out here, one,
3 : Ah true, ok.
2 : two, and then if I move here. So then I'm closer to Cave of Shadows and Coral Palace.
3 : Got you
1 : Same thing I guess
1 : Works for me
2 : So I can get on one of those
3 : Alright
2 : And then, I draw
2 : two of these bad boys-
1 : Hmm
2 : sandbags.
2 : Oh
2 : Earth stone
1 : Nice.
2 : Alright
2 : and then
2 : I draw
1 : Yup
3 : Mmhmm
2 : two of these.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Ah
2 : (See)
2 : it was a good call.
1 : So
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Oh wait, I need to put that on top of there.
1 : Mm
1 : no I thought that was only when this moved.
3 : Uh, let's sett
2 : Um
2 : Yeah, check it first.
3 : Uh
1 : Do you guys remember?
3 : (no idea actually)
1 : Can we ask for help?
2 : Yeah
3 : Feel like we should remember
1 : Can you point to us?
2 : Ok
1 : Water Rise card
1 : Shuffle
3 : Ok, so only when we get the Water's Rise card, were good
1 : Yeah, that's what I thought, ok
2 : Ok, ok.
1 : Great, I guess
2 : Good
1 : So Cliffs of Abandon's right here
2 : K
2 : yeah and Breaker's Bridge so it was good that we
1 : Oh oh
1 : So we should (yeah)
2 : fixed those cause I would've been swimming.
1 : do some fixing.
3 : Um, alright
2 : It's too cold to swim
2 : One, two, three, four, ok
3 : We're set
2 : Um
3 : Ok
2 : (that's that)
1 : So Pilot
3 : Yup.
3 : Yes, I have these
1 : I guess
1 : what do you
3 : (--)
1 : So what's like the plan to do when we don't have many cards (at the end)
2 : You can move anywhere.
3 : Ok
1 : I just like, just,
3 : Uh, we wouldn't try to like appropriate them
2 : I don't know.
1 : just lift things up I guess and like
3 : Lift, yeah and
1 : yeah get ready.
2 : Mmhmm.
3 : and try to- I guess we can always trade cards.
2 : Yeah, try and stack a- Yeah.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Or you know, give cards.
3 : So I guess
2 : (--) try and
1 : So
2 : stack it up some where
3 : Huh, I have
1 : Should we go for Golden Gate because I can definitely get these in
3 : Oh right, because that's the most important
1 : Is it important?
3 : Yeah, it has- Whatever the- Oh that's the starting point, ah.
2 : What's on Gold Gate?
2 : Uh
1 : No, that's just the starting position. I don't even think it really, I don't think that matters.
2 : No, it's just the starting point for a team member that isn't here.
3 : Ok
3 : um, well I don't wanna lo- uh
1 : It's just like
2 : So, if you move to Temple of the Sun or Moon
3 : Yeah
2 : I got two Earth stones things
1 : Wait
3 : Temple of the Sun or Moon
2 : And then
1 : Do one of these have a um mark of wood show on the back- Ok, it would show on both sides
2 : No, it'll, it'll show it on
3 : Uh, no, none of them do.
2 : Yeah
3 : I feel like I should save as many as I can just so we don't- We're not losing tiles right off the bat.
1 : Mmhmm,
1 : true, if you go here you could get both of those.
3 : Exactly, yeah, and they're both on the same tile, that's always good.
2 : Ok
3 : So, I'll move there with my ability
3 : Do that
2 : Can you- Yeah move- You can't flip two.
3 : Yeah, because I'm the Pilot so I jumped,
2 : Oh yes, he can.
1 : The a-he- It's both,
1 : both turns.
2 : Oh that was for all three of your moves.
3 : jumped over there.
4 : Oh
3 : Yup
2 : Ok
1 : wait wait wait wait wait
1 : One,
3 : Right, right
2 : He moved to here for his first first
1 : one, flip,
3 : Flew over there
1 : two-
2 : flipped, two,
1 : F- you have to stay here to flip the other one though, yeah ok.
3 : flipped three.
2 : Yeah, you have to stay there for you to flip
3 : Yeah, yeah, yeah ok
3 : Uh, alright, cool.
1 : Oh
1 : Nice
2 : Nice
4 : Hmm
1 : You are the Pilot
3 : Yeah
1 : (like)
2 : Alright
3 : Uh alright draw these.
2 : Alright
1 : Yeah
3 : Gotta stop wasting time here
2 : (one)
2 : Yeah
2 : We'll get the hang of it.
3 : Whispering Garden, Golden Gate
1 : So Whispering Garden,
2 : and Golden Gate.
1 : Golden Gate's gone.
2 : Alright
3 : Ah
2 : It's alright we need to keep our eye on Whispering
4 : Hm
1 : We don't, we don't want that one anyway.
2 : Garden though.
3 : Mm
1 : Yeah
2 : Because, since we got a Water's Rise card, we're
1 : Alright Explorer.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : not good.
4 : Ok, what do I- Any suggestions?
3 : Yeah
3 : alright
2 : Alright
1 : So, I'd s- You can move diagonally, so I'd say
2 : Um
3 : Mmhmm
1 : move here and then you can lift both of these up.
3 : Yeah, that sounds like a perfect plan.
1 : That's like all three, I think.
4 : Ok.
3 : Yup
2 : Ok
4 : (--)
3 : And I'll just go ahead and pick these cards
1 : and then yeah
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Uh alright
3 : For you
4 : (ok dokey)
2 : Watcha got?
4 : Got uh
4 : two of those,
1 : Nice
2 : Ok
4 : one of those,
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Awesome.
4 : and uh need uh two of those.
2 : Yeah,
1 : yeah
2 : just trying to think, maybe we could, um
2 : start like
1 : yeah
1 : Giving away things
2 : (use-
2 : Yeah, like Earth Stones can come here at some poin- Like when they start,
3 : Yeah we definitely should
4 : So
1 : Yeah,
1 : exactly
3 : Mmhmm
2 : when every body gets their turn.
3 : Uh n-
4 : So
3 : As of now
1 : Oh, so what did you get?
3 : Yeah sorry go ahead.
4 : I got these,
2 : Uh you have to be on the same
1 : Or lifting the Iron Gate
3 : Iron Gate, Temple of the Moon.
4 : Uh
2 : Temple of the Moon is there
1 : Temp- Oh, ok. Uh oh
3 : Alright, I got that one.
4 : Right
2 : Iron- That's Bronze, that's Iron.
3 : There we go.
1 : Ok
3 : So I do notice we both have these, uh
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah
3 : The fire ones and you have two?
1 : Mmhmm, I have a fire too. Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : So um, alright but we can't, we can't give them this turn.
4 : Ok
2 : So, you can
1 : So I guess you're done- Oh, can you pass me those? oh
2 : You can't give them, yeah you have to be on the same- For you guys, you all have to be on the same tile to give cards
4 : These two
3 : Ah to give, (yeah) ok
1 : Oh yeah
4 : Uh
3 : alright
1 : ok
1 : great.
1 : So
1 : I'll move
2 : Ok
3 : You
2 : Yup
1 : One
1 : So I'm red right? So I can go one, two, I can lift this up.
2 : So, ok
3 : (--)
2 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
3 : cool.
1 : And then that's all three of my things.
2 : And two, yeah that's all three of your moves.
3 : Yes, that's it.
2 : And then
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh thank you
1 : And I gotta
1 : (ch)
2 : (--) Water's Rise.
1 : Water Rises again guys
3 : Ah fine fine
2 : Go ahead and move that and I'll shuffle this for you.
4 : Hmm
1 : Can you pass that?
3 : Yeah
2 : Well, I mean we only have one that's- we could get rid of and
1 : Well,
1 : yeah
1 : we don't even want that one.
2 : We're gonna be fine, we don't even need it!
1 : Oh, now I go
1 : Three
2 : Three
3 : Yup
3 : Three more
1 : Whispering Garden we gotta
2 : Son of a nutcracker.
1 : Get that thing out of there
1 : Um Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Cliffs Abandon,
1 : It's right here.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : And
1 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Ok
1 : So this is the
2 : We need to get that out, and we need to get
1 : (Always someone)
2 : um
1 : Is that
2 : We need to ,
2 : we need to get the Explorer onto here
1 : Yes
2 : and then
2 : anybody- And we need to get you back on there
4 : Hmm
2 : and you back on there to give him the cards,
2 : so he can get on there.
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Yes, yes
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
2 : And then I need to make my way here or there.
2 : So
1 : So
2 : My-
2 : Let's see
2 : Does anybody else have the
3 : Hmm
1 : Well
1 : you could um
2 : Ok
1 : you could always sandbag if you want to do that, but you can use that whenever.
2 : I have sandbag.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : But
2 : Yeah
1 : it could be right there and it could just die.
2 : I'm
1 : so
2 : Yeah, no I'm gonna
3 : Yeah
2 : I'm gonna use this right now, just to
3 : For Whispering Garden? That's a good idea.
2 : Yeah, cause I'm not
1 : Ok, so does that- That doesn't count as one of your things?
2 : playing with it. That doesn't count as a turn.
3 : Correct.
1 : Oh, you could've lifted it
2 : Um
2 : I could've lifted a long time ago.
1 : Oh well
2 : Oops
2 : Alright
2 : um
2 : I think what I'm going to do is
1 : Get on one of these things
2 : Yeah, get my way towards there. I can't get on one of them- I can't get on them just yet.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
2 : But like I'll move there, there. And then I'll sit on Cave of Shadows for now.
3 : You, you could move there if you wanted. Yeah, you have one extra action.
1 : Ok, was that- That was one, two?
1 : You could get there right now.
1 : Or you could
2 : Do I?
1 : yeah, that- Wait, wait, or
3 : Yup
2 : One,
3 : Cause the sandbag was uh was not an action.
2 : two,
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah wait, but, but, but do you wanna lift this up before you
1 : and like next turn just go then?
1 : because you have
3 : Yeah, that's true.
1 : Cause you don't have enough- You're not gonna get enough
2 : True
3 : Doesn't, doesn't really benefit anything
4 : yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : No, cause you guys don't have it.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I would need his, which means, he need- would need to come to me
2 : to pass it to me.
1 : So, do you just wanna make one,
1 : just pick
1 : two, three, and pick both of those up.
2 : Yeah, I think that'd be
2 : I can only pick one up.
1 : Wait, wait
1 : this is you.
3 : Uh yeah, yeah
4 : wrong one
2 : I know and I'm moving this so I can
1 : Oh, ok, gotcha, gotcha.
2 : move, yeah.
2 : So, cause-
2 : Oh wait, I can't do that.
3 : It depends if,
2 : It's not adjacent.
1 : Well,
3 : if you were to move here.
2 : If I move- If I stay here-
1 : yeah,
3 : Mmhmm
1 : so that's one-
2 : So one,
2 : two,
2 : ok, and then
1 : and three, yeah.
3 : Ok
2 : three, alright.
1 : There you go.
3 : Cool
2 : Ok, and then
3 : (Cards)
2 : sandbags, yes!
1 : Nice, nice, that's perfect.
3 : Mm
2 : You were telling me not to move. No, it's fine.
3 : Sweet.
4 : Mm
1 : And then three of these guys.
2 : And then
3 : Uh
2 : Ok
1 : So, wait, you're green? You guys are very close.
2 : Ok, Iron Gate is gone
1 : Good,
1 : get that outta there.
2 : Temple of the Moon, oops.
2 : And Lost Lagoon.
1 : Lost Lagoon. Mm
2 : Right there
2 : Alright
1 : great
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : (--)
3 : So I'm here. I have these two, I have to be on the same
1 : Wait, do you have
2 : five
1 : blue?
3 : Uh, yes. So what- Are you- You're here? Yeah I'm gonna give this fire over to the Engineer and then this guy over here
2 : Yeah
1 : Yes, ok
2 : Ok, so wait what cards- What treasure cards do you have? Those two
1 : Could you make your way
2 : Yeah, so you need to- Where's
1 : Get to- I'm at
2 : He's over on Misty Marsh.
1 : Misty Marsh.
3 : Misty Marsh, alright, cool.
2 : You can pass it over while they're on that right?
1 : So one, two, three
3 : So
1 : and then
3 : I will
2 : No, he doesn't, he can
1 : Does that count as a-
2 : That's one move for him.
3 : That's one move
1 : Oh yeah, you are the Pilot, that's great.
3 : Two, ah no, I can't give ah, bummer.
3 : Um, ooo unless I do this. Is it worth it?
1 : One, two-
1 : Wait no, not yet, no.
3 : Is it worth it?
1 : No, d-
3 : Ah but then, nah you still couldn't get it next turn, true
2 : Uh
2 : Oh, but wait, you could
3 : Um, then I-I guess I'll probably save Temple of the Moon at this point. There's not, not a whole lot else I can do without sacrificing too much.
1 : S-
1 : that's a-
2 : Yeah and then at some point you should use that
2 : to get me- Like once
2 : hmm
3 : So what do you need? Are you trying to get yourself over here?
2 : I'm thinking, cause if he, he gives- Yeah get myself over there,
3 : Mmhmm
2 : but then
2 : I need him to give me this.
1 : But he can just do that-
3 : Right, you should um
1 : You can do that in the next turn.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, that's what I'm saying- But he can use these at any point.
3 : True.
1 : Yeah
3 : That's true yeah.
2 : Yeah
1 : But I'm kinda- I'm still scared in case like when we split up
4 : Hm
2 : So he needs to, he needs to save Temple of the Moon.
3 : I think we'll
1 : Yeah saves
3 : Yeah, yeah, save Temple of the- ok.

3 : Uh, (one, two three four five), ok

1 : But then we
1 : Yeah
3 : Then we're good
1 : And then we're good?
2 : Ok
3 : Uh yup, so we got that.
1 : So you can turn that in
2 : and
3 : So that is one turn if I use
1 : Two, four,
1 : five
2 : That's not you
1 : Wait, no, you're here
3 : Yeah, but if I use this to fly us over here, you use this to fly us over here.
2 : Oh wait, oh you're
3 : and one more to fly us out then we're done.
2 : And then we're done.
1 : Wait, wait, wait, wait
3 : Alright, so, one
1 : Oh yeah, I guess cause we can always swim. We're set.
2 : He's using this right now
3 : One card
3 : and then if you were to use another card, because you could use it at any point
1 : Nice, ok
2 : Right, you can use it right now.
1 : Oh, I can use them anytime?
3 : We're here, and then the second one lifts us off. Well (two), and then the second one to- to win.
1 : Boom boom
2 : Yeah, just need one.
2 : two
1 : Two to, now we're gone.
2 : One
1 : Ok, yeah, good
2 : Alright
3 : And we're (done)
2 : Boom
1 : Time?
3 : Yeah

1 : Alright
2 : Ok let me just review here
1 : Alright so it's my turn first
3 : Yes
1 : I guess I should
1 : save these two thingies
1 : But this one's not as important I don't think, since it's on the end
1 : So I'll go here for my first move
1 : and I'll flip over these two,
1 : cause I can flip two.
1 : And I guess I'll flip this one
1 : while I'm at it
1 : and then
1 : take two of those.
1 : Aw shoot
1 : so we're gonna move this thingy up one,
1 : shuffle these,
1 : and then I'm gonna draw two of them.
1 : So Phantom Rock,
1 : alright we lost it already.
1 : That was fast
2 : Hmm hmm hmm hmm
1 : And then
3 : It's ok
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : That's the one I'm on
3 : Yeah
1 : That ws clutch
2 : Ooo
3 : Aw, good job
1 : I need to discard that one
1 : and
1 : (--)
1 : Yeah
1 : That's exactly what it says, ok
3 : That goes in the treasure one
1 : Yup
2 : Ok,
2 : so it's my turn.
1 : Mm
2 : Ok, so I get to move
2 : one place
2 : um
2 : oh wait
2 : ok
1 : Those are the treasure cards.
1 : Not gonna really do much right now
2 : Ok
2 : alright so
2 : I move one,
2 : pull two,
1 : Is that
1 : the end- Is that all you wanna do?
2 : Uh or I could sink something right?
1 : Or
1 : unsink it
1 : (pretty much)
2 : Unsink it
3 : Yeah
2 : I could unsink you
1 : Well, well
1 : why don't we undo that?
1 : If we put this back here then you can unsink it.
2 : Oh
1 : (--)
3 : And then move
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : So that's one turn, and then you still have two more
2 : Ok
1 : What's your special thing?
2 : I can give a treasure card to a player
2 : anywhere on the island for one action.
3 : She has a red card. You could give her your red one.
2 : Yeah but we need four right?
3 : Yeah
1 : And then I would have to- That would hurt me on my next turn.
3 : Oh
1 : Cause I'll have to pick two and then I'll have to lose one of those
2 : Yeah
3 : Never mind, don't do that.
1 : So we don't want that.
2 : So it's just uh
1 : If you wanna move anywhere else
2 : Move one, yeah
2 : we'll go to Misty Marsh.
1 : If (you use your) next two down to here you can save Lost Lagoon.
2 : Oh, ok
1 : So if we do like
1 : here,
2 : Mmhmm
1 : do one move, and then here for the next one.
2 : Yeah, good idea.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Oh wait that would be three,
1 : never mind.
2 : So I'd have to stay there
1 : Cause that'd be one- You'd have to stay there yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok that's fine.
1 : Ok
2 : I'll stay there
2 : Then I take two here
1 : and then
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I get to shore up- (--) one island, play at anytime, does not count as an action.
2 : So I could shore up the Lost Lagoon
1 : Maybe save that for a little bit, I guess
2 : Save it?
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : good idea.
1 : And then so pick two of those.
2 : Ok and then take two of these.
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : and Golden Gate
1 : So we lost Golden Gate.
2 : Oh because it's already flooded.
1 : Oh jeez
3 : Yeah
2 : Golden Gate
2 : and Breaker's Bridge
1 : What's, what's on the
2 : You're on Breaker's Bridge
1 : Alright
2 : Or I'm on Breaker's Bridge
2 : So it floods.
1 : What character is that?
2 : That's
3 : (This)
3 : It's
3 : like a yellow pawn.
2 : That would the um wind
2 : Statue of wind
1 : I don't know what that is.
3 : Mm
3 : nah, that's that one.
3 : I don't know what this is
2 : Oh
1 : We'll deal with that later I guess
3 : Ok, sounds good
2 : Mmkay
3 : Oh wait where does this go?

1 : Your turn
3 : Should I try to undo these things?
1 : This
1 : Uh yeah if you want
3 : Ok
3 : I'll move here for one
3 : um
3 : and do- unflood this for two
3 : and
3 : yeah. I think that's good unless you have other suggestions
3 : No? Ok
1 : No go ahead and take two.
3 : A Helicopter Lift
3 : and the chalice
3 : and then
1 : (Still two of the)
3 : Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon, so we'd lose Lost Lagoon.
1 : Alright so
1 : That's ironic.

1 : Mm
2 : Mm
1 : Here it is
2 : There it is
3 : (Him)
3 : Thank you
1 : Mmhmm

1 : I'm the red guy
1 : I should probably save Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : And then
1 : I'm gonna need a blue thing at some point,
1 : there's one down there.
3 : A blue thing?
1 : The water chalice thingy
3 : Oh
1 : So I'm just gonna move
1 : Cause I have two and you have one so at some point you can
3 : Yeah, so we'll just wait one more
1 : I'm just gonna move
1 : (--)
1 : I guess I'll just stay here.
2 : Mm
1 : I'll just move to Cities of Abandon I guess
3 : Ok
1 : I only have one more.
1 : Uh
1 : I guess I can hang out with
1 : the Pilot
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : Two of these
1 : Cool

2 : Alright so do they both go here because the other one was
1 : Mm
2 : Already filled it? Is that what happens?
1 : No, they're both, they're both good.
1 : Iron- Cause that Iron Gate
2 : Ok yeah
1 : They're both good
2 : Ok
1 : Alright
2 : Alright
1 : Your turn
2 : Ok I'm going to make my way down to How- How-
2 : Um Howling Gardens
2 : so
1 : Are you
1 : Ok there you are
2 : I'll go here
2 : and um
2 : Ooo
2 : I get three moves
2 : Shore up, why would I shore up?
1 : There's nothing for you to shore up
3 : Yeah there's flooded places around you.
1 : in close by.
2 : Oh ok
2 : Give a treasure card of capture a treasure. Hmm I'm not ready to capture yet, I don't think.
1 : No
2 : So I get two more moves?
1 : If you want them, yeah
2 : Yeah, ok then I'll go to there
2 : and then here.
2 : Alright
2 : And then I'll take two of these
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh jeez
2 : Bummer
1 : Water's
1 : So we shuffle this
2 : Mmhmm
3 : And move the
2 : So we move it up once
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Wait do we move it up before or after?
2 : It should've been before but that's I guess
1 : Oh that's true but
1 : otherwise (--)
2 : So we've shuffled and now I discard this to the treasure
2 : discard pile.
1 : And then now you're gonna have to take three
2 : Take three
1 : of these.
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh jeez
2 : That means we sink three
2 : places.
1 : Potentially.
3 : Yeah, we flood them, at least.
2 : Oh no
1 : Not necessarily sink
2 : Temple Moon
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Ah
2 : Oh Whispering Gardens. It's gone.

1 : I have too many.
3 : Uh
3 : she has one red and I have one
3 : purple so, doesn't matter.
1 : Well yeah we
1 : all three have purple so I'm just gonna discard this one.
3 : Yeah
3 : ok
3 : Um
3 : I think we should save
3 : this one cause it's special.
3 : So I'm gonna use my
3 : Pilot abilities and fly here.
3 : That was
3 : two and then
3 : unflooded.
1 : Cool
3 : Ok
3 : sandbags and a yellow
2 : Mm

2 : Ok hold you've captured the guys
3 : I think they (--)
3 : Wait discard cards into treasure
2 : If you discard
3 : Yeah they go over here.
2 : Capture treasures, you discard from (--) treasure cards, (--)
1 : Ok
2 : corresponding tile
2 : discard treasure.
1 : Alright

1 : Copper Gate
3 : It's right here.
1 : Alright
1 : And Tidal Palace
1 : That one has less meaning to us now that we got the
1 : crystal (--) here
3 : Yeah
3 : true.
1 : chalice thingy.
2 : Mm
1 : Alright
2 : Ss
2 : Ok
1 : Your turn
2 : Alright um
2 : Mm
2 : I can't do much
1 : Well if you wanna do like one, two and then save that
2 : Mm ok
3 : Yeah
3 : cause that one's important.
1 : Or wait
2 : One
2 : no
1 : No I was thinking about also doing these
2 : Yeah
1 : if we wanna
1 : get those.
3 : Oh yeah you could give her your cards now and I'll give mine the next time and then when we get to you we could
1 : Yeah ok
1 : Cause you can I think
3 : Wait are you near a yellow thing though?
1 : (--) I'm red
3 : Yeah you're red right?
3 : So you can just move there and then use your cards.
1 : Yeah
1 : Well ok so she has the ability to give me more than one
3 : Yeah I think so
1 : Is that what it is?
2 : No I could give you one card.
1 : Her spec-
2 : Uh give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card.
1 : Oh ok so you can just give it to anyone.
2 : Oh um one action per card.
1 : So if you wanna give me two
3 : Yeah and that can be two of your actions
2 : I could do that now?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : And then you get a third action, you can move or you can stay where you are, it's up to you.
2 : Ok I could stay where I am
2 : and then I will take my two
1 : Ok
2 : Ugh, chalice
2 : This doesn't matter right, cause we're done
1 : Nah
3 : Yeah it's fine.
1 : But you got a Water's Rise (--)
2 : Water's Rise so I move it up one
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And then shuffle the flood
1 : Yup
2 : discard pile
1 : (to these)
2 : and then discard this to the treasure discard pile.
2 : And then put it on top
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Mm
2 : Why not the bottom?
2 : Just asking
2 : Ok
1 : So now you're gonna have to take three
2 : Ah
2 : No
2 : One, two, three
1 : If we lose Tidal Palace it won't be a big deal but
2 : Temple of the Sun,
1 : Ah
3 : Aw man
3 : Ok
1 : (--)
2 : Temple of the Sun twice
1 : One's Temple of the Moon
2 : Oh Temple of the Moon
1 : That's not good either
3 : Can I have the Temple of the Sun card?
2 : Ok Temple of the Sun
1 : And Breaker's Bridge is gone.
2 : And Breaker's Bridge is gone
1 : It's, it's toast.
3 : Ok
1 : (--)
1 : Uh
1 : So yeah just leave that there.
3 : Ok so
3 : I wanna give you this card as one action
1 : Alright
1 : and then I'm gonna
3 : I'm gonna save
3 : this
1 : Ok
3 : as one
1 : I need to get rid of one of these
3 : And I can save this one too right?
3 : Cause I'm next to it.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok I'll save that as three.
1 : I, I have to get rid of one. Should I get rid of the uh purple thing or the red thing?
3 : The red thing because we have two purple things
1 : Alright
2 : (--)
1 : Oh yeah (--)
2 : (--)
1 : But there's two other ones I think
2 : Oh I see
3 : Yeah
1 : We'll do that
2 : Ok
3 : Ok and then I take
1 : Mm
1 : Alright
3 : Uh another Helicopter Lift
3 : and then purple one.
2 : Woo
1 : So you- Ok, how many do you have
1 : total?
3 : I have
1 : You can only have five cards
3 : Oh
3 : One, two, three, four, five, six. Ok so
2 : Mm
1 : Well could you use one of them now.
2 : sandbag
1 : Cause what- some of them don't count as turns.
3 : Oh yeah I can use Helicopters at anytime.
1 : So just yeah- (--) has a turn, just use it.
3 : Both of them? These two?
1 : Just use one
3 : Well I have three
3 : And I have to get rid of two
3 : Wait can I have five?
1 : One, two- Yeah you can have five cards.
3 : Ok
3 : So where should I Helicopter Lift?
2 : Mm how bout saving the edge over there?
2 : Crimson Forest or some place?
2 : Saving something- wait
1 : Just fly somewhere, I don't know.
2 : Well chalice doesn't matter
3 : I can't unsink anything right?
1 : Yeah and we don't really care about the cha-
3 : Just fly
1 : Just
3 : Ok I'll just fly
3 : over here.
1 : Alright
1 : cool.
3 : Ok
3 : And then three of these.
2 : Well wouldn't it make some sense if she unsinked something?
1 : Mm
1 : She can't, she can just fly somewhere
2 : I'm
3 : I don't think I can
2 : Oh I see- Oh just (--), oh ok
1 : Just so we didn't lose a card
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Copper Gate,
1 : Oh jeez
3 : Crimson Forest,
1 : Ooo
3 : and Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Oh no
3 : Ok
2 : Oh ok
1 : My turn
3 : Yes
2 : Phew
1 : I'm gonna
3 : Ok
1 : retrieve this while I can so move that one
3 : Good job
2 : Great
1 : This cool thing
1 : and then
1 : I guess I'll just
1 : go back to Coral Palace
1 : and then
1 : two of those.
1 : Two red thingies
1 : Aw it's a shame I just
1 : got rid of one.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : That's alright.
3 : Ok
1 : And then three of these thingies
1 : Tidal Palace,
1 : that's gone.
1 : Dunes of Deception
1 : and Silver Gate
2 : Mm
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : Messenger's turn
2 : Yeah, alright um
2 : let's see
2 : Ok one
2 : two, can I unsink Dunes of Deception?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok we'll shore it up then or unsink it.
2 : (--) that's two
1 : Mmhmm
2 : and
3 : Wait wasn't that three?
3 : Cause you moved once and then twice and then you
1 : Yeah so that is three.
2 : One, two, three, ok
3 : shore up
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : So pull two
2 : Ok and we have
1 : Aw so we have
1 : four of these in play
2 : So
1 : And you're gonna need to get rid of one
1 : Get rid of this one
3 : Yeah we don't need that chalice anymore
2 : Oh that's true because it's gone. That goes here.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : I already- Yeah (--)
2 : Oh ok and then
1 : So we're gonna (--) we should get the
2 : (--)
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright
3 : So
2 : Cave of Em- Embers
2 : Ok
2 : Cave of Shadows,
2 : bummer.
1 : We're gonna need to keep one of those
1 : alive at some point.
3 : Yeah
2 : Bronze Gate
1 : Here it is
2 : Hmm
1 : Pilot, your turn.
3 : Ok
3 : Who should we give
3 : our purple cards to?
1 : You have two
2 : Oh
1 : Well there's five of them actually in play.
3 : Oh
1 : Cool
2 : Oh
3 : Ok
3 : Cause we need to do that
3 : but I also should save
1 : Save one
3 : We can't
3 : Can we save this one anymore?
3 : Cause there's nothing around it
1 : Yeah it's pointless, don't save it.
3 : So
1 : I mean you could because you can fly anywhere but
3 : Move
1 : don't do it.
3 : Yeah we can't get there anyway.
1 : Keep the Cave of Shadows.
3 : Ok so move and then
1 : Mmhmm
3 : One,
3 : two,
3 : and then
1 : Wait, wait, wait, wait
1 : can we undo that?
1 : Go here
1 : come
1 : instead of going down here, come over here and then we can save these two.
3 : And then not give any of my cards?
1 : I guess you can still save this one but you still have more access to this one than you did before.
3 : Ok, that's fine.
1 : Just so (I have) a safety.
3 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : (--) I don't
1 : Well
1 : we can just give you the card
1 : cause you're gonna be right by here anyway.
3 : Ok so should I use my last one to
2 : Uh
2 : I didn't think that yeah
1 : shore that up yeah
3 : Yeah ok
3 : Ok
2 : Ok great
3 : Chalice and
3 : fire
3 : um
1 : Get rid of the chalice
1 : and then I have two of the fire and then she has one and you
3 : Wait I still have to get rid of one
3 : cause I have six.
1 : Oh ok
3 : Um
3 : or I can use one.
1 : If you wanna just move over to here and then
3 : Yeah ok I'll Helicopter Lift over here
1 : Aight cool
1 : What's sandbag do?
1 : (--)
3 : You can shore up any tile on the island and you can play it at anytime.
2 : Woo
2 : then we should shore up some uh
1 : We don't anything shored up right now, I don't think.
3 : Yeah we should save that for like Fool's Landing
1 : In case Fool's Landing- Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh ok
3 : Ok
1 : Aight cool, my turn?
2 : Yup
3 : Yes
3 : Oh wait I didn't pick a-
2 : Oh yeah
3 : these
3 : Um Watchtower,
3 : Misty Marsh,
3 : and Howling Garden.
3 : And Watchtower, we didn't do that one.
1 : Oh I just realized we have to be on the same tile to transfer cards.
3 : Thanks
1 : The same
1 : tile to transfer cards.
2 : Mm
3 : Did we not do that?
1 : We might have messed that up a little.
2 : Ok
1 : For future reference.
2 : (--) we might have a time now, or a chance.
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : Well alright, (we don't wanna)
1 : It's ok
1 : Am I red?
1 : Yeah, so
1 : I wanna
1 : get to you
2 : That would be your three moves.
1 : Yeah
1 : that would be bad.
3 : Um
2 : Well can't you fl- Oh no, it's not your turn.
3 : Wait
3 : Oh
3 : Am I not allowed to use this if it's not my turn?
3 : It says play at anytime.
2 : Oh then there you go.
3 : I can Helicopter Lift you there.
2 : Yeah that's a good idea
1 : Alright
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : Wait
3 : Should we check to make sure that's real.
1 : Yes make sure that's
3 : Helicopter Lift
3 : let's required to leaves Fool's Island
1 : Yeah but- Oh do you not have anymore?
3 : That's my last one.
1 : Oh jeez
3 : I mean we could get another one eventually but
3 : we might not.
1 : Is it
2 : I think we should take the risk
1 : I think she can transfer them regardless and she has two of them.
1 : So let's just wait.
1 : Cause she- I don't think she has to be
1 : as the uh-
1 : She's the Messenger
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
1 : So the Messenger doesn't have to be on the same tile to give cards so I'm just not gonna give cards and then she can give it to you
1 : and then you can get it.
3 : Oh yeah, ok that's fine.
1 : So let's just
2 : Ok yeah, good idea.
1 : I would shore these two- Or we don't need that one really
1 : But
1 : I have to shore this one up.
3 : Ok
1 : I guess, just we have an extra sport
1 : and then I'll just
1 : move over here just so we have the red. I'm red. Cause I have two and then there's two other ones out there.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok do you take these?
1 : Yeah
1 : I need three of them.
3 : Did you take treasure cards?
1 : No
1 : Can I have two?
1 : Thank you
1 : Oh jeez why don't we (--)
1 : pause on that.
1 : I got a Helicopter Lift.
1 : That's convenient now.
1 : And Water's Rise
1 : Oh jeez, alright
1 : So now I'm gonna need three.
1 : Shuffle these first actually.
1 : Bronze Gate,
1 : is toast.
1 : Cave of Shadows which is what I'm on.
1 : We're gonna need that saved at some point.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : Uh here it is.
1 : Aight cool.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : alright um
1 : So
2 : Ok so I'm going to
3 : You should
1 : give her the two
2 : Give you two- Can you give (--) two at once.
1 : That would be two actions.
2 : Oh two actions, there you go, ok.
1 : And then if you wanna give me the third one and then she can give me that one or
1 : we only need three (--)
1 : Just disregard what I just said.
2 : Ok
3 : I'm right above Cave of Shadows
3 : It's making me nervous cause we need that one
2 : Why?
2 : I can shore it up at anytime.
1 : Oh yeah I need that one because I- we have three treasures and we only need three
3 : Oh perfect, ok
2 : I thought you need four.
1 : You're gonna need to
1 : Oh (give her one)
3 : So this one
1 : What is that?
1 : Yeah just get rid of it cause we don't need it (--)
1 : Uh but now we're just gonna all need to get to Fool's Landing.
3 : Wait I need to get another one.
2 : Will I need to get to Fool's Landing?
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok then I still have one more move.
3 : Yeah but I have to get rid of one of
1 : You have four- Ok
2 : Oh because I gave you those.
1 : Can you just Helicopter cause it doesn't have to be your turn does it?
3 : No I can play it at anytime.
1 : Ok then just play it.
3 : But I don't wanna get away from
3 : Well I guess it doesn't matter cause I can just move there
3 : on my turn.
3 : I was gonna say I don't wanna get away from the chalice but
1 : Or the- Ok um
2 : Um ok
1 : Wait, what's the- Does it have to be your turn to sandbag?
3 : No
1 : Shore that up
3 : Ok
3 : I'll sandbag
3 : Cave of Shadows
1 : Cause we're gonna wanna keep the Helicopter Lift. Well I have one too but that's ok.
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : go ahead.
2 : Uh ok so I get one more
2 : move, right?
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright and then I wanna get close to Fool's Landing right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Mm
2 : Ok so we're good, we're good. One, two
1 : Alright
3 : Dude I'm (--)
2 : Ok
2 : so I have
2 : this and this which we do not need, right?
1 : Yeah that's irrelevant right now.
3 : Yeah
2 : So what we get rid of em?
1 : No just keep em.
2 : Keep them.
3 : Yeah you can just keep em
2 : Oh sorry, keem em
1 : Mm doesn't matter.
2 : And then three
1 : Mmhmm

1 : Three
2 : Three
2 : Ok
2 : uh Temple of the Moon,
2 : bummer
1 : It's still alive
2 : Ok
3 : Mm
1 : Staying alive
2 : Misty Marsh
1 : this way.
3 : Misty Marsh is gone.
2 : and Dunes of Deception.
2 : Ok and I'm done right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Good
3 : So I'll take these
3 : and take

1 : Yeah so you can just fly there.
3 : Yeah I

3 : Or should I
2 : Ok
3 : fly her there and then you can
3 : move there and use your card?

3 : Ok I'm gonna fly you to Fool's Landing
2 : Great
1 : Awesome
3 : Um
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And then

1 : I guess
1 : I mean you don't have to but
2 : Yeah
2 : I'll move
2 : to Misty Marsh

4 : She just did.
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh, you did. Oh I missed it, sorry. Ok, um, I'm gonna fly here and I think
2 : Mhmm
3 : So that's two actions, right? Um and then probably this one too.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : I don't think you can move and flip that one.
3 : Oh I have- No cause I can- I don't have to move to flip it, it just has to be adjacent to me, right?
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh ok, sorry, no I thought you had moved it.

4 : yes, you have
4 : five or
3 : You can't- Can you not give it to me cause you're not on the same thing
1 : Wait, don't- yeah.
4 : Oh wait, yeah.
3 : as me.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : That's the only time you can give it to someone?
2 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : You don't have to move- use your thir- three
2 : You don't have to take three turns, yeah you can can be done.

2 : Yeah, so she's good.
4 : Alright, Temple of the Moon,
4 : and Iron Gate.
1 : Ok.
1 : Um
2 : I would move up one and shore up Temple of the Moon.
1 : Let's
1 : shore up Temple of the Moon.
2 : Yeah but you have to move
1 : I can't shore up diagonally though
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, she'd have to move two.
1 : so I could have to move two.
2 : Wait, you can move twice.
1 : Ok, just cause
3 : Cause we're like scared of them (--)
2 : Cause we- Yeah.
3 : I'm probably gonna fly to you wherever you go so I can give you
2 : and she's close to getting that treasure.
1 : Oh ok, then ok. So I don't wanna move too far. Ok, no that's better.
3 : This
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, if you're at Temple of the Moon I can also give you this too, if you're at the same one as me.
3 : And I can also- might fly you too, I think I can do that.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok, so I could do one, two, and then just shore up this.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : And then I'll move the next time.
3 : Ok
1 : I guess so
1 : I keep getting these.
1 : So Iron Gate

4 : Do I just
2 : Discard-
3 : Mm

4 : Uh
4 : Think you can do whatever.
2 : I guess move, you can move to Fool's Landing.
1 : I guess just this one right?
1 : I can't move diagonally.
2 : Oh no (I can --).
2 : Then you can

2 : So Temple of the Moon,
2 : Coral Palace,
2 : Bronze Gate.
3 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Um
1 : Ok
3 : So now we're all just trying to get here right?
1 : So what if you shore up this and then just do one, two, and then it'll be like
2 : Uh huh
1 : three.
3 : Shore up this?
1 : Yeah, so that way she can- It doesn't- She won't like risk
2 : Yeah shore up the ones closest to her.
1 : losing that
3 : Ok
3 : and then
3 : what?
3 : Just,
1 : Do one, two.
3 : I can just move though, yeah. So like, so I'll shore up like
4 : She can fly herself.
2 : She doesn't have to, yeah.
1 : Oh, right, right, right, right, right, oh sorry.
1 : Sh- Yeah, shore up that one.
3 : This too.
2 : Yeah
3 : Two and then
3 : We're good?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Also, like
3 : K
2 : Yeah
3 : I can just move you right, right now. I can use this at any
2 : Well you can move her.
1 : But I-
3 : But I can-
4 : She can move her
1 : Oh yeah.
3 : I can move like you and then you can go
1 : Move her though, cause I, like I have the moves to get there, so.
2 : Yeah, cause she's the farthest away.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : And now pick up your t-
4 : Oh
3 : Oh
2 : Mm
3 : Ok
1 : You have to discard

3 : Um
2 : Discard anything.
1 : Well yeah
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Copper Gate,
3 : Temple and the s- Temple of the Sun.
4 : Alright

2 : Ok
1 : You s-
4 : Or, well I'll shore up this.
1 : Yeah
4 : Tidal Palace,
4 : Dunes of Deception,
4 : and Misty Marsh.
1 : I guess I could just do
1 : one, two, and then
1 : this, right?
2 : Yeah
4 : Yay
1 : Yay

3 : Alright
2 : K
2 : let's go.
3 : Take it away Engineer
1 : Ok
1 : so
1 : first I can take up to three actions.
1 : Um does anybody have any suggestions?
1 : I was thinking of like
1 : maybe moving and then
1 : shoring up two tiles
2 : Ok
3 : That sounds good
1 : That works, ok
2 : That sounds fine with me.
3 : Yeah
1 : So this is one action
2 : Mmhmm
3 : What other cards do you have?
3 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : I'll shore up
1 : this one
1 : and
1 : this one, I guess
3 : Sounds good
1 : So that's my second action
2 : Ok
1 : And then for my third action
1 : Um
1 : I guess I can move again
3 : Yeah
1 : Or
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : I'll move
1 : here.
2 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : draw two treasure deck cards
1 : So I got these. Water's Rise, so I guess I have to play that now.
3 : Mm
2 : Oh no
1 : Um move this up one.
2 : Ok
1 : Shuffle the flood discard pile. We don't
1 : Are these
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : So
1 : shuffling
3 : Take up to
3 : Did she not take three actions?
1 : Oh
1 : I took three
3 : She moved twice and shored one up.
2 : Yeah
1 : But that's my power
1 : Ok
1 : um so shuffling the flood discard pile.
1 : Place it on top of the flood
1 : draw pile.
1 : and then discard this card to the treasure discard pile.
1 : K
2 : Alright
3 : Alright Messenger
2 : Cool
1 : Cool
2 : Alright
2 : my turn.
2 : Um
2 : so what I think I'm going to
2 : do
2 : I'm just going to move
2 : down one
2 : Um
2 : I'm not allowed to shore up anything adjacent
2 : correct or I can do adjacent?
1 : I think you
1 : ha-
1 : mm
3 : Um
1 : Any adjacent tile
3 : Yeah
1 : you can do one.
2 : Ok, so then I can't do that one.
3 : So you could do Cities of Abandon
1 : No
3 : No but you can do this one
2 : That's diagonal.
2 : Ok alright
3 : if you wanted to
2 : Let me do the Cliffs of Abandon then
3 : K
1 : That's your second
1 : turn.
2 : That's my second move.
2 : Any suggestions for a third move?
3 : Um for your third move
1 : Not really
2 : So I guess
3 : You could head over to the fire one
3 : and then over
2 : Yeah
3 : to the Cave of Shadows and then
2 : Yeah, ok
2 : so I'll move
3 : Oh wait I thought you were the red guy, never mind.
2 : No I'll move to the Breaker's Bridge
3 : Ok
2 : (--)
2 : So then I'll draw two cards
2 : Then I'll draw two here.
2 : So that means that
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : That one, yeah
2 : yeah,
2 : alright.
2 : Now this is flooded.
2 : And then Phantom Rock
3 : Oops, that one is sunk.

3 : Alright
2 : Ok
3 : Cool, so you're done. Alright.

2 : Ok
1 : That's alright
3 : Ok
2 : It's ok
2 : We're still in this
1 : Eh
3 : Alright so
3 : I guess I'll start by giving you this
1 : I'll discard
1 : this one.
3 : Yeah
1 : Put it in the discard pile, ok.
3 : Ok so then you're set to do that
3 : and
1 : So that was one action?
3 : It was one action
3 : um
3 : We have three of these earth
3 : cards on the board.
3 : So I could
2 : Ok
3 : head over here
2 : Ok
2 : and then
1 : That sounds good.
3 : Ok
2 : And then I can give you
1 : So that's three.
3 : Yeah
2 : K
2 : so draw two treasure cards
3 : sandbags
3 : and another lion.
2 : Alright and then three flood cards
3 : Alright, the Iron Gate
3 : Cities of Abandon,
3 : and the Whispering Garden.
2 : K
2 : Mmhmm
3 : K
2 : We're good.
1 : Ok, so now it's my turn.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok so
1 : I can get
1 : this one
2 : K awesome
1 : So I think that counts as a turn
2 : First treasure
3 : Woo
1 : Or like as an action
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : I don't know where that goes, but
3 : Does that go here?
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so that's one
3 : Yay
2 : Alright
1 : Um
2 : Sweet
1 : I'm this one so
1 : I could
1 : move
1 : here
1 : for two actions and then later I could shore these up
1 : if they're still flooded.
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : So
1 : one, two
2 : Alright
2 : cool.
2 : Alright
2 : so
1 : Oh and I have to draw a card

1 : three of these
1 : Copper Gate, Crimson Forest, and Temple of the Sun.
2 : K
2 : very cool.
3 : We're getting flooded
2 : Oh no, alright
2 : so
2 : I think I'd like to give one of my
2 : cards, I mean
2 : Do you think that'll be necessary right now or no?
3 : Um so I'm on the earth on so ideally I'd like to collect those.
3 : Um
1 : So you would give it to her
2 : Ok so
2 : um is there a card that you're like willing to get rid of?
3 : Uh
3 : we have four lions
1 : You can get rid of the sandbags
3 : on the table right now.
3 : Ok
2 : I mean you could- what
3 : Well should I get rid of the sandbags if we have this many flooded tiles
3 : at the moment?
2 : I would
2 : Yeah I wouldn't do that
1 : Maybe you should keep that
3 : I can get rid of one Helicopter Lift
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : and then I'll take an earth card
2 : Alright
2 : so then I'll give you the earth card
2 : and then what I wanna do is
2 : maybe shore up this one/
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So that's

2 : Ok
1 : Cool
2 : That was a bummer
2 : I can use my sandbag
2 : I can play this at any time I want
3 : Well you know what we could do,
3 : just looking at the board
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : So all four treasures are in this area
2 : Mmhmm
3 : as is Fool's Landing so we could just focus all of our efforts right in here
2 : Mmhmm
1 : But then if one of these gets sunk then we're screwed.
3 : True
3 : But it's such a tight area that we'd be so mobile
1 : Yeah we could like focus on here but then like if one of them- One of these get sunk it's no big deal.
2 : Mm
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah ok
2 : Ok I mean
2 : I'm gonna keep my sandbag card, it's like

2 : So yeah this does not count as an action
1 : So you have
1 : two more
3 : Two more ok um
3 : What could I do?

2 : once I use the sandbag.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um what do you guys suggest that I do?
3 : Um
2 : you know what maybe I should
2 : move to Cave of Shadows
3 : Ok
2 : and like shore up these because
2 : I don't- Wait
1 : You can only
2 : You can, you can fly anywhere
2 : like people anywhere
2 : right?
3 : Um only with the Helicopter card
2 : Ok, alright
2 : so
2 : I don't want people to get trapped if that floods so
2 : we're gonna move one here
2 : and we're gonna shore up that.
2 : Sound good?

3 : Sounds good
2 : Ok cool
2 : So two treasure

1 : The Dunes of Deception and the Silver Gate
2 : Dunes of Deception
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok.
1 : K
2 : Alright
2 : cool.
3 : Alright
3 : so I will start by
3 : flying to the Temple of the Sun
3 : and
3 : buying that
3 : treasure
2 : Alright
1 : Wow we already got two
3 : Yeah
3 : I'm in line to get three
3 : um
3 : so now that we have that that's two actions, I have one more action
3 : which would be
3 : So we need to get over to
3 : the Cave of Embers or the Cave of Shadows
1 : Yeah
3 : How can I
3 : help you get there?
1 : You could use the Helicopter
1 : if you wanted to use it or
1 : you could save it
3 : I kinda wanna save it just because we're so close
1 : Yeah
1 : Um
1 : I mean I can get there on my own because
1 : um I'm here so in my next turn I can do one, two,
1 : three, and then on
1 : like wait-
1 : Unless this gets flooded
2 : I think, I think what you should do is like one, two, and then shore that up
1 : Shore it- Yeah ok, we'll do that. So I think you can just
2 : Yeah
1 : like, you don't have to do anything else.
3 : Ok
2 : But
2 : she does have to take
2 : Oh she could- Ok alright yeah.
1 : You don't have to
3 : Ok
3 : um
3 : so that's that
2 : Oh god
3 : Ok the Howling Garden,
3 : I assume you wanna swim here?
1 : Wait this is the Whispering Garden
3 : Oh that's the Whispering Garden
3 : oh the Howling Garden
2 : Ok (--)
3 : It's no big deal
3 : The Cave of Embers
3 : and the Bronze Gate
2 : There
3 : Ok
3 : So that wasn't so bad
2 : Ok
1 : Ok now it's my turn
1 : So I'm gonna
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
1 : move
1 : one,
1 : two
2 : And shore that one up
1 : and then
1 : yeah, shore this up,
1 : three.
1 : Ok
2 : K
2 : Alright
1 : And then I take two of those
2 : I really don't hope it's- Aw
1 : Oh but I have to discard something
1 : Well
3 : Not yet
1 : Not yet
1 : I'll have to discard
1 : the Helicopter, or
1 : I'll keep the Helicopter and discard this.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : And then Water's Rise
1 : Though, we're still at three which is ok.
1 : Um shuffle
1 : this,
1 : place it here,
1 : and then this goes there.
1 : So one, two,
1 : three.
1 : Tidal Palace
1 : is gone
2 : That's ok we still have a (tile)
3 : As is the Whispering Garden
1 : Cities of Abandon is
1 : this- Oh right yeah ok
3 : Oh that's still there
2 : Ok
2 : alright
2 : cool.
2 : So in terms of move recommendations for me
2 : um
2 : should I just shore up the surrounding area?
3 : What you could do would be to shore up those two and then get yourself to Fool's Landing.
2 : Ok, I think that's a really good call.
2 : Alright
1 : Yeah
2 : so
2 : one,
2 : two,
2 : alright.
2 : And then I'm gonna draw two treasure cards
2 : So earth
2 : and this, and then I gotta discard
2 : Do you guys have any recommendations for what I should discard?
1 : You could discard this cause we already have one.
2 : Ok
2 : Oh, one and then one more.
1 : The fi-
3 : The earth cards
2 : The, the-
2 : This one.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah that doesn't matter
2 : Ok
2 : alright.
2 : So that's
2 : that, alright.

2 : two,
2 : three
2 : alright.
2 : So
2 : Cave of Shadows is flooded,

2 : is flooded,
2 : and then the Bronze Gate
1 : It's gone.
2 : Alright
2 : K
3 : ok doke.
3 : Um so what has to happen this last round is you have to get here, do that, and then go there and then we'll be good.
1 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : is there anything that I need to do other than get to Fool's Landing?
1 : S
1 : I don't think so.
2 : Get to Fool's Landing and just shore up that, I guess
1 : You could fly here, shore this up, and then move here.
1 : Yeah
2 : K
3 : Alright
3 : sandbags.
2 : (--)
2 : Cool
1 : Ok so
3 : Uh oh hold on

2 : Yeah
3 : The Silver Gate

2 : K
2 : Alright
1 : Ok

3 : Fool's Landing doesn't get flooded.
2 : Yeah, I guess, um
1 : Yeah, you don't really have to do anything.
2 : Alright, ok, so I'm just gonna take two.
2 : Oh k
1 : Darn
2 : Alright ok
1 : That's alright cause Fool's Landing's not in there
1 : Oh
3 : Yeah
3 : Fool's Landing's somewhere

3 : two of the fire ones.
1 : I got two of the fire
3 : Ok, so maybe move
1 : So no one has that
3 : towards one of the fire things.

1 : I'll just chill there.
1 : Yeah, alright
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Should I like
1 : (--) two of those
3 : Wait does it- So your thing, you can shore up two at once?
1 : Nnhmm
3 : That means you only used one turn right?
1 : I used one and then two.
1 : And I guess I could do this one, three.
3 : Ok then, cool
1 : Uh
2 : Good
2 : Cool
1 : (Alright)
1 : Water's Rise, great
1 : Uh, this one
2 : So

2 : Up, down, doesn't matter, right?
1 : Yeah, it doesn't
2 : Ok
1 : Alright
2 : My turn
1 : Yep
2 : Um
2 : it doesn't matter who has-
2 : Well
2 : Oh
1 : Oh we have to do that still, whoops
3 : Are flood cards equal to the water level, oh yeah
1 : Alright, Gold Gate, Breaker's Bridge, oh thank God.
1 : Uh
3 : (Which one?)
2 : Gold
1 : Uh, that's gone.
3 : Gold Gate, oh, ok

3 : Gold Gate,
3 : goodbye
2 : Ok
2 : Your turn's over right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yes
2 : Ok
2 : Um
3 : Uh
2 : So
3 : I guess we should
3 : figure out which uh,
3 : which ones (we're) going for.
2 : So, what I can do is, I can give mine to her but then she already has
1 : Has that one
2 : four cards.
3 : Yeah, she would have to discard if she got to five.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ga- Does your thing let you take stuff from her too?
1 : W-
1 : wait
2 : No
1 : I don't think this one counts as one, right?
2 : No, I mean you have three
3 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : Oh, ok
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Uh
2 : That's not particularly necessary
2 : I think
2 : what I'd like to do
1 : I mean, I think I just give it to you next turn
2 : Ok, we can, we can do that.
1 : I mean
2 : What I like to do is make sure that, I mean
2 : a goal we should have is to make sure we have, we keep tiles on the island, up
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um, so I'm gonna move and then flip these two, and it'll be
2 : three actions.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, yeah.
3 : Mm
2 : One,
2 : two,
2 : three.
2 : Take two of these
2 : Uh, so I have
2 : that.
1 : Two
2 : What's next?
2 : Two of these?
1 : Yeah
1 : Wait, yeah, two.
1 : Oh my god
2 : Ok
2 : Uh
2 : Whispering Garden,
2 : Phantom Rock.
3 : Oh
3 : Phantom Rock's gone.
2 : K
3 : And then, pass me the Phantom Rock card.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok,
2 : is that it?
3 : Cool, yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright
3 : Alright, so
1 : Um
1 : Pilot
3 : Whispering Garden, ok, so
3 : What color am I, blue?
1 : Yeah
3 : So, let's see, should I go to Whispering Garden and shore it up then?
2 : Yeah
1 : I mean
2 : Um
2 : or I can fly someone somewhere, right?
3 : I can- Well I can use the Lift to move someone somewhere, but
1 : He can fly somewhere.
1 : I would keep it for now.
3 : Yeah maybe we'll hold onto it for now. I can fly myself anywhere for one action.
2 : (Uh) oh
2 : I see
2 : um
2 : yeah, I think that's fair.
3 : Then I'm thinking, yeah, go here, shore up, and then
1 : Yeah, you can
2 : (You gotta)
3 : And then, I have one more
3 : Mm
2 : Do you have one more, or two more?
1 : (--)
2 : Is that one?
3 : I have one more, right? Cause going there was one action and then shoring up was one action.
2 : Got you
1 : Oh yeah
3 : And then, let's see,
3 : anyone close to doing anything hmm?
2 : You don't have to take three actions.
3 : Yeah, that's true.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, uh
1 : Ok,
1 : guess we're good.
3 : Unless there's anything you can think of that I should do, but
3 : Mm
3 : Ok
1 : Mm
1 : everything's pretty good, alright
2 : Ok
3 : And then I'll get two of these
3 : Sweet, another Lift.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : And then
1 : Oh alright
2 : two of these, right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh yeah,
3 : two of these.
3 : So, Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Alright,
1 : well,
1 : I guess first I'll do this one.
1 : Wait, let me think this through.
2 : Yeah
1 : Do I wanna do that?
3 : Lost Lagoon, do we need Lost Lagoon for anything?
1 : Hmm
1 : It's just there
2 : No
2 : Not really
3 : Yeah, it's kinda on the edge too, so,
3 : it's not as important.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : One thing, like, if you can make it over to me so I can give you this,
3 : so then you'd have three
3 : of the fire ones
3 : at some point.
1 : Ok, so I can do
2 : You could do that, so you could do one,
2 : two,
2 : shore,
3 : And then shore up and then on my tu-
2 : so then make it-
2 : I mean, and then
3 : Wait on
1 : Oh yeah, and then I could go over there.
3 : yeah, on my turn I can give stuff right?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, ok
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright, one,
1 : two, and shore that up.
1 : That makes sense.
1 : Alright
2 : Two for you
1 : Oh look at that
2 : Oh
2 : Oh man
3 : Nice
1 : That one
1 : No we can't switch, never mind.
2 : And two of these for you
3 : One, two, three, four, five
1 : (Yes)
1 : Iron Gate,
1 : and Temple of the Moon
3 : Iron Gate
2 : Iron Gate
1 : Temple of the Moon
2 : This Temple of the Sun
3 : No, Temple of the Moon, this guy
1 : Oh, whoops
1 : There we go
2 : That's silly
2 : I don't know why they did that, ok
2 : Good
1 : Good
2 : Good
3 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : three actions
2 : I don't wanna give
2 : mine to any of you
2 : But you
2 : Uh
2 : but on your next turns you can give it to me if you want
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Maybe I'll try to make my way toward one of these.
2 : There's two of them?
3 : Yeah, the
3 : one at the top and the one at the bottom.
2 : Oh, so it doesn't really matter.
3 : And that one's flooded.
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna go the other way.
2 : Um, so that's one,
2 : two,
2 : this is a bad idea guys, three.
1 : Mm
3 : I don't know. Well I do have Helicopter Lift, but
2 : That's ok,
2 : you can keep it
3 : Yeah
3 : ok.
2 : for now.
1 : That's
2 : Ok
1 : As long as it's not flooded, it's fine.
2 : Ok so we have a Water's Rise,
1 : Alright,
1 : there's this.
2 : (--)
2 : Move it up
2 : Um
2 : shuffle
1 : Shuffle that.
2 : Put it back on top
2 : Mm, discard?
1 : Yeah
2 : Is that right?
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok, and then I have to take two of these?
1 : Three.
3 : Three now
2 : Shit
2 : Sorry that's some,
2 : sorry.
2 : Um
1 : Oh on
2 : ok so Temple of the Moon is gone.
3 : Ok
2 : Lost Lagoon,
2 : Lost Lagoon is gone.
1 : That's gone.
2 : So do you have a (--)
1 : Then Cliffs
2 : Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : Alright
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Ok
2 : And that is my turn.
3 : Alright
3 : cool
2 : K
3 : So, on my turn, first I'll give this to you.
2 : Two, three, four, five
1 : Alright
3 : That's one
1 : Oh wait
2 : That-
2 : She has five cards then.
3 : Yeah, that just means you have to discard one right?
2 : (Yeah)
1 : Oh
2 : get rid of
1 : This?
1 : This one
2 : Get rid of the blue one
1 : Oh
1 : yeah cause then we'll have three right?
2 : Cause then we can give
3 : Ok, yeah, that makes sense.
2 : try and get ours.
1 : Ok
1 : Four
3 : Um, yeah, ok
3 : And then I have
3 : two more things I can do. What should I do? Should I shore up Cliffs of Abandon?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yes please.
3 : Ok
1 : That's the only way I'm getting over there
3 : Ok
3 : so that's two actions,
3 : and then
3 : what else can I do?
3 : Um
3 : Should probably stay put right?
3 : So on- When it's your turn you can give me that gold one.
1 : Give you that and then I could do one two,
3 : So yeah, we'll be on
2 : Yeah
1 : make my way over
3 : to the, yeah, Cave of Embers.
2 : Ok,
2 : I'm ok with that.
3 : So, ok, do you need to go anywhere? I can lift you.
3 : I got so many Helicopters.
2 : Uh
1 : I mean if you wanna lift me to the fire one.
3 : Yeah, the problem is you have to give me your thing too,
3 : you know?
3 : So we have to be on the same square
1 : Oh
3 : Or I could lift us both- Yeah, yeah, ok, why don't I do that?
2 : You could,
2 : you could,
2 : Yeah, and then
1 : Ok, we can both go
3 : I'll lift us both to the Cave of Embers
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Ok and that's three for my turn.
1 : Perfect
2 : And then
3 : Oh wait, this doesn't count as an action.
2 : So
1 : So then
2 : did you pick your cards?
3 : No, I mean I have one more, right?
1 : (If) you want to
2 : One more action?
3 : Do I need to do anything?
1 : Mm
3 : No ok
1 : Cause I mean you can't really move off
3 : Yeah, ok
3 : So I got this and I got some sandbags
3 : and then
1 : Alright
2 : Three of these
3 : So we got Whispering Garden,
3 : Iron Gate,
3 : and Iron Gate's gone,
3 : and
3 : uh Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Alright
2 : Cool
1 : So
1 : guess first I'll
1 : take this one
1 : and then I'll give this to you
3 : Thank you
1 : And good thing I'm on the other side of the board.
1 : I guess I'll start moving over.
1 : I'm red.
3 : Ok
1 : And then, this is discard right?
2 : (--)
2 : Two for you
1 : Alright
1 : (then)
1 : three
2 : Oh man, the stress
3 : I know
1 : Howling Garden, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate
2 : Howling Garden,
3 : Howling Garden, ok
1 : then
3 : Copper Gate,
2 : And Crimson Forest's right above it.
3 : t
3 : Crimson Forest
1 : Crimson Forest
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Now the two little lion ones are
3 : flooded.
1 : Oh jeez
3 : So
3 : but I mean, you have a sandbag, I have a sandbag.
1 : Well,
1 : next turn.
2 : (--)
1 : Oh yeah
3 : We can
2 : Does not count as an action
2 : Um, so
3 : For the sandbags, yeah
2 : Yeah, so
2 : I'm gonna
2 : save one of these,
2 : just in case
3 : Ok
2 : Um, cause then, if we lose
3 : Yeah, we don't wanna, we don't wanna lose both of them.
2 : one or both of them then we can't
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so that's one
2 : um
3 : Or that's not an action, yeah.
2 : Oh, that's zero
1 : Maybe like make your way over
1 : save
1 : something, I don't know.
2 : Save something.
3 : Save something
3 : Um
2 : I mean, I can move, one, two,
2 : shore this up.
3 : Yeah
2 : Is that what we wanna do?
3 : Well you can give me the
2 : Oh I can give you a treasure, that's good
3 : gold one, and I also wanna, I also wanna give you this.
1 : Oh yeah,
2 : Ok
1 : yeah I'll give you
3 : So
1 : I guess I could give you both of these.
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna give that to you.
1 : (If you want)
3 : Ok
2 : So that's
2 : one,
3 : So I guess we need to be like on the same space, but I could just fly to your space, wherever you end up.
1 : So that's one
3 : Maybe you should just go to Temple of the Sun?
2 : Just wait?
3 : Yeah
1 : That means coming
3 : Cause
2 : I can, I mean
1 : No because he'll give it to you, and then I'll give mine to you, and then you'll have four.
2 : Ok
2 : Well then I can always do that on one turn, should I shore this one up? It doesn't matter I guess
2 : I'll just go here
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok, yeah
2 : (--)
1 : Oh jeez
2 : Alright
3 : Oh
2 : Water's Rise
2 : move the
2 : Shuffle
2 : Copper Gate,
2 : so we need to keep
2 : the,
2 : the gol- the sh- the,
3 : Which one?
2 : the windy lion one.
1 : Yeah
2 : What is the windy lion one?
3 : yeah
1 : Try to
3 : Yeah
2 : Because both of these are in here now, on the top.
3 : Right
2 : And then, discard
2 : ok.
1 : Alright
2 : Pilot
3 : Ok,
3 : ok, wait did you already get the-
2 : Yes.
1 : Oh yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Yes, yes
1 : Yeah
3 : (--) ok, alright
1 : Alright, so
3 : Um
1 : the globe thing right?
2 : No
2 : Shoot
1 : But didn't we do that? Oh
2 : No
1 : I thought we did
3 : Are you trying to get away with?
2 : Copper- Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Goodbye Breaker's Bridge
3 : Breaker's Bridge is gone, k
2 : Copper Gate,
3 : Copper Gate's gone.
2 : Also gone.
2 : Crimson Forest
3 : Alright, cool.
2 : Alright
3 : Who cares about those places?
1 : At least they're like on the edge.
2 : We don't need em
2 : Yeah
2 : which is good.
3 : Ok
1 : (--)
3 : Um, so this is still good
3 : so I'm, ok
1 : (--)
1 : (Glo)
3 : That
1 : b
2 : One, two, three, four, you have too many cards
3 : You may only have five.
3 : Wait- One, two, three
3 : Me?
2 : Wait
2 : Yes
1 : Oh yeah
3 : (--)
3 : Oh, I do, yeah so I have to discard.
1 : (--)
1 : (--)
3 : Um, can't discard this, can't discard this.
1 : I'd just say sandbag
3 : Um
2 : Just, yeah
3 : Ok, sandbag is gone.
2 : That's fine
3 : Alright
3 : so, let's see
1 : Glo- Oh cause you're not on the same thing
3 : Yeah
3 : Do you think there's gonna be an-
1 : I guess you could fly over and give it to her
3 : That's what I was gonna do yeah, that would be two actions,
3 : and then I could Lift you over too.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Eh ok, so we'll just count on the fact that there's another Lift card
3 : at the end, right?
1 : I'm sure there's more than two
3 : Ok
2 : Unless there's none
3 : I'll fly over, so that's one,
3 : give you this, that's two,
2 : Thank you
3 : and then
3 : Helicopter Lift you over here,
3 : so then on your turn you'll give her that. And then I'll have one more
1 : Alright
3 : action. I guess I'll just go
3 : this way.
2 : Ok
3 : ok
2 : And then
1 : Alright
2 : pick two of these
3 : Oh that's right. Nah
2 : and three of these.
3 : Sweet
3 : And cool, Lift
2 : Great
1 : Oh perfect
3 : Eh, Whispering Garden,
3 : oh it's gone, that's fine.
1 : Oh, there's the other
3 : Oh Howling Garden and Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Good God
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Uh
3 : So Whispering Garden's gone
1 : Whispering Garden
2 : Ok
2 : So, we have to make sure
2 : this is safe
3 : Yeah
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
2 : Hmm
2 : Ok
2 : your turn.
1 : Alright so I'll,
1 : I'll give you just this one for now,
2 : Thanks
1 : and then
1 : I'm gonna make my way over to here, to try to flip that next turn.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Sound good?
3 : Uh huh
1 : Three
3 : And here's
1 : Yup
3 : Two for you
1 : Oh look at that, what luck
2 : Grand
3 : Oh nice
1 : (Three)
1 : Cave of Embers,
1 : Silver Gate,
3 : This guy
1 : and Dunes of Deception.
3 : Silver Gate
2 : Shoot
3 : Oh god
2 : I'm just gonna get rid of that
3 : Yeah, we already have that one.
2 : Ok,
2 : is that it?
1 : Yup
2 : Ok
2 : Um, so I'm on this, I'm gonna
2 : for one action trade this-
2 : They could've done a better job making that purple.
2 : So that's one
3 : Mmhmm
1 : (He) gives-
1 : Oh no you can't anymore-
1 : I was gonna say cause we're not on the same thing.
2 : It doesn't matter.
3 : Oh, but she's special, she's special, yeah.
1 : Oh yeah cause you're messenger.
2 : I'm special
1 : Perfect.
2 : So that's two
2 : and then
2 : I'm gonna move off of this
3 : Yeah
2 : and get three.
3 : Cool
2 : I'm gonna take two of these
2 : and then three of these.
3 : It's gonna be a
3 : Water Rise's
2 : Tidal Place,
3 : Nope.
3 : Tidal (--)
2 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Coral Palace.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Oh God
3 : So
3 : let's see, (--)
1 : So you flip Coral Palace,
2 : (because) she needs that one.
3 : But if we, if we just get this, we only need three of them right?
1 : Oh yeah, we only need three.
3 : Cause I could just go here, one, flip it- Or do I need to flip it to get the treasure?
1 : Oh yeah cause-
2 : I don't think so.
3 : Ok
3 : just go here, get the treasure, and then
1 : We're done.
3 : and then we can start heading to um
3 : yeah, Fool's Landing.
1 : Perfect
2 : Ok
3 : What color am I, blue?
1 : Yeah
3 : So fly myself here,
3 : turn these in,
3 : get that,
3 : and then
1 : start making your way over.
3 : Yeah, just go back this way.
2 : Ok
3 : And now everyone just has to get
2 : But you have to pick two more of those
3 : back to-
3 : Yeah, so as long as Fool's Landing doesn't flood.
2 : Which we haven't-
1 : It can flood though,
1 : we're fine if it floods.
3 : Oh yeah that's true, huh
2 : Here you go
3 : Ok
3 : Um, Watchtower, Misty Marsh,
3 : and Temple of the Sun.
3 : And that's this.
1 : So um
3 : And Watchtower.
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
2 : We're ok
3 : We're good
1 : Alright
1 : Then I'll just
3 : We're swimming
1 : move one over.
1 : onto that.
1 : Next
2 : (--)
1 : Oh right, that's right.
2 : Those are your two.
1 : Two. Oh look at that,
1 : another Lift, Water's Rise.
2 : Ok
1 : Move that
3 : oh you could've used one of your turns to shore up these two, just in case,
3 : whoever that is drowns, you know?
1 : Because if it, if it goes down then they can just move over one, right?
3 : And that like they can't, they can't move back
3 : Yeah, this one can, but this guy, whoever's there can't, you know?
2 : But I can't.
1 : Oh if both of those
1 : we can lift them
3 : Yeah, that's true that's true
1 : We both have one
1 : We're good, sorry, my bad
3 : It's all good.
1 : (and three)
1 : Tidal Palace,
3 : Gone.
1 : Cave of Embers,
3 : Gone.
1 : and Howling Garden.
3 : Gone.
1 : Alright
2 : (--) go.
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : so I just have to make it to Fool's Landing,
1 : Yeah
2 : correct?
3 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : one,
2 : two, I'm gonna shore this up for you,
3 : Oh, thanks.
2 : three.
3 : Alright.
3 : And then my turn, oh yeah, this stuff too.
1 : And the cards
2 : Oh, ok
2 : One, two, three
2 : Dunes of Deception,
2 : Silver Gate,
2 : Temple of the Sun.
2 : There you go
3 : Ok
3 : Ok, and
3 : one, and Helicopter Lift
3 : and that's it.
1 : Woo
3 : Alright
1 : Yup
2 : Is that it?
3 : Yeah
1 : We're good

1 : Guys, you're gonna have to help coach me.
3 : Ok
1 : K.
4 : Mmkay.
1 : K, so I can move anywhere
4 : So, you are up first.
4 : Yeah, so your power is to shore stuff up.
1 : Right.
4 : So I wouldn't really worry with the Lost Lagoon, cause I don't think we're gonna go out that direction much anyways, so I don't really care if we lose that tile, right?
1 : Ok
1 : So go here.
2 : Maybe you could
3 : Yeah, yeah.
4 : Yeah, so I think that's probably your best bet.
1 : And then I wanna shore up these two.
4 : Yeah, I'd agree.
4 : And then you have one more action, you could- Let's see, so you have the two chalices and who's over here, who's gray, you? That's the messenger. Um
1 : (Making a mess)
1 : So would I wanna go with her?
4 : Eh, it doesn't really matter cause none of us have the Helicopter card and we're just trying
4 : move around. Your best bet might be
1 : But she can give me a card though. No it doesn't matter. Ok, it doesn't matter.
2 : You could, you could
4 : She has nothing to give you yet, yeah, you might pull the card you want. You should probably move to Breaker's Bridge in like, just in case, so that if it does get
3 : Oh
1 : Ok
4 : flooded. And then so you have to draw
4 : two treasure cards
4 : and hopefully not a Flood Rise's this early.
1 : Ok
4 : Yup.
1 : Mm
1 : Ok, great.
2 : Figures.
1 : So I have to do this
4 : yeah
2 : Shuffle these,
2 : I think.
4 : Oh yeah weren't we supposed to start with Forbidden Island, uh
1 : What?
4 : Cards already thrown away, or is that the
2 : These were the ones that were discarded.
4 : Yeah, ok we're still (ok, didn't know), oh yeah, the (--), alright that makes sense.
1 : Ok
1 : So I just take two
4 : Oh that is really sadistic.
3 : Mm
1 : K
1 : and then Breaker's Bridge. So it's
4 : So yeah you're gonna have to swim.
1 : So now what?
1 : So I have to - discard this.
4 : Yeah you can choose any of the, yeah, any of the adjacent tiles.
4 : Yes so these go
1 : And move anywhere.
4 : You p-
4 : Probably, that's probably better than
1 : K
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
4 : getting them lost
4 : That's this one.
3 : Where was it?
1 : Where's that one? So I have to flood that one?
4 : Yup
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
4 : Cool.
1 : And then
4 : So this one's out of the game, that's not too bad
1 : get rid of this,
1 : these both
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah, no just those, just that one. And we uh we moved the- and we already moved the Water's Rise up. Ok. So it's one turn.
2 : This one, this one comes over here.
1 : Just this one, ok. Cause I can hold five.
2 : And uh, yeah.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : ALright
2 : So
4 : Let's see, where's Messenger? You're over here.
2 : No for me.
4 : Um
2 : Well I can
2 : I can move
4 : Yeah
2 : and I could
4 : You could shore up that one, yeah.
2 : shore this guy up here.
4 : And then
4 : that would be a good idea.
2 : One,
2 : who's-
2 : There's two moves
4 : Two moves
2 : What else?
4 : And then I could
2 : I could
4 : take your, we could- I could take your, your statue, or I could give it to you either way. Oh I'm trying to remember if your special move
2 : This doesn't count as a f-, as a
4 : counts
3 : Mm
2 : sp- I don't know, does it, does it count as um
4 : as a move.
4 : I'm trying think, I'm trying remember if it
4 : does.
1 : Look on the back of your Messenger thing.
4 : Let's see
1 : Does it say on there?
2 : Uh
4 : Engineer can shore- Messenger can give a single card per action- Oh yeah, so yeah.
2 : yeah.
4 : So it does count as an action.
4 : So you can give that to me at any time, let's just wait and see, let's see who gets the more of the Earth statue cards.
2 : Alright.
2 : Alright, so then I have to pull two of these.
4 : Well yeah, well you have to make your third action I think.
2 : You can do up to three.
4 : Oh up to three, yeah.
3 : Oh ok.
2 : So do you think I'm good?
1 : Oh you don't have to do three?
2 : You can do up to three.
4 : Let's see, that's a good question. Yeah, choose, well it says choose three, uh oh yeah
2 : Right here.
1 : Take up to three actions.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh yeah, you're right. Ok cool.
3 : Oh ok.
2 : So I think I'm good, you guys think so?
4 : Yeah, sweet.
4 : Um
2 : So I can take
2 : two?
4 : Yeah, probably.
1 : So don't take it if it's gonna hurt you.
4 : Yeah, honestly it does if you can't think of anything to do. You
2 : I've got
4 : Oh yeah, so no, you've got the Earth statue, ok.
2 : this dude
2 : and sandbags.
4 : Perfect, so save the sandbags for now
2 : Alright.
2 : And
4 : till we get
2 : now I've gotta
4 : well
3 : Well no,
3 : Cause we didn't-
4 : Yeah let's see, let's see, what could get flooded again? Cause we got Lost Lagoon, we don't really
3 : Ok, yeah.
4 : Any of these could get lost, they're not really important, they're all on the edge, so we should save the sandbags.
4 : So yeah
2 : Well I think, I think we can just
2 : not do anything with this, I have to take
4 : Yeah
2 : the three cards now though.
4 : Yeah, I was just, yeah. If you, you could- Well the thing is, yeah the thing is you can use the sandbags before you draw them but like I was just considering like we don't need to cause if we
1 : Two,
1 : just two.
2 : Oh two, two.
4 : lose any of those,
2 : Yeah, they're kind of on the outer edges at this point too, so we're probably
4 : yeah, they don't matter.
4 : But yeah, but once you draw them you can't use sandbags.
2 : Pretty good
4 : So yeah let's see what they
2 : Ok
2 : I've got Temple of the Moon and the Gold Gate.
2 : Uh
3 : That's gone.
4 : Ok
2 : Gold Gate's outta here.
4 : Yeah, so that's fine.
3 : Yeah.
1 : K
2 : And you flipped Temple of the Moon?
4 : Yes.
1 : Mmhmm.
4 : Sweet.
4 : Ok
3 : Ok, now my turn.
4 : Looks like you're up.
4 : So Pilot can go anywhere.
3 : Uh, I can go anywhere.
3 : What I could do is go here
3 : and flip that over.
4 : You- let's see
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah, that's probably a good idea or
3 : Or
4 : Cause we ca-, we don't really wanna lose Temple of the Moon.
3 : Yeah
4 : But I'm gonna be pretty close to that too. I'm gonna be pretty close to that too, so what I was thinking about doing, I was thinking about
2 : Cause it has, it has the,
2 : it has the stone on here.
3 : yeah
4 : moving that way anyways.
4 : Um
4 : but it's gonna, cause of the Flood Rises thing
4 : Well as long as, as long as we don't get the other Flood Rises's cards we should be ok.
3 : Ok, so
4 : So what- yeah, just go for it.
4 : Why not?
3 : But uh, that's two actions
3 : and I'll leave it
2 : Yeah
4 : And then
3 : or no?
4 : Ok
4 : Is anyone getting close to five cards, yeah you've got four so that's ok,
4 : but let's see
3 : I mean I could go onto her
3 : tile, so on the next move if you get over cumbered
3 : you can give me one.
4 : Yeah, let's do that.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : But, but she doesn't have to cause it's the Messenger too, which is the funny part, but you can do two actions if you yeah, give one to
3 : You're messenger?
3 : Yeah
2 : Alright
3 : Just in case
4 : Ok
2 : So two cards
4 : So then let's see
3 : (And then two)
4 : See if we develop anymore
3 : Helicopter
3 : and a chalice.
4 : Chalice, ok.
2 : Lots of Helicopters
3 : Yeah
4 : So where are you in relation to him?
4 : If we can get that chalice over, ok.
1 : Red
4 : So that's not too far. Well I probably we can just kinda drop it at anytime.
3 : Ok
4 : So
4 : Oh and you have to pull the Flood cards for it
3 : And
3 : well we do reshuffle
4 : Before I can go
4 : No, cause it wasn't the Water Rises.
2 : No, that's only with the Water's Rises.
3 : Don't we- No, ok.
4 : Hopefully
4 : which
3 : Lost Lagoon,
3 : and Phantom Rock.
2 : Ok
3 : So,
1 : Lost Lagoon's
2 : Phantom-
1 : gone.
2 : Oh man!
3 : Rock gone.
4 : That's (so yeah (--))
3 : We're sinking
2 : We're losing our island.
4 : These are ok, ok losses though. You just wanna protect the ones that are on the inside.
3 : Lost Lagoon,
1 : Now like why didn't you use that one of the Helicopter cards, cause we only need one?
2 : Did
4 : Yeah, well
3 : Oh
1 : Like why didn't you use one?
1 : Can you still?
3 : Oh
4 : Hmm, you can use one anytime, that's the thing, you can move any of these guys
1 : Oh, it's not an action?
1 : So like
4 : Yeah, so we should
1 : can't you, he use one of those?
3 : So I could use it right now if I wanted to.
4 : Well I'd save it, I'd save like let's wait till we have a few more cards like that are like if we have like a bunch of islands that are flipped cause then we could just move both these guys here, and if it's your turn next like you could kind of free up a couple.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : So we'll use that like as an emergency to move the Engineer somewhere.
1 : So say that-
3 : Emergency safe
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah, cause if we could just move
3 : vehicle.
1 : Because you can hold five so just keep it.
4 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
4 : And you can use it at anytime so like you can use it right before your turn if
3 : Ok
4 : if I draw like a Flood Rises and everything starts sinking.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : So now I go, let's see, so I'm here.
4 : What should I do? So I have
4 : this-
4 : Um ok
4 : Let's see how close are we, we- So you still need one more. Do we have a set of four yet? No, we're close, everyone has a set of three.
4 : So
4 : I guess
4 : I'll just move to
4 : (--) so I have a bunch of actions to use, so let's see, I should probably
4 : t-
3 : Yeah
4 : give
4 : the- Do you, well you know- You have five,
4 : you have four cards. I could give you the Earth chalice and we could plan on using one of the hol-Helicopter lifts pretty soon.
3 : We could do that.
4 : Yeah, ok, so I'd move
4 : to you. You're the, you're blue right?
3 : Yeah
4 : yeah
4 : Ok, so that's two actions
4 : Um
3 : Now, do I get rid of it now?
3 : Or at my turn?
2 : Mm
4 : Or
2 : Your turn
4 : I, ah for the, well yeah, we gotta figure out if we even need these. I'll, I'll do one more so you can say up to three (sets) and I'll probably just
3 : And my turn, ok?
4 : Stay there for now
4 : and
4 : pull out two
4 : (--), so start with the two treasure cards.
3 : (or) two?
2 : Yeah, yeah.
4 : Ok
4 : So I've got
4 : ok, so we've almost got a set.
2 : Well we, we do now, once we
1 : We do.
4 : Yeah, once, once it all gets transferred over, so that's convenient. Ok.
4 : And then
4 : the
4 : Flood cards too.
4 : Let's see what's sinking.
4 : Looks like Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.
3 : Iron Gate.
2 : Whispering Garden's up top.
4 : It's right here, yeah ok.
4 : cool.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Engineer
1 : Mm
4 : We might wanna forget Whispering Garden.
1 : Well
4 : Oh wait, you're the way down there though.
1 : Yeah
1 : I have to be beside it, right?
4 : Yeah, well
4 : Or we could use our Helicopter lift to but
4 : let's see, where else is the Earth statue?
4 : There's one way at the-
1 : Anybody can use his Helicopter lift, or he can only use his Helicopter lift?
3 : Uh yeah, I think only I can use- Ok.
4 : Only you can use it, yea, but I just mean as a team
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : Or we could use sandbags if we're really concerned.
4 : we could-
1 : Ss
4 : But
4 : let's see
2 : I mean if you wanted, you- Can't you move? You can move two spaces at a time, so you could move up two and then
2 : flip
2 : the Whispering Gardens, cause it's adjacent to you, if you'd like
4 : That would work too, yeah.
1 : I can use- I can move twice?
2 : that?
4 : (--)
2 : Right?
4 : Yup.
4 : Yeah, you can move twice. You either gotta be three actions all together, cause it'd be
2 : I'm pretty sure.
1 : (pretty sure)
4 : one move,
4 : two moves, and your third action would be flipping the Whispering Garden.
1 : So these aren't all counted as di- I thought you
2 : I thought the Engineer can just move two at a time.
1 : I can, no I can-
2 : Like up to two spaces, right?
1 : No I can flip two cards, I can
3 : Oh
1 : choose two tiles.
1 : I can shore up two tiles,
2 : Oh
1 : not moving twice.
4 : Yeah that's her special, that's her special ability
4 : But you have to be next to them.
1 : Right, but if I'm- Uh you can move twice? Because I thought you can pick up to these three actions that you could do.
1 : You can move three times, you can shore up,
1 : you can't-
4 : Yeah, yeah, EG moves three, move one and shore two, yeah you can move three.
3 : I think so.
2 : Yeah, so
1 : I can move, ok, alright.
4 : Yeah
4 : As long as it's no more than three. So you can only do three things.
2 : Move- So you can move, move
1 : Alright
1 : So move, move, flip
4 : Move and then shore.
2 : and shore up.
1 : Ok.
4 : OK and that's pretty, it's a pretty good defensive move. And now we'll find out
2 : There we go.
1 : And then I have to do this.
2 : Alright, so two cards we got.
3 : Yup.
1 : Ok
4 : Let's see if Water Rises comes up.
1 : Yup.
3 : Oh.
2 : Ugh
4 : Ok
4 : So
1 : Great, so now
4 : You can discard the water ri-, or uh we can, doesn't really matter what (order's on) if we
1 : Uh
4 : move it up and then shuffle the cards and put em on top.
1 : I have to do this.
1 : Great.
4 : Let's see how we do.
1 : I take three.
1 : Alright, Iron Gate,
4 : Temple of the Moon, I see.
3 : Gone.
1 : gone.
2 : Goodness.
1 : (did you do (--)
1 : Temple Moon
4 : Yeah, and I flipped it already.
1 : and then Cliffs of Abandon.
3 : Oh, where was it?
4 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Here we go.
4 : Yeah, ok, right in the center.
1 : Oh
2 : Alright.
2 : Oh dear.
4 : Ok, well Cliffs of Abandon isn't really that
1 : (I have this)
1 : (this)
4 : big of a deal. It's a nice stepping stone though.
1 : (this)
4 : Ok, so now we're all in the same
2 : Alright
4 : tile, so Messenger-
2 : So my turn.
4 : Yeah.
2 : Alright
2 : so
2 : I can move
1 : and flip
2 : and I can
2 : do this one?
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yup and you can do the one you're doing at yeah.
2 : And then count this as my third one too.
4 : (if you want to)
2 : Alright, so there's my,
2 : there's my three moves.
2 : So now I gotta pick up two of these
4 : Yup
2 : I have this
4 : More sandbags, ok that's good.
2 : and another sandbag.
4 : That's good.
2 : So
3 : Alright
4 : Oh, but ok, so you have, you have an extra cards.
2 : Oh, I have an extra. I have six cards now, I gotta get rid of something.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Could you use- No.
4 : Yeah, we should.
4 : Yeah, you can, (--) could we use a sandbag, nah
2 : Well what, what do we do with the-
1 : Get rid of that.
3 : But you, there's nothing
1 : Right, I was just gonna say, get rid of that one.
4 : Yeah, get rid of that.
2 : Why don't I get- Cause it looks like we're g- we're on the way.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Let's just, let's just plan on getting on the is- Ah getting off the island without the uh, yeah.
3 : Yeah
2 : So do I just discard here?
1 : Mmhmm.
3 : Yeah.
4 : Let's just plan on getting off the island without that
2 : Alrighty
2 : and then I gotta take three cards.
4 : Yeah
4 : Let's hopefully nothing
2 : Two, three.
2 : Um, I got the Crimson Forest, the Temple of the Sun, and the Whispering Gardens.
4 : Ok.
3 : (--) Temple of the Sun
1 : Temple of the Sun
1 : you got it? Whispering Gardens? you got that one too?
2 : Ok
4 : There's no, ok, there's no reason that we couldn't
4 : basically ok.
2 : We can, we can get those back in, in shape.
4 : Yeah, we can, so what we should do. So you have
3 : oh
2 : So it's your turn now though
4 : enough. We're on the same place though right?
4 : Yeah, ok cool.
4 : Cause I'm gonna give you this card when it's my turn I think.
2 : I gotta get rid of something though, don't I?
4 : K-
4 : Yeah, well it's- we can use the sandbags at any point. We can do it now even? Yeah, I think
2 : Can I just get rid of
2 : Oh, play it anytime. True.
4 : Yeah, so we can use it for this guy and this guy and then you'd have
4 : plenty of space.
2 : K
4 : Just cause that way,
4 : but we can wait.
2 : Why don't we just do-
2 : Well let's do Whispering- Can I do it now?
4 : Yeah, but why don't we wait till the next, yeah.
2 : We'll wait till you're handing it to me. Alright.
3 : Ok.
4 : Well, actually before that. Probably wh- if he gets another Flood Rises card we'll do, we'll do it before then cause they can't be
3 : Huh
2 : Alright
2 : You go ahead, then.
4 : drawn as it stands.
3 : Ok
2 : Pilot
3 : I have two Helicopters and I- Well I have six
3 : cards, so one has to be get
3 : taken care of. I can use Helicopter
2 : Well this is just your like regular card.
4 : Oh yeah that doesn't count, yeah.
3 : Oh, never mind.
1 : Yeah that doesn't count.
2 : I'm just gonna put this like over here so we, yeah.
3 : Whoops, yeah.
4 : Yeah
4 : Yep
4 : That doesn't count.
2 : Alright
3 : Um
3 : So I mean
2 : Well you can fly somewhere
4 : Yeah well it'd be more purposeful to fly someone else but yeah we should keep the Helicopter lifts and then let's see
4 : Ok, so you should give your chalice to her
4 : probably, that's one turn.
2 : Yeah
2 : So one
3 : So one
4 : Cause
4 : Yeah cause I'm gonna give you a chalice as well.
1 : K
1 : K
4 : Just get ready to discard that, probably that.
1 : K
2 : The fire.
3 : Chali-
4 : Flames thing, yeah.
2 : Uh
3 : Where should I go? I mean it-
2 : You
2 : Well maybe we want- Maybe, maybe, y- well you're the Pilot so you can just fly so maybe you wanna fly here and flip that.
3 : Yeah, I was thinking I could fly
4 : Yeah just
3 : so thats
4 : so that's your seconda action and then
3 : two,
4 : well yeah, that works perfect.
3 : three could be
2 : Yeah, there's three.
3 : flip over.
1 : hm
4 : Sweet.
2 : Alright, so now two of these.
3 : Mm
4 : Ok they all have to discard some things so get rid of that.
4 : flame.
3 : Yeah.
4 : Cause we're not leaving the island with that, I don't think.
3 : And then, three
1 : Three
2 : Two and three
2 : There you go.
3 : Ok.
2 : What do you have?
3 : So Silver Gate,
2 : (up there)
3 : Tidal Palace,
3 : and then Copper Gate.
3 : Right here,
3 : wait no.
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
4 : So
2 : Here you can just put those in the discard
4 : That'll be my turn.
2 : or I mean in the flood discard
3 : Yes, (that's right)
2 : Alright.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mm
2 : Your turn, explorer.
4 : (Why don't)
4 : Yeah cause I'm gonna give you a card, why don't we use sandbags to free up
2 : Alright
2 : so first thing,
4 : um
4 : which one can I not get to? I can get to this one and free this one up. I can free up this-
2 : so why don't you like
4 : Let's see
2 : free up something first.
4 : Yeah, ok, so I'll free up the most important one cause I know we're gonna need this one.
2 : Yeah
4 : Unless we're gonna get all the way down to Howling Garden.
2 : Ok
4 : which
4 : The Pilot would have to do that.
2 : You're green, right?
4 : Yeah, so I used one action and then another action
4 : I'm gonna give you- Well you should use sandbags so I can give you this.
2 : Ok, I'll use sandbags on
4 : Probably that one, cause it's got something on it.
2 : Ok, we'll use it on Tidal Palace.
3 : Yeah.
4 : And then, so I'll (give this) my second action and then
2 : So that's your second action and you can,
2 : you can free up one more if you want.
4 : My third action I was actually gonna give her this card so she can take the chalice, but to do that you have to get rid of the fire.
3 : Oh, right, yeah.
2 : Oh
2 : Alright, good thinking.
1 : K
1 : K
4 : Crystal.
1 : When it's my turn?
4 : Yeah- Oh, either- Well, cause you have five cards it doesn't matter you have to discard it- What does it say? Yeah you have to- If you already have five cards you must discard one.
1 : Right?
1 : Right
1 : Right
2 : Just check though.
3 : (Think)
2 : They have to be s- on the same tile as you.
4 : Oh oh, we're not- Are we on the same tile?
1 : It has to be the same tile.
3 : Oh, oh, you have to be
2 : Crap!
4 : Oh, the Pilot, oh I wasn't on the same tile
1 : oh, hm
4 : as-
4 : Oh yeah, I wasn't on the same tile as you. Ok, yeah.
2 : Well you can move to the same tile as- you could've
1 : No wait
3 : No wait, you're green red, yeah.
1 : You're on the same tile as me.
4 : I'm on the same tile as you but not you.
2 : You're on the same tile.
1 : Yeah
2 : But not me, so you have,
1 : That's fine.
4 : Yeah
4 : So let's see
2 : so you would have to move to the same tile as me.
4 : yeah (give it)
4 : (back), I'll figure it out. so let's see, I flipped one, I used one turn,
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : What was your first-
4 : so I have two turns so I can only
4 : move at that point or
1 : And you flipped one.
2 : So you shouldn't have flipped, so you should not have flipped one.
4 : Well I, I think we need this, this is more important. Cause oh, unless you want to use sandbags again?
4 : And then
4 : that would save me another turn, if you wanna do that and just use
4 : discard sandbags
4 : and then I can get you this as well.
2 : Well you- we-
3 : I can give you back sand-
4 : Well, we already used one sandbags for this one
3 : If you, ok.
3 : Oh, that's right, ok.
4 : I'm, I'm suggesting that if we use another sandbags we can get rid of this and then that, you have this card.
1 : Right, because I have to be on that tile to use these. Wait no I have to be on a
2 : What if we really need sandbags later though?
4 : Yeah
1 : I have to be on this tile.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, that's the thing too, what if we really need sandbags?
2 : Well fine then, let's just not use the sandbags for this one, and what instead we would've used sandbags for the Whispering Garden.
3 : yeah
4 : Ok
4 : Yeah, ok.
2 : So you're first- So you're one turn.
4 : That's fine
2 : would be
2 : first you give her the
4 : Yeah
2 : thing
2 : then
4 : Yeah, so I already did that. One,
3 : Mm
2 : move to the same one as me as your second,
4 : Yeah, and then I'll give you the
2 : so now you can give me this.
3 : Oh ok.
4 : Yeah ok, and then you're gonna have to- Once it's your turn you're gonna have to try and get up here.
2 : Alright
1 : Ah
2 : Yeah
4 : And get to that.
4 : And, so the chalice is your next place is gonna try to get here.
2 : Alright, well
3 : You can go- Or
4 : So if I get, if I get Flood Rises, y-yeah so I gotta uh take- Ah ok yeah so I'll take two cards.
2 : Let's do the next thing cause we're running low on time.
3 : (--)
1 : (I know)
1 : Ok so how do I get
1 : to a ch-
1 : to here?
4 : Yeah I just have to take two cards.
2 : You gotta get to a chalice.
4 : Yeah that's
4 : So
1 : Right, that's what I'm saying, I can't.
2 : Where are you?
1 : (And)
4 : You'll be able to, in a sec.
3 : Oh you're red. One, two, three.
2 : What are you?
1 : Red.
4 : Yeah.
4 : We'll find a way, yeah. Hey pass me
3 : Or
2 : there's only three s- things though
3 : But remember I can fly her
2 : and you have six
4 : Wait yeah, I have, I have to take two cards first. We can't move yet.
2 : You have six cards you have to get rid of this as well?
1 : Ok, get rid of this one.
4 : Yeah, yeah.
2 : Yeah.
4 : So I have to grab-
4 : Yeah, you can't move yet though, I have to do the two cards and then
3 : Oh.
1 : Oh, I'm sorry.
3 : K, here's your two cards.
4 : Yeah, oh that's what I was kind of worried about. Worter Water Rises.
3 : Ah.
1 : I thought it was my turn.
4 : So we gotta shuffle those
4 : over there
4 : (put that back in there)
2 : And besides, we could always use a Helicopter, right?
3 : (over here)
3 : Yeah,
3 : because then I could just fly her to the Coral Place.
2 : And then we'll get our first treasure.
4 : Yeah.
3 : yeah
4 : Ok
4 : (exactly)
4 : So, these three are Crimson Forest, Copper Gate, and Temple of the Sun.
4 : So t- Wait Temple of the Sun.
2 : Crimson Forest is gone.
3 : These two are gone.
4 : yeah
4 : These two are gone, yeah.
4 : T-
4 : Ok.
2 : K
3 : And I flipped the Temple of the Sun already.
4 : And then Temple of the Sun. Ok, so that goes back over there.
1 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : my turn.
2 : Alright so it's
4 : Now it's your turn.
2 : it is your turn now.
1 : Now I have to get to this chalice to collect it.
4 : Ok
2 : We can use the Helicopter to get there.
4 : Yeah
3 : I'm gonna use a Helicopter so you don't have to use any of your moves.
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
3 : And I can move her
4 : So that's Coral Palace.
3 : to Coral Pal-. You're red so
1 : Mmhmm
3 : move to Coral Palace.
1 : Move here?
4 : Ok, so then your first action's gonna be
2 : So we have to discard Heli
2 : copter.
4 : to get the treasure. And then your second and third action should probably get to Fool's Landing but I'm not sure.
1 : I t-
1 : So I take all the-
4 : That's my guess
4 : But yes, that can be your first action.
2 : Well
2 : we have to fly away at the end, so
2 : why don't we
4 : Yeah
2 : maybe she could move and then flip.
1 : How do I get the treasure though?
4 : Yeah, that works, that's a good one.
3 : You have it.
2 : Well you
1 : Ok
2 : You- That just counts as one move.
4 : Yeah, technically.
3 : (--) it's one of your
1 : Take these
4 : Yeah
2 : Yup
4 : And
2 : So you got it now, so we can just
3 : Right
4 : Probably put those in discard, yeah.
2 : discard here.
1 : Ok
2 : Alright so
1 : So that-
1 : But that was my second move.
2 : That was one action.
4 : That was one move, cause he
1 : That was only one?
4 : Yeah, his, his Helicopter Lift was a
2 : Yeah that
3 : Cause my Helicopter
1 : Alright
2 : Yeah
2 : So now
3 : took care of you.
2 : maybe perhaps move here and flip.
1 : Move here to turn this
4 : And then flip Temple.
4 : Yeah, that's a good one.
2 : Good.
3 : Ok
2 : So now you need two of these.
4 : So now,
1 : Ok
4 : so Tidal Palace doesn't really matter anymore cause we got the chalice.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok, I got a Lift and another one of these.
3 : Good, ok.
4 : Oh cool.
1 : Alright, we got four, not we got four- We got three treasures if we hurry up.
2 : Sweet
3 : We got
2 : Alright
2 : now
2 : Um, we need
1 : I have to take three, crap.
2 : three of these.
2 : There you go.
2 : Hopefully we didn't lose anything too important.
4 : Yeah, this'll work.
1 : Ok, alright. Tidal Palace,
3 : Gone
2 : Good, cause we don't need that anymore.
2 : Well, not good, but

1 : Wait- We need to get to here.
4 : Can you get, yeah can you get to Whispering Garden and turn in?
2 : Where?
4 : That'd be here, or down there.
2 : Where am I?
4 : So you can get to
2 : Alright, so I'll do
4 : Let's see where are you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2 : Here we go.
4 : Ok
2 : We got two treasures.
3 : That's your treasure.
4 : Yup
4 : Ok, now let's see if we can
2 : So now I gotta
2 : collect two of these cards here.
4 : (--)
2 : I have two fires, uh that's not that helpful.
3 : Fire fire
1 : K
4 : Yeah, whatever
2 : And now I take
1 : Three
1 : Three
2 : three of these.
2 : We have
2 : Cliffs of Abandon,
2 : Whispering Garden,
2 : Dunces of Deception.
4 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : And Whispering Garden is what I'm on.
4 : Whispering Garden's what you're on. Yeah
2 : I'm ok there right? Alright good. I don't wanna- Just wanna make sure I don't have to swim anywhere.
1 : K mmhmm
4 : Yeah
4 : Even-yeah, even if you do, we'll be fine cause we got the
2 : Alright
4 : treasure too.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Go ahead, Pilot.
4 : Ok, so let's see if we can find a devisive way
3 : (Pile)
4 : (Cause you've got those two).
3 : I mean I can, I can
2 : What if
1 : Yeah you (--)
2 : you could just one, two,
4 : Yeah
2 : give em
3 : Take one move
2 : give em to her.
3 : and go to her.
2 : Or, or to the uh
1 : Two
4 : Cause yeah, you can fly anywhere.
2 : the Engineer.
1 : Right
3 : So I can fly once and for my next two moves, give you two.
4 : And then two moves, perfect, that's such a great way to do it, yeah.
1 : Aha
2 : Yeah
3 : So that way you're, you're set to go.
4 : I was worried I was gonna have to get one down there, that would not have helped.
1 : K
1 : K
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : So you did your three moves
1 : Now you have an- Do you have one more- You have one more move, you need it.
4 : Nope
3 : No, cause I gave you
2 : No, the flying
1 : Oh, oh, oh, oh, ok
4 : Cause yeah, each card counts as a move.
1 : Ok
3 : No, she's important because she has the treasure and the flying card, so you're like our ace.
4 : Yeah
1 : I'm it
4 : You're definitely our, you're definitely our route out of here.
1 : You guys need me.
3 : Two treasures
3 : which we don't need and then
3 : I'll take the floods.
2 : We need-
2 : there we go.
4 : (--)
2 : What do we have?
3 : Cave of Embers,
2 : Alright that's right there.
4 : (--)
3 : Bronze Gate,
3 : which is right there,
4 : That's probably, yeah.
3 : and Cave of Shadows.
1 : Ok, that's good
4 : no problem
2 : Alright, so, you can
2 : can you put these here?
2 : or I mean, I'll-I'll take them out
3 : Yeah,
3 : Uh no over there, yeah
2 : Ok
4 : K
3 : Although we have to be careful that
3 : they make it
3 : to us somehow, because they're, they're getting on pretty loose ground.
4 : So cause of your, cause of your Helicopter Lift we've got a good chance to get someone out, worst comes to worst
1 : I (need) this.
2 : Well
2 : good, cause we still have two
3 : Ok
4 : yeah, we still have two so we're definitely gonna get out.
1 : K
2 : Uh, I still have a sandbag too if we do need that.
4 : Sweet.
3 : Oh, you have a sandbag, ok.
4 : That's perfect, so we can use that at anytime. Ok, so I'm just gonna go
2 : Ok, well it's your turn.
1 : Go ahead, Explorer.
4 : I'm just gonna make one move and that'll be it.
3 : Ok
4 : There's nothing else I can do,
4 : I don't think.
3 : We're not on
4 : I can, I can flip stuff, yeah.
2 : Well flip
3 : Yeah, I'd flip
4 : I can flip both of these.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : for security reasons I would do it.
4 : That's fine, yeah, one
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
4 : two, so there you go and I can get back
2 : So that's your three moves.
4 : Yup
2 : So here's your two cards.
4 : Mm
4 : More treasures that we don't need and let's see what that has three, yeah.
2 : One,
2 : two,
2 : three, there you go.
4 : Ok, it looks like Watchtower, Misty Marsh, and Howling Garden.
4 : So
2 : Watchtower,
3 : (Watch)
2 : Where's
4 : There probably all, yeah.
2 : Here's the Watchtower.
2 : Oh
1 : Mm Watchtower, so your
3 : Oh
2 : Uh oh
4 : Yeah
1 : That's alright, you can swim.
2 : What is it? Misty Marsh,
4 : Yup, Misty Marsh
2 : and what?
4 : Uh Watchtower.
2 : We got that, Watchtower, Misty Marsh, and what?
4 : Oh sorry the
4 : Howling Garden, that was the last one.
3 : Bottom one.
2 : Howling Garden, there we go.
1 : K
2 : Alright
1 : Alright, so I need to be
1 : on this
2 : You need to get to
3 : Which is this one.
2 : (--)
1 : K
3 : So that's one move
2 : so one move
4 : So move
4 : Then
4 : two moves,
3 : (turn in to get)
1 : (--)
1 : Three treasures
3 : Your treasure
1 : K and then I can- And then what do I- Like how do I get us to go?
2 : And then
3 : I would
4 : You sh- save that, you should probably just move cause we're not really in any
2 : (You should)
1 : Ok
4 : danger, unless you guys wanna like finish fast.
1 : Can I- Should I just turn this over or no, doesn't matter, that card doesn't matter.
4 : No
3 : I mean you could go over here just so that you're on the landing. Yeah.
4 : But you can't move diagonally.
1 : Cause we all have to be there to fly out.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Wait can you move
4 : But that would- No she can't move diagonally, yeah I can- I'm the only one that can move, so that'd be the Observatory.
3 : Ok
2 : The Engineer can't move diagonally though, so
3 : Oh
1 : Wait, I can't what?
2 : You can't move diagonally.
4 : You can't move diagonally.
1 : Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
2 : So-
3 : But-
4 : I'd say move to the Observatory for now, and I think- I don't think-
1 : K
4 : Yeah, I think we're gonna be able to finish the game
1 : Alright
2 : Alright
4 : pretty quick.
2 : So now, my turn?
4 : (um)
4 : Well, she's gotta take two cards, right?
1 : Oh
3 : Oh
2 : Oh oops.
1 : Two
2 : Sorry
4 : Yeah, so Water Rises
3 : Oh, well
1 : Oh, shoot.
2 : Aw
1 : Aw
4 : Ok, so
4 : let's think
1 : We're still ok, we're at three.
4 : what should we use sandbags on cause your character can't get lost out here.
4 : So if Misty Marsh falls through before we, before we draw any- First you guys shuffle the deck, first.
1 : Get rid of that.
1 : Oops
2 : Well if Whispering Gardens does too, that's not,
4 : Yeah, so
2 : that's no good.
4 : What we can do- Before, before we draw the cards though, so you can put them down. Before we draw the cards- Yeah, don't draw them yet, cause we can use the sandbag before they get drawn, but not after.
1 : Why?
2 : Wait, time out, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
3 : So yeah we're (-- nothing)
1 : Oh
2 : Wait, can't we just use the Heli- There's three Helicopters. Can we use the Helicopter for me?
3 : Yeah
4 : Who's got the third? Oh yeah, wow she's got both, ok, ok.
2 : (Theres)
2 : Can we-
3 : I mean I could use mine.
1 : Play it at any time, does not count as an action, discard or treasure (--).
4 : Yeah
2 : It's anytime so that counts as
1 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile as any other tile, or lift your team off of Fool's Landing. We all have to be on Fool's Landing.
2 : right now as anytime.
4 : Yeah, that's what I'm saying, yeah.
4 : Yeah, but before we draw those, obviously.
3 : Oh
3 : what did- We can end the game right now.
4 : Yeah, as long as they're all in the same place.
4 : Yeah, we could.
1 : Why?
4 : Cause you can, you can Helicop- It'll be- Who's, who's move is it? It's gonna be her move next.
3 : We can all
1 : So I can move, here wait, I can move
2 : Uh, we should just
3 : Alright
4 : Yeah
1 : you with me.
2 : kinda get- Maybe we should get me to safety.
4 : Yeah, we would get you to safety and then
4 : Uh we can use a Helicopter Lift for you and then your move just goes.
2 : I'm concerned about me.
1 : Ok,
1 : I'm gonna move you.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok, so that's
1 : Take that.
3 : Yes
2 : So that's one.
1 : I'm gonna move
1 : myself,
1 : nah you,
4 : Yeah, yeah, yeah then leave her cause her turn will be next and now we've gotta take the three Forbidden Island cards
1 : Ok, right.
3 : Oh right thank you.
1 : Ok
4 : Let's see if we sunk anything.
1 : Oh
3 : Cause even if that fl-
2 : Wait a, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1 : What?
2 : Oh, (--), no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry, sorry.
3 : yeah
4 : Yeah, now anything can sink. Now it doesn't really matter.
1 : Ok
1 : Whispering Gardens,
3 : oh
4 : That's gone.
2 : Oh, see,
3 : Wow, ok.
2 : I would've had to swim.
1 : Um, Howling Garden.
4 : Yeah, that's what I was worried about.
3 : Bottom
4 : Yeah, Howling Garden.
2 : That's gone.
1 : Yeah but what if she did have to swim and she was gone? Does that- the game's over?
2 : The game's over, I would've lost.
4 : That's why I was gonna say, we should just, we should've- What, what we would've had to do is, we would've had to
1 : Oh
3 : Yeah
2 : Or we would've lost.
3 : I've been scared, right there.
4 : sandbag Misty Marsh.
1 : And Misty Marsh.
2 : Ooo see.
4 : Yeah
2 : I would've been out of here.
4 : If we hadn't of sand bagged it, that's why I was like
3 : Wow
1 : Ok
4 : But yeah, we're good. That was a bad idea to fly.
1 : So
4 : Your turn and you end the game once we, once you use the Helicopter Lift.
1 : Your turn.
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : She has to (--)
2 : What am I doing? Oh
4 : You're just moving.
1 : Ok.
2 : My move- Well I don't have to move anywhere.
3 : You can just turn to Watchtower and just leave yourself.
4 : (--)
1 : That's me though, how- yeah.
3 : Yeah, that's her, yeah.
4 : Oh that's you, oh no!
1 : Yeah.
4 : That's what I got confused about.
3 : Wait so, if we survive
1 : I'm not with you guys, you're gonna leave me behind. You're gonna Helicopter out and leave me, leave me.
4 : Ah
4 : I miss- Yeah I misread that. That was the only part
2 : Yeah, that's, that's why we should have moved
1 : I saved everyone but myself, thanks.
3 : Let's do this
2 : her
4 : Yeah
4 : We'll figure it out,
4 : we'll get there.
3 : How about this
2 : Alright
4 : You just have to take two cards and
2 : Alright well there's nothing else to do, so uh
4 : Hopefully nothing will get flooded in the mean time.
2 : Ok well that's not going to do anything for us.
4 : I mean we can try and get the flame if you really want to. Here, I mean you're the Messenger so you can send the cards but you can't t- Ah, don't bother.
2 : We don't need the flame.
1 : Yeah we don't even need it.
4 : Yeah.
2 : I'll pick up three of these now.
4 : We don't need it but we could take it
2 : Um
4 : (At the rate this is going)
2 : The Dunes are outta here,
4 : Yeah
2 : the Cliffs
4 : of Abandon are flipped
2 : of Abandon and the Cave of Shadows are also flipped.
1 : Ok
4 : Cave of Shadows are flipped, ok.
1 : Alright
2 : Ok we got
1 : K don't flood (don't)
2 : We gotta-
2 : Oh,
2 : here we go.
3 : Oh right there.
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Pilot
3 : My turn?
1 : Yes.
2 : Yeah.
4 : Yeah, make sure you save the Helicopter Lift, unfortunately.
3 : Yeah,
3 : I'm not moving but I am turning
1 : To
4 : Good
3 : to
2 : Mmhmm
4 : And then
1 : And he can Helicopter me with you.
3 : and
2 : No we need it to get out of here.
1 : No, because we need it to leave, oh.
3 : But when you-
3 : Yeah.
3 : (--)
3 : Well,
1 : Uh
3 : No unless I pick up an extra Helicopter.
4 : Yeah well we'll see just
3 : If that-
2 : But who knows if we will?
1 : But how would you know, right.
4 : Just end your turn, just end your turn and find out, let's see.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Right
3 : I- yeah.
3 : Ok, so we're gonna leave it like that
4 : Might as well.
2 : Just,
1 : Ok
2 : we should just stop there.
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah
3 : Oh oh, sandbag
4 : Isn't there a sandbag (in there)?
3 : and I have to get rid of one, which-
1 : Ok
3 : I'll just do this.
4 : Yeah
2 : K
4 : Ok
2 : Well we need to
4 : Um I go.
1 : Oh you need your flood cards
4 : Yeah you need
4 : three flood cards.
3 : Yeah my flood cards.
3 : We're at three
4 : It's ok.
3 : So
3 : Temple of the Moon's gone,
2 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Temple of the Sun,
3 : and then Bronze Gate is gone.
1 : K
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
4 : So I'm just gonna flip Cliffs of Abandon and Temple of the Sun
4 : For my turn
3 : Yeah
4 : and then I'll just take two of the treasure cards.
2 : K
2 : Ugh
4 : (Nothing)
2 : Come on we needed a Helicopter!
4 : and yeah three of the
3 : You need to get rid of one.
4 : flood card- Oh yeah, I do have to get rid of one.
4 : What are these- This is the Observatory, Cave of Embers, and Watchtower.
3 : Watchtower's gone.
4 : So you're on the Observatory.
3 : K, that's what I'm afraid of.
4 : Ok
4 : and what is it, what is it?
4 : Watchto- Oh Cave of Embers is gone then.
3 : Cave of Embers
3 : It's gone
2 : Island is shrinking.
3 : We're sinking.
4 : Whoops
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : (--)
4 : So like (ok, we move)
2 : Alright
1 : So all I wanna do is move is my butt over here.
3 : Yes
4 : And
4 : and game over, Helicopter Lift, yay.
3 : And I call support
3 : and we're out.
1 : Ok
1 : Whoo hoo
4 : Three treasures.
1 : Mm

1 : Ah
3 : Alright
2 : Alright
1 : Alright, so I'll start
2 : It's all you
1 : Um
2 : So
1 : Alright, so three actions
2 : Yeah
1 : I'll move
1 : here
1 : and then shore
1 : these two up.
3 : Ok
1 : That's two actions,
1 : and then
2 : And then you can do a third.
1 : Yeah
1 : Um
2 : Well
1 : I guess I can shore up again
2 : I was gonna say-
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, let's-
2 : Ei- Either do that or m
2 : hmmm
3 : You can either move or shore up, so
2 : Yeah, but I was gonna say move or shore up, but if you move, probably move to a flooded one if you decide that.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright,
1 : eh, actually, no, I'll shore up.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Either way it's not
3 : (Oh yeah)
1 : And then two of those, can you pass me those, yeah
2 : So,
2 : yeah
1 : Thanks. Ah, great, great
2 : Killing us already
1 : So this goes up
2 : But you still pick two
1 : Uh, you're right.
2 : Right
3 : (Water)
2 : Yeah
1 : So that's gone, right?
1 : And then
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And then,
1 : Shuffle those? Alright
2 : wait, we have to shuffle these first.
2 : Go ahead
1 : Do we get to see em, (--), I don't know
3 : You can, I don't know, it doesn't matter.
1 : Alright, I don't know if that really matters.
3 : There's a lot
2 : Just, yeah
2 : And then, pick two, yeah
1 : And then, two?
1 : Oh,
1 : so that one, oh these two actually.
2 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : Cool
2 : and then
1 : uh, I think I'm done.
2 : It's my-
3 : Your turn.
2 : Is that right, are we done?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah, I'm done.
2 : Oh so (--)
2 : Ok
2 : So
3 : You're the
3 : teal one?
2 : I'm, right there
1 : Teal
2 : Um
2 : I don't really need to give a card to anyone, I don't think
3 : Hmmm I would stay put for now.
2 : Yeah, I can just keep it.
2 : Um
2 : I can move,
2 : I guess I'll move here.
1 : Yeah
2 : And then I can
2 : shore up.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Mm
2 : I don't really need to
3 : As your second one?
2 : Should I do another action or
1 : Yeah, I mean we could shore up. Like I guess shoring up's always a good choice.
3 : Can you shore up something else?
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : As a third action.
1 : Mm
1 : Nice
2 : And then, two treasure cards
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Right
3 : Because we know that like, it's going to sink otherwise.
2 : Yeah
1 : Right, I don't like how you like put em on top, cause then they're about to go up again, yeah.
3 : You know that it's-
2 : And then
1 : Uh
2 : I still have to pick two flood cards
1 : Ye- Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um, Phantom Rock and Gold Gate.
2 : T-
2 : Oh, there's
1 : Phantom Rock's gone
2 : Oh, yeah, ok
1 : And the
1 : Gold Gate, is that it?
1 : Why- What's that yellow thing at the bottom?
2 : Gold
2 : Alright
2 : I don't know,
2 : I don't know what that is
1 : I don't think they ever explained it. Yeah, whatever.
3 : Ok, it's fine.
2 : I don't think it matters,
1 : We good, we good
2 : they're just pawn pieces.
3 : (Bye)
1 : But like the edges are kinda not really important,
1 : so I think we'll be alright.
2 : Just for the treasures
3 : Uh, my turn?
1 : Yeah
2 : Yes
3 : Um
3 : I don't really need to do anything
1 : You're blue right?
3 : Yeah
1 : Um
2 : You could fl-
2 : Wait, can't- You can fly anywhere.
3 : I can go right wherever I want.
2 : Do you wanna fly to Lost Lagoon and shore it up?
3 : Sure
1 : Mm
3 : Why not
2 : Cause flying doesn't count as an action, right, for you?
3 : Um
1 : Probably does, I don't know.
3 : No it
2 : Does it?
3 : does, yeah.
2 : Ok
2 : And then you can
1 : Shore that up.
3 : I can shore up adjacent ones, or?
1 : Yeah, you can shore up adjacent
2 : Yeah
2 : Or the ones that you're on
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, that's fine.
1 : that's two actions
1 : And then, I don't know I mean, there's not that much to do.
2 : Yeah
3 : Um
1 : I don't know
3 : So (--) probably gonna go is
3 : this one and
3 : that one, right?
2 : Uh
3 : That's ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Well, if you, yeah, if you pick a flood card, then yeah
3 : Right,
3 : ok
3 : Um,
1 : Alright, we're good
2 : So,
3 : do I need to do a third, or-
2 : you don't have to if you don't want to.
1 : Yeah, I mean you could fly so it's not a big deal.
3 : Oh
3 : Um, so then I pick two of these
3 : and
3 : What are all these Helicopter Lifts
1 : Nice
3 : Alright
3 : well these are my four.
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh, I forgot about the five cards.
1 : Alright
2 : Yeah I have four- You only have three, so
1 : Mmhmm
3 : And I need to
3 : I guess shuffle and like the
2 : Well, do- wait do you have to do it every- I think it's just with the Water Rise cards that you have to shuffle.
3 : (same)
1 : Yeah, so I think you just pick two.
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh
3 : oh
1 : Whatcha get?
3 : Lost Lagoon,
1 : That's this, oh that was a good flip.
3 : And Cliffs of Abandon, oh so this one.
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Alright
2 : That was a good move.
1 : Yeah, good work.
2 : Flipping that- shoring that up.
3 : And then that's it
3 : Discard that.
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : so it's my turn?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Hmm
1 : Here I'll try to shore those two up, I guess. Shore one,
1 : one move here, that's two actions, and then shore this.
3 : Well did you need to move?
1 : Uh yeah, cause I can't do it diagonal.
2 : Yeah, cause it wasn't adjacent.
3 : You can't do diagonal, ok.
1 : Mm
1 : So that's three moves and then
1 : draw-
1 : Can you pass me two treasure cards please?
1 : Thank you
1 : Thanks.
3 : That's your third move?
1 : Uh,
1 : nah that was like
3 : Or you have one more
1 : a required action I think.
1 : Yeah (--)
2 : I think you have to pick treasure cards.
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh, as in you're done with your three moves, right? Ok. Uh
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : And then two of these
1 : Whispering Garden,
2 : Mm
1 : Oh here it is.
1 : and
1 : Iron Gate.
2 : That's right here.
1 : Yep.
1 : Oh that kinda sucks.
2 : Ok
1 : Uh, then, I think I'm done.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
1 : Alright, so there's no to like bring these down, right?
1 : (--)
2 : Hmm
3 : I don't think so.
2 : No, cause you'll lose if you get to five, so
1 : So we're kinda
3 : You can't unsink an Island.
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Yo, they can rig it so we go up to here automatically and then we're done.
2 : I don't know if there's really anything I need to
2 : do.
3 : Um
1 : Uh
1 : I mean we
2 : cause I'm not near any cards that are
1 : Right. Maybe we can like
1 : stack up on these and
1 : or
1 : I don't know, get em sorted out, but doesn't really matter.
3 : I keep thinking that we can move diagonally. Only he can do that.
1 : Yeah, but since he ain't here
3 : Ok, he's not there. Ok
2 : But he's not here, so no one can move diagonally
2 : Yeah, cause I'm thinking, she's-
3 : Um
2 : would probably have to move onto yours,
1 : Yeah, well I got three of these, yeah, so we should try to cash that in.
2 : and then give you that card, yeah.
2 : That's what I said, just give you that card.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Um
1 : doesn't really matter- Or, I have five, I guess, so I gotta get rid of one later.
2 : But
2 : yeah, so
1 : Alright
2 : But there's really nothing-
1 : Which co- you're this one?
2 : Should I move, yeah, should I move somewhere?
1 : Uh, you can do one, two, and then action, flip, three, if you want.
3 : Might as well.
2 : Ok
1 : Doesn't really matter.
2 : One, two, and then someon's gonna flip that.
1 : Cool.
2 : Alright, and that's my turn and then I have to pick two of these, hopefully it's not- Oh, of course it is!
2 : Perfect, alright.
1 : Great
2 : So that's my five cards
2 : and then I have to shuffle these.
1 : And then move this one up, yeah.
3 : And then
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, just one
3 : And then you have to get three
1 : Oh yeah
2 : And then I have to pick three
2 : of the ones I just shuffled.
2 : Iron Gate,
2 : Temple of the Moon,
1 : Iron Gate's gone
2 : it's right there.
1 : Temple- Where is Temple of the Moon?
2 : Right there, and Breaker's Bridge,
2 : which is right here.
1 : Oh
1 : shoot.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok my turn
2 : Now we have to strategize you because
1 : So you should give me the green
2 : you have to
2 : Well, she has to move on your tile first.
3 : I can't give you anything.
1 : Oh right
2 : Well if you're on the tile you can.
3 : Well he has five cards.
1 : Well, I can dis- I think I can discard once I get it, I believe.
2 : Well he can discard
2 : cause it says if you have more
2 : than five, if you give him a card he has to immediately get rid of a card.
1 : (--)
3 : But like why would you wanna get rid of like one of these cards, cause they're the ones that you're trying to get
1 : (--)
1 : (--)
3 : you're stocking up on.
3 : You know what I mean? Like one, two, three, we wanna get to one person.
2 : Ye-
2 : Right
1 : Or I can discard this, cause we only have two so far.
2 : Yeah
3 : That's true.
1 : Yeah.
2 : Cause there's like a lot of these in here, so, it'll probably pop up again
3 : Ok
1 : Mhmm
3 : Oh where am I? I'm the blue one.
1 : Yeah, so you want me to just like, move me, move you onto this?
3 : Yeah
1 : Alright
1 : So that's one
2 : So that would be one,
3 : One
2 : and then two would be giving that to him,
1 : and then I'll-
1 : Yeah, I'll take that. And then I'll discard
1 : uh, this one, alright
2 : The red one, because we have three purples on the board,
3 : The fire
1 : Got it
2 : so,
1 : so that's
1 : three, or that was two moves, right? Move past
2 : That was two
1 : You got
2 : And then
3 : And then I'll unflood something
2 : Yeah and then you can shore
1 : Yeah that sounds like a good idea.
2 : Well, you should probably-
2 : No
1 : Yeah, no, go for it, go for it
2 : Yeah, that, yeah that one's fine.
3 : Right
3 : Oh
2 : Cause if that sinks, you guys can just swim
3 : We can go wherever we want
1 : Right
2 : Yeah
3 : And then two of these
1 : Yup
3 : and Sandbag.
2 : And then three flood cards.
1 : Three kinda sucks
2 : Sorry guys- Oh, that was four
3 : Whispering Garden,
1 : Alright
3 : Cliffs of Abandon, there's some right here- Oh is that gone?
1 : Cliffs
1 : I think it's this- Oh did we
3 : Oh I don't know
1 : like get rid of the card there? Alright
2 : Yeah, I was giving them to her.
3 : Yeah
1 : Cool
3 : And Lost Lagoon.
1 : Um, here we go
2 : Alright, now
1 : So I should probably cash that in, and that's probably one, two
2 : Eh
2 : I was gonna say, yeah you have to get to a tile
1 : Hmm
1 : But then I can't like
1 : uh
1 : what's it called, shore up
3 : Un-
3 : Yeah
1 : or whatever.
2 : Well,
2 : I can shore up
1 : Right, but I'm afraid- Or actually, cause I'm not gonna draw these right once they're in there, yeah so I guess I'll go for
2 : Unless you draw a Water Rise card then you're
2 : (--) do that
1 : Yeah, ok
1 : Um
1 : well I mean, these don't really matter I guess, so I'll go ahead
3 : Well why don't you shore up
3 : and
1 : Uh, well, cause I would have to move
2 : Wait, does claiming a treasure count as a move?
1 : I thought so, yeah, capture a treasure
1 : is an action, yeah.
2 : Oh, ok
2 : Well,
2 : if you
2 : Hmm
3 : Because
1 : Where's the other one? There's one- and that's the other, yeah
2 : Well if you just do the treasure,
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I can shore up both of these
3 : Well why don't you shore up two cards, and then your second move will be here, and your third move will be- Oh well you have to cash it in.
2 : But then you can't cash it in.
1 : Yeah
1 : We'll just cash it in anyways.
2 : Well, I was gonna say, you can cash it in on your next turn.
1 : Yeah
1 : uh
2 : Like just move on the tile
1 : Mm
3 : But, like, what if he gets like, on this turn he gets more like, then he can't keep them, cause he has already so many.
1 : I feel like the faster we cash in the better.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, we'll go for it.
1 : Right
2 : Let's do it.
1 : One, two,
1 : cash this in, so discard I think?
2 : Ye
3 : Ss- Discard it.
1 : Yeah, let's just discard it, that would make sense.
2 : Yeah
1 : And take this, or should I just like put it on to the side?
3 : And that, just keep that, yeah
2 : Yeah, just keep it
2 : Keep it by your, yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Cool
1 : Uh, so that's one, two, three actions
2 : And then
2 : so that was three
2 : and then two
1 : Yeah two of those
2 : treasure cards.
3 : (--)
2 : Just don't get a rise up card, ok, yay.
1 : Ah don't- Ay, let's go!
1 : And then, three
1 : Temple,
3 : of the Sun
1 : Temple of the Sun,
3 : Right here
1 : uh, Crimson Forest,
2 : Up there.
1 : Copper Gate.
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
3 : So nothing sank.
2 : That's good.
1 : That's it.
2 : Ok,
2 : so,
3 : Your turn.
1 : You're t- You're like the gray one, right?
2 : Uh
2 : Yeah
3 : I think the next turn I might give you one of these.
1 : Yeah and then
1 : uh
2 : Yeah, cause I have two of these.
3 : Yeah
1 : Wait, you're the Messenger, right?
2 : Yeah, I can give away any of my cards at any time but I mean that doesn't help when I have two.
1 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : But, yeah, you got two already, and you're close to this,
1 : so
2 : Well, I could
2 : I don't know
2 : I was trying to find the most efficient way to get on the same
2 : square
2 : as one of you guys,
2 : but we also need to shore up
1 : Mm
2 : all these tiles.
3 : Yeah, I think this one, we should definitely I think
3 : shore up.
2 : Yeah
2 : Go ahead sh-
1 : Uh
3 : Do you want to?
2 : Cause we nee- That has a thingy on it, like an icon, so we can't lose that card.
2 : Or we can't lose that tile.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Then again we still have that too, but
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah we could go for this one, like if you give me two of those I would have a three
1 : and then-
2 : I think I can only give you one per
1 : Oh
1 : Um
2 : Can I only give him one?
1 : Maybe
1 : if it's an separate action
2 : I think I- Oh wait,
3 : One per action. If she wants to do two actions then she could give you both.
2 : one per action.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : We could do that.
2 : Ok
3 : But in that case
3 : I might as well give it to her and you would give it to her.
1 : And then
1 : Right- Oh yeah, we could do that as well. So we'd have to flip that.
2 : So, shore up that one as my first one, yeah
3 : A one
1 : Action one
2 : and then
1 : uh
2 : should I shore up another card?
1 : Uh
2 : Cause someone's gonna pick a rise card soon
2 : and then it might
2 : screw us over.
1 : Yeah we might wanna kee- try to keep this one cause it'll be easier to like
3 : It's pretty central for moving.
2 : Yeah,
3 : You wanna shore this one up?
1 : Yeah
2 : yeah, go ahead, shore that one up
2 : and then
1 : That's two and then
2 : I could
2 : mm
2 : I can either shore up another one or I can move
2 : to the actual like
2 : this space.
1 : Yeah
1 : I mean, it's your call, it doesn't really matter I don't think.
2 : Mm
2 : I don't know.
1 : Maybe we can sh-
2 : Should I shore up?
3 : On the next,
3 : well on the next- Yeah I think you should shore up, cause on the next one when it comes back to you your first action can be that.
2 : Yeah.
2 : Yeah, go ahead and shore up the- that one.
1 : If for like one of your actions, you can't like take a card, right, you can only give it to someone, I assume?
2 : Yeah, I can only give them.
3 : She can't take a card.
2 : So like, you guys, if you guys give me a card, you still have to be on the same tile as me.
1 : Yeah, I can give a single card.
1 : Mhmm, ok.
2 : So, you guys are gonna have to work your way up
3 : Ok
1 : Oh, I forgot about that.
2 : Yeah
3 : So do you want these now?
1 : Oh, that's gonna be rough.
2 : Yeah
3 : There's a rise up
2 : Eh- I told you it was gonna come up!
1 : Ah great
2 : Alright
2 : One, two, three, four.
2 : Ok, well should I just discard this one, cause we already
3 : Yeah
1 : Two, four
2 : Wait,
3 : We don't need that.
2 : yeah,
2 : and then I have to use the Water Rise
1 : Yeah
2 : So that has to go up one
3 : Oh.
1 : Great
2 : Yay
2 : And then I have to shuffle these
1 : So that means like the ones that showed up
1 : is more likely than- Oh that sucks.
3 : Yeah
1 : Hmm
2 : Oh (--)
2 : Temple of the Sun,
3 : Boom
1 : Oh that's gone.
2 : oh it's gone.
2 : Uh, Crimson
2 : Forest
2 : is
1 : That's alright it's not,
2 : Ah
2 : that's also gone
1 : yeah it's not a big deal.
2 : That's cool, um
2 : Temple of the Moon.
1 : Alright, we should probably keep that one.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Alright, that's not bad
2 : And
3 : That's it right?
2 : if I go for that one
2 : Well-
2 : aw, never mind.
3 : Ok
3 : my turn.
2 : Yeah
3 : Um
3 : I'm on, I'm blue right?
1 : It might be faster to give me the cards cause
3 : She doesn't have that many.
1 : Nah cause it would take us so long to get there to give her the card, you know what I mean?
3 : Well
3 : what do you mean?
1 : But you're only two tiles away so you could give me the card and then
3 : For which one, for which one?
1 : Uh
1 : this one, the lion.
3 : Well,
3 : She's just the next one, right? She just needs the
1 : Right
2 : No, he's saying, but I
1 : but we have to get there, you know what I mean?
1 : That's a lot of time.
2 : Yeah, you guys have to make your way up to me.
2 : But like, if he is down here
3 : Oh, got it.
2 : and you move
2 : two,
2 : and then he moves
2 : like three down here,
3 : And then you would use your two actions
2 : I can give him- Yeah I can use two actions to give him
1 : Mhmm, so we could do it in like the next turn.
2 : two cards.
3 : Ok
3 : Or, ok, so should
3 : my first action be this?
1 : Or you'd have to move onto my square, like
3 : Alright
2 : So you have to use two actions
1 : One, two, and then three.
3 : Two
2 : The only thing is about shoring up
3 : Is that worth it?
1 : Yeah
2 : That's our only
1 : Right, right
1 : Well
2 : I mean, we can wait a turn to do the card switch
1 : alright, so like, we can shore this up, yeah, yeah.
3 : How about if I do one, and then I can give you this maybe?
1 : Uh
3 : Since I'm there.
1 : Yeah
3 : Cause we have three of those.
1 : uh do we have
1 : yeah- Or we have three, I guess we need one more.
1 : I mean we could go for it
3 : Since I'm there, like I can
1 : I'm down
1 : Yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, go for it.
3 : Ok
3 : so I'll do
1 : Or
3 : one
2 : wait
3 : or no
1 : uh
2 : You have to be- To give him a card, you have to be on the same tile as him.
1 : Right
2 : So you still have to move, you
3 : Oh on the same tile, not the same icon.
2 : Yeah, no, so you still have to use two moves to give him any cards.
2 : So I mean if you want to, we can
2 : shore up this turn,
3 : So eh-
3 : I'll shore this up, go here, and then give him this one?
1 : Eh no
2 : No, cause that's four
2 : Or you can just sho-
1 : We should decide if we're going for this or that.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah it doesn't- It's up to you guys, I don't really
1 : have any
2 : Well we could
3 : Well we have three of these on,
3 : on table.
1 : Right.
2 : Yeah, these we don't really have to worry about, cause we can do this at anytime.
3 : And
3 : well the thing is we need a
1 : We only need three uh treasures too
3 : fourth
2 : Yeah, we also only need three treasures to
1 : Yeah
3 : But there's only two of these on
1 : Right
3 : the table, so I feel like
1 : I wonder where it is in the deck.
3 : Cause once this is gone, then like all three of these cards are like
1 : Worthless, right, yeah, no I see what you're saying.
3 : worthless.
1 : Doesn't matter.
1 : I'm cool with either one
2 : We should also shore up
1 : Yeah, you could do like all three shores if you want, like shore- Or I guess I could- I should probably do it cause I'm more
2 : Two
2 : Do-
2 : Well
2 : if you,
2 : if she shores up all three of these,
2 : and then
2 : you
1 : Move to her spot and then give her the card, yeah that sounds good, let's do that.
2 : move to her
2 : and then, yeah, and then give her the card, cause either of you can get the cards, it doesn't matter.
1 : Sounds good.
3 : Ok
2 : So, why don't you shore up
2 : and then he can come to you?
1 : Got it.
2 : And I can give you cards, cause I can give cards whenever.
1 : Good idea.
3 : Ok
2 : So we'll just switch it and you'll just go get the treasure.
3 : Alright, so is it ok if he gives me the card and like I have to get rid of like a bunch of stuff?
2 : Um
1 : Yeah I mean,
1 : yeah,
1 : or we could use it you know?
2 : Well, you only- Uh
3 : You know what I'm saying?
1 : Using's not a bad idea
2 : Yeah, you can use a Sandbag
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Wait, does, using a Sandbag does not count as a turn, right?
1 : Right
1 : Uh
2 : So you can use a Sandbag now if you want,
2 : since on the next turn
1 : Or
1 : nah let's do it at three
3 : It doesn't count as-
1 : Oh but you have to do it on your turn.
3 : It doesn't count as an action and I can play it at anytime, I don't have to do it on my turn.
2 : Yeah, it doesn't count.
1 : Um
3 : So if that's a scenario than I can use it then.
2 : Well he would be next
2 : so you would have to use it now.
3 : How about I do one, two, I shore up
1 : Mmhmm
3 : and then I just move here
3 : so you have to only move once,
1 : It doesn't matter.
2 : So shore up those two, and then
3 : instead of twice.
3 : And then I'll move over, so like meeting halfway.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, I'm cool
2 : as long as this one gets shored up.
2 : cause we need that, that one can't sink, yeah.
3 : Wanna do that?
1 : Yeah, I'm fine with that.
3 : Ok
3 : One,
3 : two,
3 : and then I'll move here.
1 : Cool
3 : And then I pick two of these
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok, I needa use these Helicopter Lifts
3 : (--)
1 : I wonder if you'll- Oh you have si- two, four, si-
3 : Ok, let's
2 : Why don't you,
2 : you can move anyone on a Helicopter Lift,
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah.
2 : why don't you move me
2 : down to you guys, that way we're all kind of in a central location.
1 : Yeah that's a good idea.
2 : That way if you need to get to me
2 : or I need to get to you
3 : Sh- Ok, um
2 : You know what I mean?
3 : How about, sh- Do you want to come onto my card?
2 : Yeah, that's fine.
3 : Wanna do that?
2 : Ah
1 : Ah no, have her come to ours,
1 : or one of us, I don't know.
2 : Why don't-
2 : oh wait
2 : Who are we giving these two?
1 : You,
1 : probably.
2 : We're giving
2 : these to me?
1 : Yeah
2 : because if you fly me
2 : down here,
2 : or if you fly me right here
1 : Yeah, we could do that.
3 : We need- Well, yeah, you need to be here so he can give that to you.
2 : Right
1 : Yeah, fly her here.
2 : So fly me here.
3 : Well, um, this is your turn right?
1 : Are we allowed to do that?
1 : Er
2 : Yeah
1 : Cause we have six
1 : so we kinda have to like
1 : discard and then, I don't know, I don't know.
3 : Um, wait so it's your turn right now?
1 : Nah, it, it, will be mine.
2 : No, it's still your- It's technically still your turn.
3 : Whose- It's my turn right now, oh right, ok.
1 : Yeah
3 : I just got really confused
3 : Um
2 : So, put me here,
2 : get rid of this card,
3 : So I did the Helicopter Lift
2 : and then you can do a Sandbag
3 : Can I just Sandbag
2 : just on the Lost Lagoon.
1 : We can, yeah
1 : yeah, I guess we could do that.
2 : Cause I still have a Sandbag too if we need it.
1 : Sweet
3 : Ok
3 : So
1 : Alright
1 : and then
1 : three,
3 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah
1 : I don't know if you want any of them
3 : One more
1 : Which ones?
3 : Whispering Garden,
1 : We can like just
2 : Lost Lagoon
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : get rid of that, it doesn't really matter.
3 : Breaker's
1 : Breaker's this?
3 : Yeah, that one.
1 : Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Ok
2 : Now, it's your turn.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So I need a card
1 : I'll give you this, that's one.
2 : And then I have to discard
1 : Uh
3 : Or use
1 : Probably discard the fire, yeah.
1 : Cause we have
1 : four of these on, on
2 : yeah, I'm gonna dis- I'm just gonna discard the fire.
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : That's,
1 : that was one move.
1 : Uh, so you, so I gave you that, so I can
1 : go here and
1 : flip that
2 : We-
1 : or here
2 : Yeah, I was gonna say, go right there,
2 : Oh wait yeah, or up there, it doesn't matter.
1 : Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
1 : Yeah
2 : Actually, yeah, go up, because we were eventually wanna get to there.
1 : Yeah.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Now that was three, that's three moves. Card, move, flip, yup.
2 : Right
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Can you pass me two of those?
2 : Don't get a rise card. Yes! You didn't get a rise card.
1 : Oh wow, two fires, great, whatever.
2 : Oh, well, that's ok.
1 : And then three
1 : of these.
1 : Um
1 : Tidal Palace,
1 : Yeah
1 : we don't need that one.
1 : Copper Gate,
2 : It's up there
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Alright
1 : Uh, yeah, yeah that's it
2 : Ok
1 : Your turn
2 : I should probably use
2 : a Sandbag
1 : Mmhmm, yeah, I agree.
2 : on the Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : Uh, yeah, yeah
2 : because we need that.
2 : So I'm just- But that
3 : Why do we need that?
1 : Cause it's like central, it's like-
2 : Because if it sinks, it's like a central like
1 : Yeah we wanna keep like the middle- Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : So that's, that's, that's not an action, alright.
2 : But that doesn't count, that doesn't count as an action.
1 : Um
2 : Um
1 : so which one are you? The gray
2 : Yeah
3 : So I think
3 : I should at one point get all of these.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
3 : Right?
3 : But I need to get rid of cards first so
2 : Well do you wanna use-
2 : Wait, where do I need to be?
3 : I can use a Helicopter card right now,
3 : but I don't
1 : You can just chill out
2 : Well do you wanna
3 : I-
1 : Yeah
2 : Do you wanna use a Helicopter card and
2 : put me here?
3 : So you can
2 : That way I don't have to
2 : move anywhere, and that's one less action
3 : On the next turn?
3 : Yeah, I can do that.
3 : So, how many actions have you done so far?
1 : Zero
2 : Acutally wait,
2 : use that on yourself
2 : because I still need this card from you
2 : and that'll take away one less action,
2 : cause you have to move on my tile.
3 : Alright
2 : So yeah, use that and put yours
1 : Right
1 : The Pilot can fly anywhere, anyways, right?
2 : Oh yeah
1 : Isn't that one of the things
3 : Yeah,
3 : I can go anywhere, yeah.
1 : Right
2 : Yeah
1 : Um, I mean, there's not-
2 : Uh
1 : There's not that much to do.
3 : So it's never a really useful for me to use a Helicopter Lift on myself
2 : No
1 : Uh, well it takes away an action I guess but I mean
1 : besides that, yeah.
1 : Um
2 : yeah if you don't wanna use an action to get somewhere
1 : Yeah,
1 : but there's- I don't think there's much you can do.
1 : Or I guess you can give her the card now, right, two, four, five, yeah
3 : Basically, I want to use one
2 : Well she-
2 : yeah, so we don't waste it.
3 : If I,
3 : yeah.
3 : Cause I don't wanna get rid of this, this, or this.
1 : You can get rid of the Helicopter, I mean it's not a big deal
3 : So
1 : Didn't- Yeah
2 : So yeah, do the Helicopter and just put me there
1 : Wait, but I think- Uh do you have to be on your turn to use that?
2 : No
3 : No, it says play at any time.
1 : No?
1 : Ah sweet, yeah then use that
2 : So then that's
2 : me here
1 : And then
2 : and then
3 : You still haven't done any actions yet.
1 : Yeah, and you should give her the,
1 : the egg.
2 : Yeah, and then I'm gonna
2 : give you that
2 : and that counts as one of my actions
1 : Mhmm, I mean that's all that you can do.
2 : And I don't really need to do anymore actions,
1 : Yeah, you're fine.
2 : cause you guys
1 : Yeah, we good, we good.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, because you have to give me a card, but you can fly anywhere,
3 : Yeah
2 : so you can just fly down to me and give me the card, ok.
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah so let's try to get this after that.
2 : Yeah
1 : That's- That'd be three.
2 : Ok
2 : Actually
1 : Oh wow you would get
3 : Well then
1 : that
1 : Sweet
1 : Um
2 : Wait I can't go back and do actions after I- No ok, so I'll just wait on the next turn.
1 : Nah
3 : Ok
1 : Eh
2 : So then you guys can just automatically start going for that then.
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : Alright, so it's my turn
2 : Well I have to pick three
1 : Yeah
1 : three
3 : Oh you need three of those.
2 : One, two, three.
2 : Caves of Shadows, which is this one,
1 : We don't need
1 : that.
2 : Um, Dunes of Deception, right here,
2 : and Silver Gate,
1 : There's a Copper Gate and a Silver Gate?
2 : up there.
1 : Got it
2 : Yeah
2 : And an Iron Gate, isn't ther an Iron- There was an Iron Gate.
3 : And a Gold one
1 : Oh there's a Bronze Gate, I like the
2 : There's like a million gates
1 : Ah, the gates have like the person- I don't, I don't know what the gates are.
2 : Ok
1 : Uh
2 : so I'm- now I'm done. Now, it's your turn. Don't pick a Water Rise card.
2 : Whatever you do
1 : Um
3 : Um, I legit don't even need this
2 : Well, you could just
3 : So, um
2 : So now
2 : Tr-
2 : Oh crap
2 : Um
2 : Wait
3 : We need to be on-
1 : I think you move,
2 : You should shore up
1 : I think, yeah, your move
3 : Yeah, can we shore this one up?
2 : because you still have to give her your card, and you guys are still on the same tile, so I wouldn't move anywhere if I was you.
3 : Yeah, we need to stay on the same tile.
3 : Yeah
2 : I would just shore up
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, go ahead.
1 : That's one
2 : and just have that as your only action.
1 : (yeah)
1 : and then,
1 : and then probably move here so you're closer to this.
2 : Well you two need to be on the same
3 : We need to be on the same card for this
1 : Well I can move there and then give you the card, yeah.
2 : Oh that's true.
2 : Cause yeah, cause you can move here and you can shore up
1 : Yeah
3 : Alright, for me to like
2 : Yeah, so just
3 : That's me
1 : I think you're blue, or- yeah, yeah, alright, cool.
3 : Yeah
2 : So then you
3 : That was two?
1 : That was two
2 : Yeah
2 : I mean, you don't have to take three- You could shore up if you wanted.
1 : I mean I guess you,
1 : you can shore up.
3 : Why not?
3 : Mm
3 : It doesn't matter
3 : Or which ones are
1 : Alright, yeah, that's cool.
1 : It-
3 : are both of those new?
2 : Yeah, they're both in there.
1 : Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
1 : That's three
1 : So, two of that
2 : Uh
3 : Do we need any of them?
1 : You can get rid of em both.
3 : Right?
3 : Well we're definitely getting- I can definitely get rid of this one.
1 : Oh, yeah, yeah.
2 : Yeah, you can get rid of that and then
3 : I
2 : took the fire one.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah.
1 : Alright
1 : and then three.
1 : What happens if you run out of these?
2 : I have no idea.
3 : You should probably just shuffle those.
1 : Um
2 : We should probably look that up.
1 : Howling Garden, uh
3 : That's Whispering.
1 : Oh, that one,
1 : this one's turned.
1 : Uh
3 : Cave of Embers
1 : Cave of Embers, yeah.
3 : This one.
1 : And then Bronze
1 : so this one.
1 : Alright, then your turn's over.
2 : And then it's your turn now.
1 : Uhuh
2 : so you have to move to her.
1 : um
1 : Right
2 : And then you have to give her a card.
1 : One,
3 : Should I get rid of
1 : two,
2 : just get rid of the fire,
1 : Yeah
2 : cause you need the Helicopter to get off the island.
1 : That's two
2 : And then she can shore up
1 : Uh
2 : for your third one if you wanted to.
1 : Yeah, yeah, we definitely should.
1 : Three.
3 : Ok
1 : Can you pass me two?
2 : Ah, I knew that was gonna happen.
1 : Alright
1 : the Helicopter and and this Water Rise, yeah.
2 : You have to use that one,
2 : which we're still at three, so, you could just move that up one.
1 : Oh alright, I guess it's not a-
2 : And then shuffle all those, aw
1 : Yeah so we gotta make sure this doesn't come up.
2 : I'm gonna need you to shuffle those really well
1 : It's like all after the sh- uh oh, cause I'm drawing three afterwards right?
2 : Yeah
2 : This is rough guys
1 : Let's go
2 : Wait, can I- Oh, never mind.
1 : I can't really, ah there's no Sandbags.
2 : Where did the-
3 : Just,
1 : eh
2 : Yeah, I used my Sandbag. It's ok.
3 : just take three
1 : Alright
1 : if we draw these two, we're kind of screwed.
1 : One,
1 : two,
1 : uh three, alright, that's not bad, that's (--)
2 : Ok
1 : Whispering Garden's out,
2 : That's fine as long as this one didn't go.
1 : Yeah
3 : Breaker's Bridge, I just turned over.
1 : Alright, and then the Dunes.
1 : Alright, my turn's over.
2 : Ok
1 : Alright, so you have
2 : Uh,
1 : four right?
2 : so I'm gonna
2 : do this as one of my moves,
1 : Mhmm, definitely.
2 : so that's that.
2 : These can all go in discard
1 : Yeah, you don't really have to shore up on that, cause it's
3 : Yeah, I don't think it needs to be shored up to do that
2 : No, and then I'm gonna use my s- Oh wait, you already have four of those.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : that was only one right?
1 : Yeah- I guess we can ma- start moving towards the Fool's Landing.
2 : Well, I can just move up one
1 : Uh huh
2 : and then I can just sh- shore up ,
2 : I can shore up this one.
2 : because if you guys sink,
2 : for some reason, you need to go somewhere.
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright, yeah good idea. That's three.
2 : Ok,
2 : that was three.
2 : So now
1 : So
2 : I'm done,
1 : two treasures
2 : which is kind of useless but that's ok.
2 : And then three.
2 : One, two, three.
2 : Bronze Gate is gone,
1 : Bronze is gone.
2 : Copper Gate,
1 : That's gone.
2 : and
2 : Cave of Embers is also gone.
3 : Bye
1 : That's gone
2 : That's fine.
3 : Eh yeah, my turn.
1 : And you're up.
3 : For-
3 : so can I do this?
2 : So if it's your turn you have to move there first
3 : I need to move
2 : as one.
1 : Yeah, and then collect it
3 : One
3 : Oops, sorry.
2 : And then that's- Oh sorry. That's two.
1 : So that's two moves
2 : And then shore up
1 : Uh, or actually you don't- Nah, don't shore up.
2 : Are you sure?
1 : Yeah
1 : cause if it floods, it'll be like a free move to here for me.
2 : Oh that's true.
1 : We have three treasures right? Yeah, just fly to- Yeah
2 : Uh, you could fly, yeah fly yourself to Fool's Landing.
3 : Sorry.
3 : Uh
3 : that's three.
1 : Yeah, that's three, right, yeah.
2 : How much time do we have left?
1 : (--)
3 : Uh
2 : Can we ask that?
1 : I don't know, I wish there was like a clock.
2 : Can we ask that?
2 : How much time?
3 : There's like a six
3 : right there.
2 : Oh, we have six minutes left. Ok, let's go.
1 : Oh, shoot.
1 : Oh, I din't see that.
3 : Ok, so I got Sandbag and this.
2 : Ok
1 : Uh oh
3 : And I need three of those.
2 : So, yeah
2 : One, two, three.
1 : Yeah, so we just have to rush towards Fool's Landing.
2 : Which we can both make it in one move- in one turn.
3 : Uh
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Gone.
1 : Make sure they don't flood.
2 : That's fine.
3 : Silver Gate,
2 : Mm it's up there.
1 : That's gone
2 : and the Lost Lagoon's back here.
1 : Oh yeah
2 : So you
3 : Nope I lied
1 : My turn.
2 : Yeah, you just move two over
1 : One,
1 : two,
2 : And then
1 : Um
2 : You don't,
2 : you don't have to take a third action if you don't want to.
1 : Alright
2 : You get two of those and then pick three of these.
1 : Oh, I have to discard two, four, five,
1 : six.
3 : Get rid of those
2 : Yeah, just get rid of (--)
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Ah I'm so sorry
3 : You're fine.
2 : Just throwing cards at people.
1 : Alright
1 : This turned
1 : Tidal Palace is gone,
1 : Cave of Shadows
1 : is turned.
1 : Alright,
2 : Alright
2 : and that's it, so
2 : One, two
2 : and then
2 : Wait
1 : Can you use our Helicopters- nah you can't, I don't think so.
3 : (--)
2 : No- The Helicopters can be used at any time, so like
2 : do we win?
3 : Ok, say that was one, two, three, four
1 : Alright, wait, let's just look up winning.
1 : Um winning the game
2 : Oh wait, winning the game
3 : Maybe you need to finish your turn.
2 : That's what I was wondering, if I needed to finish my turn or not.
3 : Yeah
3 : I think
1 : I mean there's no way we can like lose
2 : Yeah, that's true, I can just- I'll finish my turn and then you can just use it.
1 : Alright, yeah.
2 : Uh, except for when you get a Water Rise card. That's ok.
2 : And I have to pick four.
2 : I guess I can
1 : It seems like you can win like now, but I don't know, what you're- Yeah.
2 : Can I win- Oh, it doesn't really matter.
2 : So, let's see. Dunes of Deception,
1 : Mhmm
2 : Breaker's Bridge is gone,
1 : Alright.
2 : Temple of the Moon is gone,
2 : and Lost Lagoon is gone.
1 : Oh wow
3 : Oh wait
2 : What?
3 : Oh, ok
1 : Yeah, we're good. And then you're turn.
2 : So now it's your turn
3 : And then I just have to use a Helicopter Lift card.
1 : Yeah, I think we're done.
2 : And we're, we're done.
3 : To move everyone outta here.
2 : We won.
1 : Ay
2 : Ay, look at us go!
1 : Ay
2 : We're killing it guys!
3 : Woohoo!

2 : Ok
1 : Ok I start
1 : and
1 : I'm gonna shore up Whispering Garden
1 : and
1 : Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Wait, you have to be adjacent to it right?
1 : Oh wait, I have to be next to it, yeah.
2 : Yeah, cause you could do two, but they still have to be next to you.
1 : Ok, I'll do the Lost Lagoon
1 : and
1 : I'll move
1 : one place over
1 : and
1 : um
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : p-
1 : this place.
1 : Ok
1 : I think that was three actions.
1 : So now draw two Treasure Deck cards.
2 : Yeah
1 : Thank you
1 : Oh man,
1 : got a Water's Rise card
1 : So
1 : It went to two.
1 : So I
1 : discard that,
1 : and
3 : And then I think you gotta shuffle
2 : No
2 : um
1 : Oh
3 : Those
2 : Oh, oh
1 : These should probably
1 : not even be here though, if we just started,
1 : so
1 : I'll just
2 : Or did you guys put those there? Ok
1 : Oh ok, they're meant to be there
3 : Ok
2 : Ok so we gotta shuffle and put those on top.
1 : Shuffle them
1 : Oops
2 : Ok
1 : And pick two
1 : So Cliffs of Abandon and Lost Lagoon.
1 : Oh no!
2 : Oh no!
1 : Already!
2 : Oh
1 : Ok
1 : Here we go
2 : Mm
2 : what cards- What treasure cards do you have?
2 : Ok
2 : Wait how did you get three?
1 : Two fire and-
1 : Um cause I just
2 : Oh
2 : yeah
1 : picked, ok
2 : duh
2 : ok
2 : So
1 : Ocean's
2 : What am I gonna do, I don't
2 : um
2 : I don't know I can't really do anything useful, so I guess I'll just move.
2 : So
2 : Cool
2 : And then
2 : Flood cards
2 : Whispering Garden and Phantom Rock
1 : Oh you have to shuffle this one don't you?
2 : No that's only whenever you draw a Water's Rise card right?
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh, ok
2 : Oh no we lost Phantom Rock!
1 : No
1 : Oh no
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
3 : um
3 : hmm
3 : sh
3 : I don't really know what I should do
2 : Do you guys maybe wanna pick one treasure and just sorta like aim for it?
2 : Or do you think it'd be better-
2 : cause I mean like we got two
1 : S
1 : two, two, two
3 : Yeah
1 : So we have to get three of four let's just stick with maybe these three for now, but
1 : then again like, he could always-
3 : Ok
2 : Why don't we try and focus on the next treasure that we get the third card for, how does that sound?
3 : Yeah
3 : alright well
2 : Cause we need four right?
1 : Ok
3 : I'm gonna fly over here,
3 : and then shore up Whispering Garden cause it might-
1 : Mm
3 : We might draw that again and lose it.
2 : Good idea
1 : Good call
3 : And then
3 : um
2 : So was that- That was two moves?
1 : Mm
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : And then
3 : I guess I'll just shore up Lost Lagoon as the third one
2 : Can you do that diagonally though?
1 : It's- He's right here.
3 : I'm blue, yeah
2 : Oh, duh, yeah you're blue.
3 : And then, so I draw
3 : two of these
2 : You're red, you're blue, ok.
3 : Ok, Helicopter Lift,
3 : and fire.
1 : Nice
2 : Cool
3 : And then
3 : draw two flood cards,
3 : so I got Golden Gate,
3 : and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : You're on Breaker's Bridge
3 : Oh
2 : Don't break the bridge
1 : Put your swimming trunks on
2 : So that one-
1 : Ok
1 : So I'm definitely gonna
1 : shore up this guy
1 : and
1 : ok, um
3 : I think you have to be on the same tile if you wanna like trade cards with someone.
1 : Right, unless you're the Messenger.
1 : Um
2 : You could,
2 : you could move onto his tile and then trade him the card, would that- Cause you have two actions left.
3 : Yeah if you give em to me
1 : Oh, that's true
3 : then I have the bonus of being able to fly wherever.
1 : Can I give you two cards though?
2 : But can you
3 : I wanted to like
2 : Can you give two cards or is the other way-
3 : Uh,
3 : give a single card. I guess in
3 : Each card is an action
2 : We can wait until his turn and you could
1 : Ok, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna,
3 : I think
1 : I'm gonna
1 : take another turn and go here.
1 : Ok, two treasure
3 : Cool
1 : Can you get me two treasure cards?
1 : Thank you.
1 : Alright
1 : and I have five now.
1 : And
1 : I need two
1 : so ok
1 : Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate
1 : are now flooded.
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah, ok
2 : Um
2 : K so I can give my cards to anyone but I can't- But I can only take them from people I'm standing on the same tile as.
2 : Um
1 : Um (--)
2 : Does your, does your ability count as a turn? Because I could do one,
2 : two, switch with him for a third action, then use my ability to give it to her.
2 : Can I do that?
1 : Wait what?
2 : Does using your ability count as an action?
3 : Mm
3 : Mm,
1 : I don't think so
3 : yeah, I don't think
1 : No
2 : So I could do
2 : one move
2 : No, you're red.
2 : Dammit, ugh
1 : But I am on the Ocean Chalice, so if you gave that to me, that would
3 : Mmhmm
1 : like
1 : raise our chances, um
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, I was just thinking for the red one, but
1 : But we only have two
2 : Ok
1 : the red one.
2 : Yeah, cause
1 : The fire,
1 : the fire chalice
2 : Yeah, cause if he can give that to you, then we can
2 : yeah cause, you could move here.
1 : A single card
2 : Can you give-
2 : Oh, per action, ok so it does count as an action.
3 : Ok
1 : Oh
2 : Ok
2 : my mistake.
2 : Um,
2 : you've already got five cards though, you have to discard one.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : You could discard the lion though, so you could have two of these.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
2 : I mean does that sound good?
1 : Sure
2 : Alright
2 : so one,
2 : two, and then, here,
2 : three.
1 : Discard this please
2 : Oh, and then
2 : draw f-
1 : Did you pick treasure cards?
2 : I did not.
1 : Ok
2 : Ah no!
1 : Mm
2 : Shuffle
2 : Ok,
2 : and then draw
2 : three
2 : I think we already lost Breaker's Bridge, didn't we?
2 : No, you're on it right now.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok so we lost Iron Gate,
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : gets flooded
1 : Oh no Temple of the Moon
2 : And
1 : right here.
2 : Ok so we need-
2 : Everybody try and
3 : (--)
2 : keep Temple of the Sun, we need that one.
1 : Right,
3 : Ok
1 : that's our last Earth chalice
1 : or whatever
3 : Alright,
3 : um
3 : I guess I will
3 : fly over here, hang out with you guys,
1 : Party!
3 : and flip this over,
3 : and also
3 : give you my fire treasure card, and then your turn you can just like move over to the Cave of Shadows and
1 : Mmhmm
2 : You have to discard one now too though.
1 : Ok
3 : And then, so I draw two treasures
3 : Do do do
1 : No that's green.
3 : Earth and sandbags
2 : Sweet
1 : Nice
3 : Now I have five
3 : and
3 : ok.
1 : And now flood cards equal to the water level.
3 : Cool
1 : (--)
3 : It says three?
2 : Mm
1 : Mm
3 : One
3 : Lost Lagoon, Whispering Garden, and
1 : Not quite
3 : Howling Garden.
1 : Not lost.
2 : Howling Garden,
2 : Whispering Garden, what was the third one?
1 : Ok, both gardens are
3 : Lost Lagoon
2 : Ok
1 : Oh man
1 : Alright
2 : So you have four you can move here and get the, the red one.
1 : Right
3 : Yeah, I would recommend like flipping that over first.
1 : And then moving back
1 : I, I have three actions so
3 : Yeah
1 : I wonder
1 : if taking this counts as an action. Are you re- Are you done?
2 : Yeah
2 : Capture a treasure if you discard, that's, that's one action.
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Put that here
2 : So you could,
2 : you could move for your first action,
3 : (--)
2 : get the treasure card for your second one,
1 : Ok,
1 : so
1 : discard these?
1 : Got one
2 : Yay!
1 : And then,
1 : so that's one action.
2 : No that's two.
1 : That was two?
2 : Cause you had to, you had to move first right?
3 : Oh man
1 : And then taking this was an action
2 : Yeah, number four.
1 : Oh
3 : Oh
2 : So, for my next turn I could
2 : use my three actions to move, move and then shore up.
3 : Yeah
1 : I'm gonna move here.
1 : Well,
1 : let me think.
1 : I'm gonna move here.
3 : Ok
1 : for my last action, and then
2 : Yeah, cause- Oh you can shore, you can shore up a
1 : two treasure cards.
2 : You can shore up card
2 : tiles you're adjacent to, I forgot about that. So you could
2 : do Howling Garden if you want.
1 : Mm
1 : k
1 : Copper Gate,
1 : Crimson Forest,
1 : um,
1 : and
1 : Cave of Embers.
1 : oh my gosh.
2 : We can lose Cave of Embers if we need to though, cause we already have that one.
3 : Yeah we do have that treasure.
1 : Yeah we should like focus on like these four, since they're close by each other
3 : Yeah
1 : Does that make sense?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Cause these three are like-
3 : Well if you stay there, you're perfect, cause you can shore up diagonally.
1 : Right
1 : Cool
2 : Wait, you can shore up diagonally?
2 : (--)
1 : No, no
3 : Oh
1 : Nope
3 : No she can't, ok.
1 : Yeah
2 : No she can, she can just do two.
3 : Just a (--),
2 : Just in the same direction, but she can just do two.
3 : ok
3 : Oh that's the Explorer, ok.
1 : Mhmm
2 : We don't have one of those.
1 : K, you're turn Messenger.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yes
3 : Alright
2 : So, yeah I'm right here.
3 : I would try to get like that flipped up.
2 : So
2 : you know what, I'm gonna do
3 : Shore it up
2 : Yeah,
2 : so one,
2 : two,
2 : and I can shore up this one- No, I don't really need to though.
3 : Yeah it's kinda just hanging out on the edge.
1 : Right, we're good.
1 : Yeah
2 : I mean, I could, I have one more turn left. Might as well.
3 : Yeah
2 : Can't really use it for anything else.
3 : Unless you wanted to like move somewhere
2 : um
3 : or start moving somewhere.
1 : Right, if you want,
2 : Yeah, wait, where do you think I should move?
3 : Um,
1 : uh,
1 : um,
2 : mm oh I could maybe head for here so we have someone on that one.
1 : What about this one?
2 : True.
2 : Hmm
1 : Maybe you should go here so that he's on the same tile as you so if he wants to give you a card, cause he has t he Earth card, he could give that to you if you're on the same tile.
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, yeah, sounds good.
1 : K
3 : Cool
2 : Three
2 : Oh, and then
2 : draw two
2 : ca- ah
2 : Um
2 : Move it up
1 : It's still on three though?
2 : Yeah
1 : K
2 : Shuffle,
2 : shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.
2 : Put it on top, discard
2 : Yeah, and
2 : one,two, three, four, five,
2 : ok.
1 : Did you
1 : pick these yet? Ok
2 : No, not,
2 : not yet.
2 : Um, yeah
1 : Three
2 : Two
2 : Ok, so, Crimson Forest,
3 : Gone
1 : Outta there.
2 : Gone
2 : Lost Lagoon,
1 : Right here, we lost it.
2 : Gone.
2 : And
2 : Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Ok, cool.
3 : Ok
3 : let's think.
2 : Do you maybe wanna give me your purple thing?
1 : So remember
3 : Yeah
1 : The Earth
2 : I can discard that
3 : I'll give you that
1 : (Earth)
2 : Cool, so that's one
3 : And um
1 : Mmhmm
3 : I, also
3 : could
3 : fly us
3 : to
3 : her, if I wanted to. I have two Helicopter Lifts.
2 : Mm, if you-
3 : And then you could- She,
2 : Yeah, if you wanna fly us to there, then on her turn she can give me one and then on my turn I can hop over to the Temple of the Sun and then get that one.
1 : Hmm
3 : She could give you-
3 : Yeah
3 : yeah
3 : I should probably shore up Breaker's
3 : Bridge too.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, well you got three turns so you could shore it up
2 : and then fly us there and then for your third turn give-
2 : No that was me, never mind.
3 : Ok
1 : And then for your third turn, just
3 : Yeah
2 : shore up Howling Garden maybe?
1 : Yeah, shore up Howling Garden.
1 : Yeah,
3 : Yeah
1 : that seems perfect.
3 : Oh this doesn't count as an action either, so that's cool.
1 : Oh, because you are the Pilot?
2 : No, because its a special- It says on the card does not count as an action.
1 : Oh, special action
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh
3 : Oh and I can also shore up any tile I want to on the island, so
2 : Oh, we forgot about that.
3 : Should I like
3 : Sh
1 : Any island or?
3 : Yeah, just any, any tile. Should I do like Howling Garden, or
1 : The one
2 : Mm
1 : Mmhmm, definitely.
2 : Either that or Breaker's Bridge, cause
1 : I mean, Howling Garden is more valuable though, because it has the treasure.
2 : It is
3 : Yeah
3 : I'm next to that too, so I could just shore that up anyway, so
2 : Yeah
1 : Exactly.
2 : That's true.
3 : I'll play sandbags
3 : and shore up that
3 : and
3 : so, I still have two actions left so I'm gonna shore this up.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : That's two.
3 : Um
3 : and then I use this card, I guess
3 : and fly us over here.
2 : Cool
3 : And um
1 : Yeah
3 : Then I guess I'll just
2 : You don't have to do a third thing
1 : Yeah, you, yeah- I feel like it would just be
3 : Uh ok, yeah that's cool, I'll just
2 : Cool
1 : Cool
1 : and then
3 : My turn, draw two of these
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Got a winds, another Helicopter Lift, and I draw three of these, right?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Two,
3 : three.
3 : Alright,
3 : Whispering Garden and Howling Garden,
2 : Oh good thing you shored that up
3 : Yeah
1 : They seem to be going together a lot
3 : And then, Copper Gate is gone
1 : K
1 : My turn.
1 : I'm going to
1 : give you this,
1 : shore up Howling Garden,
1 : and
1 : gonna just
1 : stay where I am.
1 : So
1 : two treasure cards.
1 : Oh my god, nice.
3 : Oh right on
2 : Yes!
1 : Right
2 : Oh wait
3 : You may only have five cards in your hand
2 : One, two, three, four- Oh! Sorry

3 : Oh you-
3 : Yeah
1 : Thanks
1 : Ok
1 : So three
1 : Cave of Embers,
1 : oh ok,
1 : no big deal.
1 : Dunes of Deception,
1 : it's just like a warning, and then Silver Gate.
1 : Ok

2 : Alright
2 : one action,
2 : two actions, and for my third action I'm going to
2 : discard four.
2 : Yeah!
2 : Yes! I got the purple thing
2 : Alright
2 : Excellent
2 : Oh,
2 : yeah and then draw two,
2 : and draw three of these.

2 : Tidal Palace,
2 : and
2 : Bronze Gate.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok,
3 : cool.
3 : Alright, well
3 : for my turn
1 : I strongly recommend
3 : uh
3 : Yeah, I was gonna get that
1 : trying to shore that up.
2 : Yeah
3 : So, I'll move here,
1 : Mmhmm
3 : flip this
3 : over,
1 : Mmhmm
3 : and um
3 : I'm gonna use one of my Helicopter Lifts to fly you there so you can
3 : uh
1 : That's
3 : get the treasure.
1 : I-
1 : I'm red.
3 : Oh you're red? Sorry
3 : So you can get the treasure on your turn
3 : and
1 : Thank you
3 : Eh I guess I'll just end my turn there.
1 : Ok
3 : So, draw two treasures,

3 : Yeah.
3 : Yup
1 : Wait, I'm gonna um
1 : move here and then-
1 : Wait a second, so this is my second action
2 : Can you,
2 : can you, can you shore up the one I'm on?
1 : and this is my third action. Yeah
1 : Cause I can do two at once, if I'm next to them.
2 : Yeah, you can- Ok
3 : (--)
3 : Ok
2 : Because if I sink, then we're, we're done.
1 : K two treasure cards.

2 : so I'm just gonna, for my three turns, I'm just gonna go one,
3 : If you-
3 : oh um,
3 : I was just gonna say if you guys are both on the same
3 : tile
3 : then on my turn I can use my Helicopter Lift,
3 : fly you both to Fool's Landing, and then move myself there and then she can use her lift to get us out of there.
1 : And then we won.
2 : Oh, good idea, good idea, so I'm just gonna do that.
1 : Cool
1 : Mm
2 : Hold on, since it's still my like
3 : Mm
1 : You can technically like
3 : You can still- Yeah you could flip that.
2 : Well I mean I can use my sandbags,

3 : Oh yeah
2 : just cause it doesn't count as a turn, so.
3 : That
2 : Which one should I use? This one?
1 : But we do have at time limit too. Yeah that one, Watchtower.

4 : These are already
1 : Oh I thought that was shored up, sorry

1 : Yeah
3 : Cause I've only used two
2 : Not now
1 : Oh well
2 : Not now, next turn
1 : Is it- what about before or after?
1 : Does it matter if it happened before the treasure?
3 : sh
2 : Um
1 : Let's just wait
1 : C- do you wanna- I don't- it's gonna take a while to find out what that means
2 : Yeah cause I think
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok yeah, good call
1 : Just- you can do it next turn
2 : Well I say just
4 : Alright let's just
2 : Yeah I'd recommend doing that.
3 : Um

2 : Wait
2 : sh
4 : I'll discard this
3 : She doesn't have to discard yet
1 : Well uh
2 : Yeah I'd say um

4 : Um
1 : It'll come back

3 : Yeah
3 : The blue, so you're trying to find
2 : You're trying to get blue so you have to be on a blue
1 : The
1 : So where- I would have to get all the way over there
2 : Yeah
1 : Should I
4 : Yeah
1 : move that way then? Cause I really have nothing else to do
2 : Um you're
2 : Yeah I'd recommend just um move uh

1 : So this would be my second move
2 : Yep and then
3 : Wait why would you move there? Can you not-
4 : And then over

4 : really matter
2 : Like you know so you can go (shoo)

3 : It's two
2 : No that's two turns.
4 : Two
1 : Two
4 : each card counts as one turn
2 : Yeah each turn I can, I can flip this
1 : Ok yeah
2 : And I can stay here
1 : That would be good, that's a really important one.
3 : Might as well
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, so you have the Cave of Embers
4 : I
3 : So I'm on the same
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Don't you need
2 : Yeah, I got them two of these, alright I have three chalices.
1 : Nice
4 : Oh awesome.
4 : Wait where's the chalice?
2 : Um
1 : The last one's there
4 : Wasn't two
2 : Well it's here and then I need to take three of these right?
4 : Ok
1 : He could fly you there.
2 : Yeah I could
2 : Um
3 : Do a lot of flying.
2 : Silver Gate
4 : Well he has like a bunch of Helicopters
2 : Crimson
1 : And he's the Pilot
2 : Crimson Forest
2 : Whispering Gardens
4 : Silver
1 : Silver
4 : Gate
3 : Wait
3 : So
2 : Silver Gate is here.
4 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : We don't need that one. Well, I guess it's a good traveling.
2 : Yeah we don't need the Bronze Gate is what we don't need.
1 : yeah
4 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : So sometime
2 : Alright
4 : Pilot
3 : Already on your
3 : ah
3 : tile I can give you this.
1 : Ok
4 : Yes
1 : So that's one
2 : That's one yeah
1 : And then
3 : Ah
1 : Give him
1 : Oh you can't
1 : That chalice
1 : needs to get to him
2 : Alright we're gonna, we're gonna want to
2 : Ah
2 : We're gonna
3 : keep that so
4 : Where is she, she's here. Do you want to fly?
2 : What?
3 : I could fly the
4 : people
2 : Well to think like alright, alright, I have three chalices she has three Winds
2 : and you have four of this, so we're gonna get this and then we have to decide what's the third one we want
2 : So
3 : Ah
2 : um
1 : If he moves here
1 : and then flip that
2 : Yeah he can
2 : What yeah I mean you might as well
4 : Yeah
3 : Oh God
1 : So that would be the last of your turns, move here
1 : flip that
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : yeah
2 : I mean
2 : We're in a good position to get all four
4 : We still have twenty minutes left
2 : Treasures
1 : I forgot that this was timed.
2 : Coral Palace
4 : Ok
3 : (--)
4 : Dunes of Deception

2 : You you have to discard one of these.
3 : Oh
3 : Can (--)
2 : Alright so
3 : we don't (--)
3 : I don't need this one.
2 : Just yeah, yeah, yeah get rid of that.
4 : You don't need that one yeah.
2 : Alright

4 : Yay. Boom
2 : Alright
2 : and then you have two more
4 : So we have
1 : We only need one more
4 : I might just try to
4 : Oh we need one more.
2 : So wait, wait, wait, is there any way
4 : I can move diagonal
2 : You can't alright you can't give her the card though.
4 : No cause once I get there
2 : You're never, yeah you're not, wait, wait, no, no no use this, use this, move, move fly, fly um
4 : Fly me, fly me
2 : To where to where
4 : Can he use it?
4 : When it's not his turn?
3 : Yeah you can use this whenever
4 : Ok
2 : If then and then if you fly (--)
1 : Fly me there.
4 : and then
1 : You have two
1 : You have two so you could fly me there and fly her there.
3 : True.
2 : raise your
2 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah do them both, do them both yeah.

4 : One, two, three, ok you're good.
1 : Yes
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : And then how many
2 : Do you still have one turn left?
2 : You give the card, you flew and you gave, so yeah move closer to here.
4 : I think so
1 : You could move diagonally maybe
2 : Move to the, move to the it doesn't make a difference.
2 : Yeah or actually if you moved here and then it, it
1 : Yeah move diagonally
4 : Oh yeah
1 : Potential flipping and things ok
2 : It sunk

2 : Yup
1 : There's one.
4 : We have three treasures.
1 : I don't
1 : do anything?
2 : Yeah we're good.

3 : Ok
2 : Yeah we're gonna have to, we're gonna have to wait until
4 : Wait
4 : Is that (--)
1 : I could go one, not that wouldn't be good.
2 : oh
4 : wouldn't it be
2 : Well no you could go it here.
1 : And then if it's flooded we could both swim.
2 : And then if you get a Water Rise right now you can both swim here.
4 : Yeah we want that to be flooded.
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : Nice
2 : Alright so are you done (--)
1 : That was my three turns yes
4 : Mm
2 : Alright so here did you get a Water
2 : Oh
1 : I did ok
4 : Awesome
2 : And another Helicopter that you can use.
3 : (--)
1 : Ok
4 : Oh no
1 : Here we go
2 : Alright so
4 : I hope this sinks so we can swim.
3 : If everyone gets on the same tile we can fly everyone to the Fool's Landing.
4 : yeah
2 : We want the ah
2 : We want the Coral Palace
1 : Oh we're golden.
2 : We want the Coral Palace here.
1 : One
1 : two
2 : still on three
1 : three
1 : Coral Palace
1 : Yay
1 : Cave of Embers as well is gone.
1 : And
1 : Silver Gate
1 : is also gone.
2 : Is also gone alright that's fine.
4 : Oh God
1 : And then that's it
4 : Ar
4 : for your turn ok.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : that
2 : Ok so alright so
3 : so
1 : This Water's Rise as well. Where do we put that? Over there.
3 : That's cause we're here.
4 : Treasure
2 : Oh yeah
3 : You can
4 : K
2 : Ok so it's my turn
3 : You need all three just to get that?
4 : Yeah get close
1 : Three
2 : And then oh you can use one,one of your Helicopter Lifts to fly him here and then we can leave.
1 : Nice.
1 : Ok
4 : Wait
2 : with the other Helicopter Lift
4 : Ok
3 : Yeah yeah yeah
2 : She has two, so just use one and then
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
3 : fly there
2 : And then yeah and then, and then we win.
1 : Let's go
4 : Yay

1 : Just move adjacent once you've sunk
3 : Well yeah, you'd be, you'd be able to swim, so you'd be fine.
2 : Oh ok, yeah, that's true.
1 : Wouldn't matter.
1 : Ok, so first thing I can do would be to shore up
1 : two places. I don't see why not.
1 : So, should I just pick these two?
1 : (Like) we did in the beginning.
2 : Uh, yeah sure
1 : ok
1 : So that's one action.
2 : mmhmm
1 : Uh
1 : I'm also going to move forward,
1 : in front of me,
1 : that's two actions
1 : and then
3 : you can draw Treasure cards
1 : Is it-
2 : Oh she- he gets one more action.
1 : But do I need another action, is that important?
2 : Um, well it's not really going to hurt you if you use the action, so you might as well.
3 : Oh, ok, yeah
1 : Cards do you guys have
2 : Let's see, I have
3 : I mean
3 : you can't really do- you can't give a treasure, you can't capture a treasure, the only thing you can do is
2 : You could, you could just shore up the two adjacent cards, just so that
1 : Yeah
3 : Wait, can you do that again?
1 : Didn't I already do that though?
2 : I don't know if- Oh can you use that?
1 : I th-
1 : Yeah, I can only shore up two tiles for one action.
2 : Yeah, but it doesn't say you can only use it once per turn, so I think that you can use it for a second action.
3 : Can
3 : (--)
2 : Cause like I think if there's a restriction of that sort, it's actually on the card, like for the Pilot's card for example, it says that um
2 : it's once per turn only.
3 : once per turn.
1 : Ok
2 : So since yours doesn't say once per turn, I guess you can do it again.
1 : Would you- Is
1 : that like important to do?
2 : Um, I mean like, if we ac- if we draw one of those, like
3 : Yeah we don't want them to sink.
1 : Ok, alright, I'll (do that then)
2 : Yeah, like it would just, I don't know, like it's not hugely important if they do sink, it's just being isolated
3 : Well we don't, we don't want them to sink regardless.
1 : Ok, so now I need to draw cards. Can you grab
2 : Yeah
2 : mmhmm
2 : Yeah, sure
1 : I think two of them.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Messenger
1 : Alright, Water's Rise and
1 : whatever that is.
1 : Um
2 : Ok
3 : No you have to, nope, nope, nope
2 : Oh wait
2 : Oh yeah, these are still in play, are they?
3 : Shu- shuffle those, yeah, they put them there.
2 : Oh, ok
2 : Wow
1 : I didn't see that
2 : those are significant.
1 : Alright, two cards
2 : Ok
1 : Temple of the Moon, Lost Lagoon
1 : Yeah, so it's where I'm standing on
2 : Ehh
2 : Lost Lagoon
2 : (does anyone) see it?
3 : It's right here.
2 : Oh
3 : y-
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, now we put them face up
2 : then discard Water's Rise and the Treasure card, yeah
3 : Discard- Here, give me that
3 : Water's Rise.
2 : There it is
1 : So, now it's your turn Messenger
2 : ok
2 : Ok
2 : yeah
2 : So, yeah, first I take three actions
1 : What is our plan of action, before we start keep-
3 : Um
1 : I see a lot of pieces right here and it's also really close to this.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Wouldn't it be important that we
1 : be
1 : around that area?
1 : Is it really- I don't think it's important for us to be separated.
2 : It's not super important to spread out but
2 : we should at least try to put ourselves close to the Treasure card that we need.
3 : Well we should-
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Teasure spaces I mean.
1 : What are we close to?
2 : Ok, well we're close with the chalice and we're close with the fire thing. I'll just hold onto this for now, since you're close to the maximum card limit.
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : let's see, so
2 : yeah
2 : See I can move
2 : Now which one should I
3 : You can shore that up
2 : Oh that's right, cause I'm close to it, so might as well do that.
2 : (so) there's one
2 : then I can-
2 : Let's see, I can either move or exchange. So I guess what I'll
2 : do is I'll move two spaces, since I have two actions left.
3 : Can you, can you move more than once?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Oh
2 : Yup
2 : Let's see, so that would be one action, and then two. Let's see, where do I wanna get close to?
2 : Should I try to position myself cent- closer to the center of the board or
2 : should I get to Whispering Gardens?
2 : (of) course, since I can give, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for me to
1 : Don't come where I am, because it's gonna be flooded soon
2 : Ok
2 : So I guess what I'll do is I'll move one to here
2 : one action, two actions
3 : Ok
2 : K, and then, let's see. And draw two Treasure
3 : Two Treasure cards
2 : Ok so I have the wind thing and sandbags
2 : and then I draw flood cards, so it's at two right now.
2 : So I can draw two flood cards
2 : and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : and Golden Gate
2 : are being flooded.
2 : I'm standing on Cliffs of Abandon, and op, Gold Gate's gone.
1 : ok
2 : Ok
2 : So I'll flip this over
3 : Give me the
3 : yeah
3 : flood card.
3 : Thank you
3 : Ok
2 : K, next
3 : Alright
3 : We should definitely go with these ones cause we- you guys already have two so
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Alright, I don't know, what should I do?
2 : You have two of each.
2 : Um
3 : I'll move here and shore this up.
2 : Ok
1 : That's two actions
3 : And then like,
3 : I don't know.
2 : One more action- Well you could fly yourself somewhere if it would be convenient.
2 : Like uh,
2 : don't think you have any corresponding Treasure cards at the moment, but
3 : Like, no
2 : Like you don't have to move if you
2 : If it won't gain you anything.
3 : I don't know, what do you guys think. Should I do something or like just stay put?
2 : Um, I would just stay since you're between two, two characters and
3 : Ok, yeah, that's true
1 : Yeah
2 : I don't know.
1 : You look good there.
3 : Thanks
1 : Ok
1 : so
2 : Let's see
1 : I guess I'll
1 : I (sho-) what did you get?
3 : This, so you should come get me and then I'll give this to you
2 : Chalice
1 : ok
1 : Ok
3 : at some point.
1 : We can try
3 : Ok and then I need
3 : two of those.
2 : ok
3 : Breaker's Bridge and Phantom Rock, oh dear.
2 : Phantom Rock's gone. Breaker's Bridge
2 : uh, do you see it?
2 : Oh
2 : Thanks
1 : Oh ok
1 : so
3 : Actually, you should probably move here and shore those up.
1 : That's what I was gonna do. So that's one action, this will be another
3 : Ok
1 : and then
1 : why don't I,
1 : why don't I just
1 : well I can't move
2 : mm
1 : Hmm
3 : Wait, you can move again, can't you?
2 : See
3 : Yeah
1 : Well I already moved once, it's one action.
2 : Yeah
3 : Y- you can move again for your another action, didn't we determine that?
2 : Uh
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : You can move
3 : So you could come meet me? and then when it's my turn I could give you
3 : my treasure card?
1 : Sure, sounds good
2 : Yeah, sure
1 : And now I get
1 : two cards,
1 : thank you Messenger.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Alright
3 : Ooo, good things
2 : Ok then
1 : So now I have five cards so I can't take any more than this
2 : No
1 : Whispering Garden and Iron Gate
2 : Iron Gate
1 : That's Bronze Gate
2 : There we go.
2 : Ok
3 : We just gotta like watch this, cause this has a
2 : Mmhmm
3 : um, symbol on it, which is important.
2 : Yeah but there's,
2 : there's a second one though as well.
3 : Yeah I know but if we like end up sinking both of those and we lose the g- well I mean not- I guess like we don't lose cause we can go and get the other ones, but
2 : Yeah, I know what you mean
3 : Not a good thing
2 : Ok
1 : Are we supposed to be moving this up as we go?
2 : Then
3 : No, it's only if you get a Water's Rise card
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah, so then flood it
1 : Oh we're good, we're great.
2 : Ok, then it's my turn.
2 : Ok, so first thing, let's see
2 : I don't have any important cards at the moment
2 : so I'll just hold onto them.
2 : Um
2 : let's see
2 : I can shore up any of-
2 : any one tile on the island
2 : If even if I'm not close to it.
3 : Do you wanna get that guy?
2 : Um
2 : sure, I guess we might as well play it.
1 : Ok
2 : So let's do that, that doesn't count as an action.
2 : And then
2 : let's see, second act-
2 : First action I guess-
2 : Oo
2 : Oh boy.
2 : Um
2 : I don't really see any way to advance or
2 : to advance my position so if there's no useful moves I'll make I'll just refrain from moving.
3 : Like yeah.
1 : Ok so
1 : I have
1 : three of these cards but I have, I have five total, which is bad.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : K so what
1 : But I need you to move
1 : to
1 : whatever this is called.
2 : Ok
3 : Wait now, y- I can't y- I have to you- Since it's my turn, I have to give you your- Like I can't
2 : You-
2 : It's down here
1 : Yeah
1 : You have to be on there
1 : with me.
3 : Yeah, I know, but like ah you can't give me your cards, I have to give you mine. So this is my turn so like I'll give you
1 : I agree
3 : this card. Or wait no, you didn't finish your turn.
1 : I can't
2 : Wait ok, wait a second. I didn't (finish) - I have an idea. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come over to
1 : You're right, you're right.
2 : this tile
2 : and
3 : Ok that's like probably a good idea. Well I'll just be chilling there, it's fine.
1 : Ok
2 : Oh wait,
2 : hold on a second.
1 : Yeah
2 : I just thought
2 : Oh ok, wait a second, I can't take stuff from you, can I?
1 : That's a lot of eggs in one basket
2 : No, cause it's not your turn
1 : No you can't- yeah I could give it to you.
2 : Yeah, never mind- Oh can you give it to me but even though if it's not your turn?
2 : No you can't, that's right, ok
1 : No
2 : Cause I was just thinking we could get rid of that, but that's not gonna work. That's ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah whatever, then I don't
3 : I mean like it's probably fine to be there, we'll just be like hanging out in the same
2 : Yeah, ok, I don't see anymore useful moves to make so. Yup
3 : So Treasure cards
2 : K so I have
2 : a whatever that is and Water's Rise.
3 : Earth stone
2 : Mmhmm
2 : So I move it up a tick mark
2 : Um shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top.
2 : I'm not that great at shuffling.
3 : It's ok
2 : And I discard this pi- this card, put this on top
3 : And you gotta pick three cards now
2 : Mmhmm
2 : One, two
2 : three. Ok, so now we have to
2 : flood Lost Lagoon,
2 : uh Whispering Garden, and Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Lost Lagoon's there.
3 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Oh there it is
3 : Ok
2 : Uh
2 : alright.
2 : K, next person.
3 : Ok, it's my turn, so I'm gonna use one action to give this to you
1 : Mmhmm
1 : I can't take it, I have five.
2 : Yeah but I think once you
2 : take it can you just immediately discard one? I think
1 : Can I- I can get rid of one?
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah, I think you can do that.
1 : I'm gonna get rid of the flame card
2 : Ok
1 : because there's only two (--)
3 : I (guess) if you ever have six or more you must immediately choose and discard so like I think I can give it to you
2 : Yeah, I think, I think you can
1 : Six or more?
1 : Ok, I'll take it.
2 : Yeah
3 : So- No I mean like that doesn't count as one of your cards, so just discard the
1 : Yeah
3 : earth stone I guess.
3 : -s. Or, actually
2 : Or the fire, whichever.
1 : The f-
3 : No, probably the fire cause we actually have more of the earth stones now
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
1 : I guess that goes in the pile then?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yup
3 : Ok, so that was one move. Should I shore up this?
2 : Um
1 : What else are you gonna do?
2 : Sure
3 : Like, probably nothing.
2 : Yeah
3 : Or unless I could give,
3 : I could give this card to you, can I give more than one?
2 : Um
3 : I could give this to you, or does it, I guess it doesn't really matter, we all have one.
2 : Yeah, I think you can.
2 : Yeah
3 : Or should I give it to him so like
2 : No you, yeah you can't give it to him. Um
1 : Why not?
3 : Oh wait, yeah, never mind
3 : You have too many
2 : I mean, it's- I, I have more cards than you do so I think
1 : Oh, you're right.
3 : Well I could give it to you, we're also standing
1 : Yeah this would be a convenient time.
2 : That's-
3 : on the same
2 : Yeah go ahead, yeah.
2 : Let's do that.
3 : Alright
3 : cool.
2 : So how many actions is that, two?
3 : That was three cause I gave two cards and shored that up, so
2 : (See)
2 : Three
2 : ok
3 : And then I need three flood cards.
2 : Oh yeah
3 : Iron Gate,
3 : Temple of the Moon, and Cliffs of Abandon. Iron Gate is gone.
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : And cliffs
1 : And
3 : Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Cliffs- Uh, oh there they are.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : so
3 : Ok, what you should do first
1 : Shore up
3 : Shore that up
3 : move, and then cash in the treasure.
2 : and then move
1 : Yup
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : (--)
3 : So
2 : Wait
3 : But you don't have to move. No, no, no don't do that, don't do that.
2 : (--) you don't have to move.
1 : Oh, no I don't move, no. You're right. Ok so shore it up.
2 : Yeah
3 : You can flip that,
3 : move to there,
3 : and then cash in the treasure.
2 : As this third action?
1 : Is
2 : Yup
1 : Where does that go?
2 : Yeah just
3 : Take it
1 : Sweet
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok, so now I can do one more thing, correct? Or is that-
2 : So that was three
2 : No, that was, that was three.
3 : No, that was three.
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, you're right.
3 : And then you need three flood cards.
1 : Copper Gate,
1 : Mm
1 : Crimson Forest,
1 : and
1 : Temple of the Sun.
3 : We just gotta find Copper Gate
2 : Oh, there it is, it's right below the
3 : Oh, ok
3 : Alright
2 : Ok
1 : Right there
2 : Um
2 : Yeah just put it there. Ok, next
2 : It's my turn, um
1 : What are we trying to do? What's next? So we have an idea.
2 : Next
2 : so we have four
3 : We have four of these so
1 : We have four of the
2 : ok
2 : So what I could do, is I could transfer two of them to you on this turn, using up two.
3 : And then cause he can go down here and get
2 : Yeah and then you can use- then you can transfer one on that turn.
3 : them.
3 : I would just need to move to meet him and then give it to him.
1 : Or you could fly to me, right?
2 : Yeah
3 : I mean like, yeah
3 : Theoretically I could fly to you.
2 : Yeah that's that one
3 : But you're right next to me so I wouldn't do that.
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok, so first I'm gonna take two actions and give the Engineer
2 : the two wind cards.
1 : I'm not on the same thing with you.
1 : I'm not
2 : No, I don't have to- you don't have to be. I can give it to you anywhere I am.
3 : She can, she can give any- Yeah
1 : Oh, really?
1 : Awesome, ok
2 : Ok
2 : so that's
3 : Or wait, can you give multiple- It says give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action, so I think it's only one action.
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, one eh, one action, one action per card, so therefore I gave two cards so that's two actions used. I can use one more
1 : One action, sweet.
3 : Oh
3 : two, ok.
2 : Um
2 : but
2 : let's see
3 : I mean
2 : But I can- No cause moving would take an action and flipping would be another action, so it doesn't look like
2 : Mm
2 : See unless I just moved
1 : Keep thinking about what you're doing
1 : um
1 : Pilot, you should move
1 : uh, you should fly there and I can give you all three of these,
1 : and you can immediately take it.
3 : I mean you can't give them to me, I can only give- you can only give cards on your turn. So I can just meet you here, give you these cards, and then on your turn you could go there.
1 : Why can't I give them to you?
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh
2 : You could- What you could do during your turn though is fly him to that space
1 : Ok
3 : I very well could do that.
2 : as well.
2 : Yeah
2 : So since you're on the same space give the card
3 : And this doesn't count as an action
2 : then fly him to- Yeah exactly.
3 : Ok
1 : And you can go there too.
3 : Perfect
2 : Ok
3 : So are you gonna do
2 : I have one more, I have one more turn but I don't think ah there's an action that would advance us so I guess-
2 : Actually what I will do is I'll move up here so I'm in a position to um save more tiles.
3 : Ok
2 : So that's action three and then Treasure cards.
1 : Wouldn't
1 : moving the other way would've saved more tiles? Doesn't matter now.
3 : I mean, these are all
2 : Yeah
2 : Oh
2 : yeah good point.
2 : I don't think, I don't think I can take back moves now though.
3 : Can you
1 : Yeah, don't worry about it.
2 : Ok, so there's this one
2 : Ok I don't know what we do with Treasure cards where- I'm guessing just discard (at my leisure)
2 : Alright, so I have a Water's Rise
2 : So I'll move that up a tick mark
2 : then
3 : shuffle,
2 : place on top, I get these a lot.
3 : I gonna (just take) that for ya
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : Placing that on top, and then, take three.
3 : And pick three
2 : So we have Whispering Gardens,
2 : which is now gone, Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Here you need Whispering Gardens
2 : Oh yup
2 : and then the third one is Temple of the Sun.
3 : That's gone too
2 : Yeah, ok, so that's gonna be
3 : Can I have that and then Cliffs of Abandon is
2 : Oh Temples of the Sun's gone, ok. Cliffs of Abandon, I'm standing on that one.
3 : Yeah
1 : Did you shore up anything yet?
2 : I didn't- I didn't have time on my turn.
1 : Ok
1 : because we only have these
2 : Yeah, my first ac- my first action will be to save them
1 : Well we have- This is the last one
3 : Ok, I'm gonna use, I'm gonna sandbag this because we need this guy. Ok, it doesn't count as an action, so like, cool.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah, makes sense
2 : Go ahead
3 : Um, this also doesn't count as an action. I'm gonna fly you here,
1 : Ok
3 : then
2 : K, first action
3 : I'm gonna fly here and give you that card.
1 : That's your t-
2 : That's one
3 : That's one,
2 : One,
3 : two
2 : two, mmhmm
2 : Let's see one, two, three, four, you need to get rid of one of your cards now.
1 : One, two, three, four, ok, I just have to
3 : Um
3 : get rid of the fire probably.
1 : Like
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : And then
3 : should I do anything else or just like hang out down there? Should I move
2 : Uh I don't think it would advance our position
3 : I mean, I can just move back so I'm closer to the middle kind of area
1 : Or it wouldn't, it wouldn't hurt
1 : yeah, it wouldn't hurt
2 : That's a good point
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Oh, two
3 : Oh dear
3 : And then three
2 : Oh, yeah
3 : Copper Gate is gone
1 : Ok
3 : Crimson Forest is also gone
3 : Oh no
3 : And Breaker's Bridge
2 : Ok, it's flooded again.
1 : Ok, so my first thing will be to
1 : get the little guy.
1 : So that's one action
2 : Mmhmm
2 : See
1 : My next action
2 : Wait a second, I have an idea.
2 : So, you have one of the stone cards. I have
2 : two of the stone cards, so on my action I could give all three to the Pilot and the Pilot could go to one of the Temples
1 : She has one
3 : That's true, I mean the only Temple that's left
1 : Can you fl-
1 : How bout this
1 : Do you wanna fly me there? You have two cards
3 : I mean I can't do that now I'd have to wait till my turn.
2 : I mean
1 : On no you can't
2 : I think it would save some time if you give me the cards then I give her all the cards so that she can play it on her turn instead of us having to wait again for it to be your turn.
1 : Wait
1 : but you're standing here
2 : I am
1 : How would I get there?
2 : I'm the Messenger, I can give you a card anywhere
1 : Ok
2 : I can- or like, wait a second, oh you're right, you have to get to me.
3 : Just like, I think as one of your moves you should just move towards the c-center more.
2 : Let's see, if you go one,
2 : two, and then three, you'll be on, that'd be on the space.
3 : That
3 : He already played, he (can't) with the getting a treasure was one card so he could just get two and then get closer to the center.
2 : That's true,
2 : oh that's true.
1 : How bout I do-
2 : No, that won't
1 : Can I move tw- I can move twice and shore up both of these.
3 : You can't because
3 : or sh-
3 : does shoring up count as an action? That's one action
2 : It does
1 : That's
1 : Yeah
3 : So you can't shore up anything cause you already used one action, you have two actions left.
2 : Mm, good point.
1 : Ooo
2 : Hmm
2 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : Hmm
3 : I just think you should move to be more centrally located, cause there's really nothing else that like he could do right now. Unless- or unless, he could
2 : No, good point
1 : Yup
2 : Oh, wait a second
3 : He- unless he moves to here and then gives me his Treasure card
2 : Yeah, that's a good idea, let's do that. Let's go with that move.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Can I have two cards please?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : K, we'll need those eventually.
3 : Or maybe not.
1 : Tidal Palace,
1 : Temple of the Moon,
1 : and Lost Lagoon.
3 : Lost Lagoon's gone.
1 : Ok
1 : We didn't need it anyways.
2 : Ok
3 : Wait, no, nope.
1 : Oh
2 : Ok, then it's my turn.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok you should shore up Temple of the Moon for sure
2 : (See if)
2 : yeah, that's gonna be my first move,
2 : then my second
2 : and third move will be giving you the two Treasure cards.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, and then Treasure card draw
2 : so that's
2 : one of these and the lion thing.
2 : And then let's see
2 : then I need to draw three flood cards.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So now we have Cave of Shadows,
2 : one of the fire ones, I think it's this one.
1 : I think you (abandon --)
2 : Uh Dunes of Deception and the Silver Gate.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok, so then
3 : it's my turn.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : I'm gonna fly here
3 : or should I shore something up first? Does it matter?
1 : Mm
2 : Um you c-
3 : Should I shore up this, fly here, and then
3 : get the treasure?
2 : Yeah, I guess you can, yeah,
2 : sure.
3 : K
3 : Shore up,
3 : fly here,
1 : And that's three moves right?
3 : And that's three moves, get the treasure. Wait, do we all have to
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
1 : We have three now, we can leave.
3 : We can leave, we should go leave.
2 : Yeah le- So let's for this next turn move closer to the space because it needs to be the Pilot's turn in order to use the Helicopter Lift.
1 : Yeah
3 : I mean, it's just anybody, I mean I guess I have the card so
2 : Oh wait
2 : or can you use it anytime?
1 : And you can also fly someone there too if you need to, right?
2 : Yeah y-
3 : That's true, I could fly someone there and then
2 : If we're on the same space.
2 : Oh, yeah, I'm close to the Pilot but
2 : see it would take you two moves to get there.
3 : It would take both of you two moves to get there. I can fly there for myself as my special turn.
1 : Ok, well let's, let's do it as fast as possible then.
2 : Yeah, ok
3 : And then we'll-
2 : Let's do it.
3 : Ok, I need
2 : Yeah
3 : flood cards. Three of them.
3 : Alright, Howling Garden,
3 : Cave of Embers,
2 : Top, yeah.
3 : and Bronze Gate.
2 : Uh, over here.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Ok, so it's now is my turn?
2 : Flood
2 : (ok) yeah
3 : Your turn, where are you at?
1 : I'm right here so I'm gonna move one,
3 : You can just-
1 : shore up these two, and move over.
3 : Alright
3 : Good.
2 : One yup,
2 : that works.
2 : Cause I don't think it's extra points if you get all four.
1 : Ok so now I'm gonna stay there.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Can I have two cards please?
2 : Yes, ooo, sorry.
1 : Doesn't matter.
1 : Ok, so Water's Rising
1 : and
1 : Helicopter.
1 : So
1 : Let's do that
2 : Ok now take three.
3 : Ok
1 : (ow)
1 : Cave of Shadows,
2 : Cave
1 : Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Cave of Shadows, Cliffs of Abandon,
2 : uh Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Nice
2 : Ok, then it's my turn.
3 : K
2 : So I guess
3 : you can just move two, cause then I can just fly, so like it doesn't really matter you don't need to shore up anything unless you really s- want to.
2 : Do I?
2 : Ok so you're gonna fly so it doesn't, it's not gonna matter. So here I go one, two, and as a third I guess I could but you're gonna fly anyway so it's
1 : Yeah there's no need.
3 : So just
3 : Yeah I didn't-
3 : For fun, for funsies.
2 : Sure, might as well.
2 : Ok and then two
2 : Yeah I got
2 : these but it doesn't really matter cause I can- I have now
3 : Yeah, it's a discard one anyway, just
2 : (I didn't see, yeah)
3 : Yeah
3 : doesn't matter.
2 : Three, four, five, yup. And then three of these.
2 : So here we have Temple of the Moon so that's now flooded. Dunes of Deception, that's gone,
2 : and then Silver Gate, which is now gone.
1 : Gone.
3 : Alright, I'm gonna use my power, fly here for one action, and then I'm gonna use this to fly us all off the island.
2 : Ok
2 : yeah.

2 : Alright
2 : ready?
1 : Ok, so
3 : What actions are you gonna take?
1 : Um, what can I do? Shore up two tiles or
3 : Instead of one, for one action.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yea-
1 : Yeah, sure, I'll do this one since that has the thing on it.
2 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright
1 : Does it have to be adjacent?
2 : Uh yeah
1 : I'm guessing
1 : Ok
2 : Or it could- Or you could be on it.
2 : So, you can get the Lost Lagoon now
1 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : So you can do the Lost- Yeah
1 : (--)
1 : And then um
3 : Then you can move
2 : move to the Whispering Garden
2 : and then you could shore up both the Cliffs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : Oh yeah
3 : Nice
3 : Yeah
3 : Yeah then
2 : Alright
3 : Two Treasure cards
2 : (--)
1 : Oh
1 : Ok, so
2 : Ouch, well that was fast, ok
3 : Oh no
3 : Ok so now
1 : Move this
3 : Yup
3 : move it one,
3 : and then we have to
1 : Shuffle that or s-something
3 : Draw two
3 : Ok yeah
1 : and then put this in the treasure
1 : discard
2 : Alright
2 : so uh
2 : draw two of these
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh ok
3 : Uh so at the end of every turn you draw two.
1 : Mm
1 : Cliffs of Abanon and Phantom Rock
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Uh oh
2 : and
1 : Oh
2 : Oh
2 : Well that was fast
3 : I need the Phantom Rock card.
3 : Yup
3 : these ones both go out.
2 : Alright
2 : so, my turn.
2 : Um
2 : I can give cards but I'm not sure if that's really that useful, um.
3 : If you need to do that yet?
3 : So you can also move
2 : I think
2 : um
3 : So if you move one you can
2 : take
3 : shore up
2 : Shore
3 : Yeah
2 : Um, do you want me to move over here first or
3 : Oh yeah you might as well,
2 : Alright so
3 : just in case.
2 : But then
2 : like
2 : shore that up and
3 : Um
1 : Mm is there any way (--)
2 : Um, giving a treasure
3 : That's
2 : Giving a card, like I don't think this
2 : uh is useful to give yet.
3 : No you
1 : I don't
3 : Yeah
1 : It's not
3 : I mean you can just take one turn
2 : Um
3 : or two turns
3 : So you took two turns already
2 : Yeah
3 : So we
3 : can just-
3 : Well two actions
2 : Um
2 : I can take a
3 : You can move again if you want
2 : Um
3 : one more time, or then you can just
2 : Maybe I'll just take
2 : the
2 : treasures, the end.
2 : Do that, because we can take
2 : up to three actions, so.
1 : Yeah, that's fine.
2 : Alright
2 : Defer this turn, um ok, so
2 : new treasures.
2 : sandbag and another earth thing.
2 : So
2 : Better
3 : Ok
2 : And two of these
2 : Whispering Garden and Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
3 : And then those, yup
3 : Ok
3 : So now it's my turn.
3 : So I can fly anywhere
3 : should I do that?
1 : Uh
2 : Mm
2 : um
3 : Cause we
3 : We can't really give any cards yet
1 : Yeah we-
1 : we don't really have any.
3 : or anything.
3 : So I can just move-
2 : Um, did you want to shore up any locations first or?
3 : Yeah wait
3 : I mean I can move over here so I can shore up these two.
1 : Probably like yeah, Whispering Garden, cause that's right there.
2 : Yeah, that's probably a good move, alright.
3 : Yeah
3 : so
3 : I-
3 : Should I move here or there?
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
3 : Does it- it doesn't really matter.
2 : It do- Yeah, so alright.
1 : Yeah, it doesn't
3 : I'll just do this one
3 : So then, yeah shore up
2 : both of them.
3 : And then that's my whole turn.
2 : Yeah
2 : Nice job.
3 : Yup
2 : Alright
2 : Two treasure cards.
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : and two of these cards.
3 : ok, Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon
2 : Oh
3 : There's Lost Lagoon- Oh no
2 : Oh (--)
3 : Ok so that one goes back over there.
2 : Alright
1 : Um
2 : you're up again?
1 : Lost Lagoon.
3 : Ok I have two Helicopter Lift cards now, so
3 : anyone thinks of a time that we can use these?
1 : Yay
2 : Um
1 : I feel like I should start going over here since I have two and then you have one
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah that might be smart.
1 : And then
2 : Uh actually if you use the Helicopter-
1 : Oh yeah
2 : I'm not sure like if we have enough Helicopter Lifts if we wanna use it too early, but
2 : if you moved us both here then I could go over here then
3 : Ok
3 : I'll just do that
3 : So to this one?
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah, I guess
1 : Wait
2 : If you're, if you're, if you wanna do that or
1 : Oh
1 : Yeah, that's fine
3 : Ok, and then you could,
3 : you can take all your actions still
2 : Yeah
3 : Cause it- This isn't
3 : an action card.
2 : Yeah it's special.
1 : Ok
1 : um
1 : Uh
1 : I don't know what to do.
1 : Shore up, uh give a treasure card.
3 : Yeah I guess there's
1 : Do you- Does anybody
1 : mm
1 : If I
1 : give
1 : who would know
1 : Um
1 : I guess it would be better for me to give you this
3 : You can just give that to him.
1 : and you have two.
2 : Uh ok
1 : So we're closer.
3 : But now you have five cards, so
2 : Yeah
3 : be careful.
2 : And I can't give this sandbag card
1 : Yeah
2 : but do you want
2 : like,
2 : do you want me to use this now on the Lost Lagoon?
2 : Or
2 : or we'll see what happens with
3 : Yeah
2 : this?
1 : Yeah sure ok and is that it?
2 : Ok
3 : Ok so now
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah, that's it.
2 : Alright
3 : So
1 : Thanks
1 : Ok so I have
3 : Nice
1 : Three of that.
2 : Alright, we
2 : alright.
1 : And then
2 : That's good.
3 : Ok
1 : This and then
1 : I do this right?
2 : Yeah, two of those
3 : Yeah two
1 : So, Iron Gate
1 : and Temple of the Moon.
3 : This is Iron Gate
2 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
2 : So, my turn.
2 : Um, so
3 : Are you gonna move
3 : to
3 : the Sun?
2 : Yeah
2 : and
2 : I wish, I really wish I could give this away,
2 : but
2 : um
3 : But
3 : So can you discard that
3 : So you have
1 : I
1 : I think it's when you like pull or something
3 : Or you
3 : so you have to draw two cards, yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : So you're
3 : I think you can
3 : Hmm
3 : Ok
3 : Ok yeah, you must immediately choose and discard extra cards, so
2 : Um
2 : Yeah, um
1 : Mmhmm.
2 : I guess we'll
2 : uh if I
2 : like I don't think I'll be able to use it if I have to choose the discard so
2 : Um guess it's a matter of
2 : (--)
2 : I
2 : might
2 : uh
2 : uh
2 : should I place it on the Lost Lagoon or?
1 : Or you should put it like on this one, cause that one actually has like one of the
2 : On the Iron Gate
1 : the Treasure things.
2 : Um
3 : Mmhmm
3 : You're
2 : does
2 : Oh, the Temple of the Moon.
3 : Yeah
3 : ok so
2 : uh
1 : Either, either one of those.
3 : Even though that's not an action, like do you wanna do it right now?
2 : Um
3 : You might as well.
1 : Uh yeah
2 : I guess, yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So yeah, that goes there.
2 : And
2 : Do you want
2 : do you think
2 : I should give this to- Do you want this or?
3 : Yeah
3 : yeah, ok.
2 : Ok
2 : great.
3 : Yeah and then you pick up your two.
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Well
3 : Oh no
2 : Crap
2 : Ok
2 : and I have to draw three now.
2 : Huh
2 : Oops
2 : uh
2 : Cliffs of Abandon, Breaker's Bridge, and Temple of the Moon.
2 : Temple of the Moon.
2 : And in Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Ok, so now
3 : it's my turn.
2 : Yeah
3 : So the first thing I will do is give you this card.
2 : Um
2 : um
2 : you have to be on the same space as her to do that.
3 : Oh yeah, oh no.
1 : Oh yeah
3 : Ok well I can move, so I can use that as my action.
2 : Yeah,
2 : yeah
1 : Ok
3 : So there
3 : wait-
3 : Should I
3 : put these
3 : shore up first?
3 : As my
2 : Um, I, I don't think they're likely to be flooded on the next turn so
3 : one of them.
2 : I think you can
3 : so don't worry about it?
2 : Yeah I
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : so just
3 : move here
1 : Mmhmm
3 : as my flying
2 : That's t- that's-
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : And then I can give you this
1 : Ok
1 : yeah
3 : So that's two actions, should I take one more action?
2 : Um
3 : There's nothing else- I mean I could move.
3 : I can move here,
2 : To the
3 : just in case I get one of these.
2 : Yeah, that might be a good call.
3 : Ok
3 : so now it's your turn.
3 : Engineer
1 : Ok, so
2 : Oh
2 : two cards.
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Oh yeah
1 : Ok
3 : I keep forgetting about these things.
3 : Ok
2 : Nice
3 : So now I have five cards.
2 : Alright, and three of these cards.
3 : Oh no!
3 : I'm scared
2 : Yeah
3 : Iron Gate
2 : Goodbye
3 : Oh no
3 : Whispering Garden is one
1 : That one
2 : Ok
3 : And then Lost Lagoon
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah that's gone.
3 : Oh no
3 : Ok so that one goes, sorry
3 : back over there.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so it's four right, so I can
2 : Yeah
3 : So you can-
3 : you take the treasure.
2 : Uh, take the treasure
1 : Ok
2 : Alright, we have that one, yeah
1 : Is this one, where do I put it?
2 : Uh, I guess in
1 : In there?
1 : I don't know
3 : Um
2 : uh
3 : Well
3 : I guess you can just put it near your stuff
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : And this goes
1 : over
1 : in the discard?
2 : Um
3 : Or does it
3 : talk about capturing
3 : Ok, capture a treasure-
3 : You may capture a treasure by discarding, yeah
3 : So they go here
1 : So this card
2 : To the treasure discard pile
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
2 : Alright, nice
2 : Uh
3 : And then when you capture a treasure
3 : Yup
3 : ok
1 : Ok um
3 : Ok, now, so that's one action. So you have two more
1 : And then I can
2 : Uh do you want to
1 : Do you want me to just
2 : Uh
2 : shore up, uh, these areas.
3 : Yeah, if you move,
3 : if you move here,
3 : you use one action to move here, then you can shore up
1 : And
1 : those two, ok
2 : Both of em, yeah.
3 : Yeah
1 : So that's
1 : two and then
2 : shore up makes three, alright.
3 : Yeah, ok.
1 : There
2 : three cards.
1 : So those two and then
2 : Ok
3 : Mm
3 : three
1 : two,
1 : three.
1 : So Howling
1 : Garden, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate.
2 : Garden
3 : There's a Crimson
2 : Crimson Forest is
3 : Oh it's right here
3 : Got it.
2 : Ok
3 : And then those go over there.
2 : Alright, so, my turn, um
2 : Hmm, um
3 : So you can give
3 : your treasure cards
3 : away
2 : Um
3 : But we both have one of these.
1 : Yeah
3 : So, I mean you can give us each one.
2 : Um
3 : And that's two actions.
2 : Um
2 : Ok, um
3 : Or something
3 : Or you can give both of them to-
3 : Oh wait.
3 : Yeah you can give one
3 : to someone on one action and the same
3 : to the other to the same person (--)
2 : I just realized that
2 : uh probably should
2 : Probably
2 : No, no, never mind- That's probably, that's the best turn that would, would've been possible. Um so
2 : Uh
2 : hmm
3 : Well
3 : You can give her two cards but I can't take any cards
3 : So you,
1 : Yeah
3 : you might as well just give her both of those cards.
1 : But like I don't, we're not on the same- Oh!
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Is yours the one that can go to
2 : Well I can, I can give you, I can give you at anytime but I can't receive unless we're on the same tile
1 : Oh
1 : you can uh
3 : Oh, ok, so you can just give
3 : her those cards since you're the Messenger.
2 : Uh, you want both of them?
3 : So that's two
3 : Yeah that would be two actions.
2 : Um
1 : Or you could give, like, ok, ok, that's fine.
3 : (Good)
2 : Uh, because I
3 : Cause I have five cards so I can't take any
2 : Ok
2 : because uh,
2 : uh, uh, the thing I was thinking of was to use two actions to move here
3 : Mmhmm
2 : then shore this up,
2 : then on the next turn, like
3 : Ok yeah
2 : by then, hopefully we'll have all the things and then come back here
2 : and
2 : two actions and then claim that treasure.
3 : That's a good idea- Well
3 : mm
3 : you'll have to discard
3 : one of those cards.
3 : Why don't you give her one card
2 : Um, ok, do you want
3 : Like what should we shoot for?
2 : K we have
2 : One,
3 : first
1 : You should probably give me that one, since I'm on that one, or something, I don't know.
2 : Alright
2 : Here ya go
3 : Ok
2 : and
1 : Yeah
2 : now
2 : do I wait?
3 : No, no
3 : that was one action, right?
2 : Yeah
3 : So now you can move
3 : if you wanted to move over here.
2 : But
2 : this would take two actions and
3 : Yeah
2 : that's already my turn
2 : and that
2 : discounts the purpose of being there.
3 : Or I can Lift you
2 : Oh boy
3 : So I could move you
3 : or, or you, I can move anyone,
3 : or myself.
3 : But I wanna give you this purple card so I wanna stay
2 : Yeah
3 : with you.
2 : So
3 : So I can move both of us
2 : Ok, that's probably a good idea.
3 : Should I move both of us maybe here?
2 : Yeah that
3 : And then you can
2 : um
3 : or maybe over here, I don't know, that's really far.
2 : Um
2 : since like
2 : um
2 : Water's there, um
2 : Here's pro-
3 : Cause we don't have- This card means nothing to us now cause we don't need that
2 : Yeah
2 : so
2 : I think
3 : Or, or this one
2 : Um, I think that here's
3 : So moving both of us here
3 : using the Helicopter Lift.
2 : Ye-
2 : Yeah, here's probably-
3 : And I can- I also have a sandbag
2 : (--)
2 : Oh
3 : If I were to use one of these, like
3 : I guess you could give me
3 : a card
2 : I think
3 : as an action
2 : Um
2 : I'm not sure, uh
3 : So I, I would either move both of us or sandbag a random thing
3 : or you can take your actions to do something.
2 : Um
2 : like I don't really have- No, I don't really think it-
2 : there's much I could do with my actions, so
3 : Yeah, so should I just,
1 : Alright, then
3 : should I lift us here
3 : and then you can flip this?
3 : Shore it up?
2 : Ok
3 : Cause then- you're so close, you know?
3 : Right?
2 : Yeah, I guess
2 : Ok
2 : Let's do that.
3 : And then you can, you pick up two cards.
3 : Ok, so
2 : And, shore this up.
2 : And then two cards
2 : Ah
2 : Ok
2 : You know, I think this part of the game is annoying because
2 : it's the same cards getting recycled and that ov- over and over again. So three
3 : Yeah, it's sad
3 : Oh
1 : Mm
3 : Ooo
2 : Cliffs of Abandon, Howling Garden, and Breaker's Bridge.
3 : Ok so
3 : oh we would've lost that
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
3 : so now it's my turn.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yup
3 : So
3 : I'm gonna give you this.
2 : Cool, thank you.
3 : Should I shore this
3 : up?
3 : And then should I fly somewhere else?
3 : Or should I fly somewhere else and then shore
2 : That's
2 : Uh
3 : Cause you- We just, we could lose this.
3 : So should I shore this up as one action?
2 : Yeah that might be a good idea.
1 : Yeah you should
3 : Ok
3 : And then I can fly, or fly anyone else
3 : Or no I can fly myself
2 : Uh
3 : cause I'm the Pilot, but I don't have the
3 : Lift anymore.
3 : So I can fly
3 : myself
3 : in this vicinity,
3 : just in case
1 : Yeah, sure
3 : So should I fly to this, maybe?
1 : Mm
2 : Mm
2 : There's not really a point of going to the Temple of the Moon since
3 : Here?
2 : Um
2 : Actua- I think
2 : like the points that
2 : you're around right now
2 : is pretty advantageous.
3 : Ok, so
3 : well what
3 : are we going for, we're going for
2 : We're getting
2 : like the next time-
3 : We're gonna get this
2 : Yeah
1 : Or you can pat- or you can
1 : give me
1 : that- this
2 : Yeah
1 : since I'm on there
3 : Oh yeah, ok
2 : Yeah, that's a good idea.
3 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
1 : Oh wait, no, we can't do that, we can't do that
2 : Whoa wait
3 : Oh, no, no, no, no
2 : So you can- But you can move yourself there and do that
3 : Yeah, yeah
3 : Oh yeah, I can move myself
1 : And then
1 : we can do it later
3 : Yes
1 : Ok
1 : so it's my turn?
1 : No, you have to do that
2 : Wait, how many actions did you take?
1 : She did
1 : three
2 : Uh
1 : Right?
3 : I gave you one and I
2 : Oh right, giving me, shoring that up and then there, ok, right, sorry.
3 : flipped one up and then I moved. Ok, three.
1 : And then she moved
3 : So
1 : Ok, then you can do
1 : That
2 : Alright, so your treasures
3 : Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : I keep forgetting about the treasures
2 : Yeah and
2 : (--)
2 : Ok, Helicopter Lift, that's good.
3 : Alright
2 : Those things, that's also good, she can
3 : Mmhmm
3 : So I can do any, like-
2 : But, wait
3 : if a-
2 : Then you'd have to discard one of the things
2 : if she gave you that and I gave you
2 : this. But if we try to go for that
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok, so, I need to do those
3 : still
2 : Alright, yeah, three.
3 : So three
3 : and then it'll just be her turn.
3 : Ok, Temple of the Moon,
2 : Goodbye
3 : uh Whispering Garden,
2 : Oh
3 : Uh oh
2 : Crap
3 : And then Crimson Forest
2 : Ok that's fine.
3 : Ok so
2 : Alright
2 : you're up.
1 : Um
1 : um
1 : I think I should
3 : So you can,
3 : you can shore up
2 : Oh wait, oh
1 : I think I should
2 : Wait, um
1 : move here, one, two
2 : But wait, but wait, um
2 : I thought the whole purpose was to give me that
3 : Oh yeah,
3 : yeah, give
2 : But you'd have to like use up your
3 : Oh no, wait
2 : two actions and then that would take up the third action.
2 : Um
1 : What?
3 : Wait so can she give you that card if you have
2 : No, she- I, I have
2 : like
3 : You have to have room for it
2 : I can give at anytime
2 : but she has to be on the same tile as me.
3 : Oh, yeah, ok
3 : So
3 : I mean I could Lift.
1 : Wait, that I give who what?
2 : This one to me so that on my next turn I can go to here and claim the treasure.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : So I could Lift her to you
1 : Yeah, I think I need to go over here so that I can bring this back, because this is
2 : Or,
3 : Cause we're gonna need to go in here
3 : or here
2 : Like
3 : to get the
3 : last
1 : Wait, yo, oh ok, ok, one, two, three.
3 : the third one, yeah.
3 : Cause, yeah
2 : Like, you don't have to go over there cause there's-
2 : Ok
3 : Oh yeah
3 : ok
3 : Oh yeah, I forgot
3 : so
3 : should we just not?
2 : Yeah
3 : just leave that?
2 : Just leave that
3 : I mean, cause we just need to, we need to keep these ones, yeah.
1 : Ok, I'll just do these,
1 : I'll just put these up.
2 : Ok
1 : So that we don't get like
3 : Yeah
3 : So that's one action
2 : K
3 : and then
2 : And then
3 : I mean I can,
3 : should I fly her to you so you
1 : And
3 : Or wait?
1 : Wait, one, two. So can I- I can't even give this to you though, because you have five?
2 : That's
2 : You can
3 : Or do you discard it?
2 : I think
2 : I think I can
2 : discard
2 : but
2 : um
3 : Yeah, in order to accept a card, if you already have five cards you must discard one.
3 : So
2 : Yeah
3 : should I Helicopter Lift her
3 : to you?
2 : Um
3 : And then she can give you the card
3 : as a second action.
2 : Yeah
2 : I-
2 : Are you ok with that or
1 : Yeah, that's fine.
3 : Yeah that, I mean I don't know what else we can do.
2 : Alright
3 : Ok, so Engineer
2 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : Alright, I'll get rid of this and
3 : yeah you give
3 : him the earth
2 : Alright
3 : Yup, there you go
3 : So you have one more action
3 : but
1 : I think that
3 : I mean you could move to this,
3 : just in case.
2 : Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
3 : Yeah
3 : cause I have
3 : two of these, or you can move back towards this way.
1 : Um, I'll move back over here since I have- Which one (--) this one?
2 : Yeah that's probably
3 : Ok, yeah
2 : Alright
3 : so
2 : The (--) so, you can do that. Yeah that's good. Alright
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Two cards?
1 : Oh that, that's good.
2 : Nice!
3 : Oh my gosh, nice!
1 : Ok
2 : Oh, that's good
1 : And then one, two, three
2 : Alright
2 : three
2 : Ok, let's see what we have to deal with
1 : Silver Gate, Cave of Embers,
3 : Silver Gate
1 : and then Copper Gate.
3 : Copper Gate is gone, I need the Copper Gate card.
2 : Ok, that's fine.
2 : Alright then
3 : Ok, so those are discard
2 : Alright
2 : so
2 : my turn now?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : One, two
2 : and then skip all these
2 : to claim this.
2 : Alright
3 : So you
2 : That's all my actions
3 : That's all you're gonna do?
3 : Oh wait that's
2 : Tha- that's three actions, move-
3 : Oh ok
3 : Oh, yeah you moved twice, sorry.
3 : Ok
2 : Alright, so, these two
3 : So
2 : and one,
2 : two,
2 : three.
2 : Dunes of Deception,
2 : Coral Palace,
3 : Oh oh
2 : and Bronze Gate.
2 : Uh, Bronze Gate was which one again?
3 : Oh it's over-
2 : Ok.
3 : Ok
3 : so now it's my turn.
2 : Yup
3 : So
3 : should I
3 : flip this?
3 : Or I have the sandbag
1 : Yeah
3 : so
2 : Uh fli-
3 : I can either use an action
2 : Using the action is probably good
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah
3 : so
3 : one action.
3 : And then
3 : I can
3 : give
3 : No I can't give these- I can fly to you
3 : and then give you these.
2 : Uh, like it uh- it's- we only need
3 : Or I can fly myself here and then you can give me these later?
2 : We only need, we only need one more treasure to win
3 : Oh yeah
2 : and she has her four things ready to go
1 : Oh
1 : True
3 : Yeah, you're right
3 : Ok, so
1 : So just go to the Landing or something? I don't know
2 : Um, so
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : so I'll
3 : move to the landing.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Or I can fly to one of you and then
2 : No, no
3 : No, cause- Well what if we get the Helicopter Lift?
2 : Because we have to
3 : Cause we need one. Well, we're not gonna get two. So I'll- Should I just go here?
2 : Yeah, we need the Helicopter Lifts, so
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So am I done?
3 : And then
1 : Mm
3 : There's nothing else
2 : Actually
2 : uh
3 : Should I
2 : Too- It's too late once you made move
3 : Is it?
2 : because I was, I think
3 : You can't go back?
2 : Uh, because-
3 : I mean I can move again.
2 : No, no
2 : it's
3 : Cause I- That's only my second action.
2 : It's fine.
2 : No, the,
2 : the thing I was thinking was that you moved here and then shored that up, but
3 : Oh
1 : But
1 : No, it's fine.
2 : it's fine.
3 : Ok
3 : so
1 : go ahead and pick
2 : Alright, two treasures
3 : Alright
2 : Alright, and
3 : Oh wait, I need to discard one.
3 : Does it
2 : Yeah, that's fine, the red
3 : Matter?
2 : Ok, whatever, whatever, it's fine.
3 : The red one is the one I picked up,
3 : so.
2 : Three cards,
2 : hopefully.
3 : Ok
3 : Misty Marsh,
2 : Ok
3 : um Temple of the Sun,
3 : and Tidal Palace.
2 : Ok
1 : K, so it's my turn, so
2 : Alright, so- Yup
1 : I'll move this way, yeah I'll go there.
2 : (--)
2 : Yeah, Coral Palace
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And then
2 : Then those things
2 : and then woo, (--)
1 : Yup
2 : And
2 : One more turn.
1 : And then I'll just move to Fool's Landing.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, good idea.
2 : Alright
3 : So I have a sandbag too if- Should we do something?
1 : Uh
1 : I'll have the Helicopter Lift, that's good.
3 : Ok, perfect.
2 : Oh
2 : Water's Rise.
1 : Water's Rise
3 : Oh no
2 : Crap
1 : But we're still on three, so we're alright.
3 : I think we'll be ok
2 : Ok, so
1 : We'll be alright
3 : Yeah, we're pretty close.
1 : Oh this goes over there right?
3 : Yup
2 : Ok
3 : So now,
3 : you pick up
2 : Three
3 : three of those.
2 : yeah.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : (--)
3 : What do we got?
1 : Ok, we're good, um
1 : We have Coral Palace,
2 : Ok
1 : Dunes of Deception, so this is gone,
2 : Ok, that's fine.
3 : Yup
1 : And then, Silver Gate
2 : which is also gone.
3 : Yup
3 : Ok
2 : It's fine.
2 : Ok
2 : uh so my turn.
1 : So you just need to
1 : one, two, three
2 : Whoa
2 : whatever.
3 : Yeah
2 : And one, two,
2 : three.
2 : Uh, Temple of the Sun, goodbye.
2 : Misty Marsh, goodbye.
3 : Everything is sinking
2 : And Tidal Palace, goodbye.
3 : Ok
3 : so,
3 : now it's my turn.
2 : Yeah
1 : Can you like
3 : I can
1 : Do you do the-
3 : I think I have to make one
3 : action, right?
2 : You
1 : Ok, then you can just
2 : It's only up to three actions, so you can shore, shore that up.
1 : You can uh do that
3 : Shore that
2 : Alright
1 : Mmhmm, and that, that can be a
2 : And
3 : And then I can use- I mean I can just use a sandbag or you can go now.
3 : We can just win.
1 : Oh you have to
3 : Oh yeah, oh no
3 : Ok
3 : so
3 : I'll just replace these with exactly what I just got
3 : and then I need to do three.
3 : Howling Garden,
3 : uh Cliffs of Abandon,
3 : and Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Alright
3 : There we go, ok
1 : Ok, move one- So, ok, so Lift our team.
2 : We win
1 : Ok
2 : Yay we win
3 : Do we like actually have to lift them off?
3 : Ok

1 : Ok
1 : um
1 : so
1 : what do you guys think I should do? I guess we should look at each other's
4 : Um, well you do have- You have two of the chalices
4 : so that could be
2 : I think you wanna start shoring up some
4 : You can
1 : Yeah
2 : Some (places)
4 : being, being that you're the Engineer. (--) to kinda put that power to work, yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Um, so I can go- Well I can only- Cause these two are the only adjacent ones to me
4 : Right
2 : Right
1 : Ok so I can do
1 : those two
2 : That would be one turn. Or one move, rather- One action
1 : Yeah
4 : One action, yup.
1 : Um
4 : You can move and then shore up again
4 : would be all your three actions.
1 : Oh yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : That's a good idea
1 : Two
1 : and then three.
2 : Good.
4 : Two treasure cards
1 : Ok, so Water's Rise
4 : Mm good start
1 : And
1 : one of the fire
1 : Crystal fire
4 : Ok so you've already got one of those.
1 : Yes
4 : Just planning ahead.
4 : Alright
1 : Ok
2 : (--)
4 : And then, two flood cards.
2 : Wait so put these guys at back in here
1 : Yeah
4 : (You had) those out from
1 : Mm this goes over there
4 : Yeah
2 : Goes to the discard
3 : And then take your flood cards
2 : We pick two flood cards
1 : Ok, Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate
4 : Well
4 : you wanna pass me the Gold Gate
4 : It's gone
4 : That's not too bad
2 : One, two, three
2 : Ok we didn't lose one of these guys. That's what I was asking
3 : Messenger
1 : Was there anything on the Gold- Ok
4 : No,
4 : no it was just
4 : And at the
4 : default for one of the yellow- whatever that is
1 : (--)
2 : Alright
4 : Yeah
2 : Alright here we go
2 : Alright let's see here
4 : One, two
4 : No
4 : Is that
4 : Ok, Lost Lagoon, maybe you'd wanna get towards that and shore that up
2 : Ok
4 : Um just because there's not
2 : One, two
2 : That's fine
4 : really any other
4 : goal for you at the moment.
2 : Cause I could go here for one and then here to two and then I could shore it up with three.
4 : Although
4 : yeah.
4 : Unless anyone has a better idea. The other thing would be maybe if you wanna try starting to collect the
2 : The red card?
4 : the red ones.
2 : Or the yellow ones. One of the two
4 : Yeah
4 : Um
1 : Um
4 : I'd say don't wo- I would go ahead and
2 : Well Lost Lagoon doesn't really have anything on it, so
4 : Well
4 : that's a good point too actually.
2 : So if I come over to the red
2 : that would be one move and then we could do
2 : two would be she could
4 : She can't give you a card
3 : Mmhmm
3 : You would give your red card
2 : I have to give a card- Oh I have to give a card. Ok so
1 : It has to be on my- Yeah
2 : I could give
2 : you my,
2 : my lion
3 : That would be a good card- That would be a better move
4 : Yeah and then I can try to get over here eventually
2 : And then I could, and then I could move another spot closer to the red and then maybe I could collect
4 : Yeah so
1 : Yeah
4 : Well do you need to be,
2 : (--)
4 : do you need to be on top of my
2 : Oh yeah, so I'd have to move over. Sorry
4 : Yeah so that would, that would be one, two, three.
3 : As the Messenger I don't think she has to be
4 : Oh yeah what's your specific power though?
2 : I can give a card to anyone
2 : I can give a card at any time for one of my actions. I don't even have to be on a
4 : Oh, ok
2 : thing. So I could actually
4 : Yeah
2 : I could almost give two cards away, but
4 : Give me that one
2 : that'll do.
4 : and then you can
2 : There's one
3 : and then take a move, so one action
4 : One
4 : and then start moving over towards
2 : I can move
4 : either of these.
2 : I can move towards Breaker's Bridge. Go one, two
4 : Sure
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
2 : Two treasure cards
2 : sandbag
2 : and another one of those
3 : lions
4 : Oh ok so you can
4 : give that next time.
2 : And then
2 : yeah. Ok, and then we got
2 : two of these.
2 : Got Phantom Rock
3 : It's here. That's gonna sink
2 : Well that's gone.
4 : Alright.
2 : And then Temple
2 : on the Moon.
3 : Yeah
2 : Or of the Moon, rather. Sorry
4 : Ok that one's important.
3 : That's
3 : on the red.
4 : And we wanna keep track of what's in that
4 : little pile before we recycle it
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
4 : or
4 : put them on top.
3 : Mmkay
4 : Alright
4 : that's it right?
2 : Yeah
2 : Yup that's me.
3 : Alright
4 : K
2 : It's your turn, Pilot.
3 : Pilot turn
3 : Oh I think I might need to go to the Temple of the Moon and shore that up since I can
3 : fly.
3 : once per turn.
4 : You could. You could also just kinda
1 : Yeah
4 : double down on that and just try to use this one.
3 : What do you mean?
4 : Like even, even if that one goes away, we still have that.
1 : Cause there's not a
3 : Oh
3 : (--) true.
4 : But it that doesn't really matter because you're, you're right you can fly anywhere so distance doesn't really play in.
4 : You could use the Lift to move anyone else
3 : Mm
4 : if there's a good place for somebody else to move.
2 : I think you should hold onto that for now.
4 : Yeah
4 : I agree
2 : Um
2 : I would think that since we don't have any cards, enough cards to pick up a treasure
2 : that we should shore up as many of these
4 : Mmhmm
2 : cards as we can because-
2 : Especially the Temple of the Moon because if you start losing cards in the middle you're gonna start losing places to swim to.
3 : (--)
4 : It'd be good to have
1 : Yeah
4 : Now is there any disdvantage to losing a card like this? Like it might even be in our best interest just to like lose the useless ones on the outside, yeah.
1 : Let it happen
2 : Right, that's why I was saying
2 : the one in the middle I think we should shore up rather than
4 : Yeah
4 : Right, right
2 : than
3 : Ok
4 : So that's, that would be two actions. Move, shore up
3 : So one action and shore up, correct?
3 : And then I have an action left but I don't have to necessarily take an action.
4 : You don't need to, yeah.
4 : Um
3 : (Why don't)
4 : Unless you wanna try to
4 : get ready to give this-
4 : I would, yeah
4 : I would say not worry about it.
2 : You could
2 : Yeah you could just stay where you are.
1 : Yeah
1 : cause you're already there.
4 : Cool
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Take your two treasure cards then
3 : Mm, let's see what we get today
4 : K, so we wanna get that to you eventually and then Helicopters.
1 : Perfect
3 : And then, two waters please.
3 : City or Cliffs of Abandon
3 : and Breaker's
3 : Bridge.
4 : Breaker's Bridge is here
3 : (--)
3 : was here.
4 : Alright so those in particular we definitely want to keep
4 : shored up.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
4 : Um
3 : Um
4 : So
4 : now you, you can only deliv- Like use your Messenger power during your turn, right?
2 : That's right, as one of my actions.
4 : Ok, ok.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : I can start moving
4 : towards one of these.
4 : Or, or being the Explorer I can use my power to
2 : Mm mm mm
2 : What's your power?
3 : You can move diagonal
4 : I can, I can move, yeah diagonally and
3 : That's cool
2 : You could shore up diagonally too right?
4 : So I could, I could move here
4 : shore that up and then shore that up would be my three actions.
2 : Yup
4 : And then I can still get here quickly.
2 : I think that's
2 : a good idea.
4 : Alrighty
3 : Ok
2 : Where do you want Breaker's Bridge?
4 : Oh, yeah, sorry.
2 : So
4 : Uh and then two treasure cards
4 : Thanks
4 : Alright
3 : Wait are you green or gray?
4 : Green
2 : He's green, I'm gray.
3 : Ok
4 : I, I moved here to flip that and then I didn't move her back afterwards.
3 : Ok
2 : So you're at your max with five
2 : Ok
1 : Yes
4 : Right
4 : Should try to get rid of the ones I don't need.
1 : Yeah
4 : Whispering Garden and Iron Gate.
3 : Iron Gate
4 : Iron Gate we don't really need to worry about
3 : No
1 : Ok
1 : um so I need to try and get close to one of the
1 : ocean things.
4 : The two of us have ocean
4 : things.
2 : So you're red
2 : His, his, you're blue. Pilot right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yes
4 : We're basically all on top of each other
2 : Can you guys give each other anything or can you give him- No
1 : Well you have to
2 : Wait what?
3 : She can give away a card, or cards.
2 : If you want me to collect the,
2 : collect the fire you can move onto mine and collect the fire
2 : and shore up the Lost Lagoon.
1 : Um
2 : Or
2 : you could do something different
4 : Maybe
1 : Wait, I'm sorry. Do you have to be um
1 : on
1 : one of the
1 : like
1 : like do I have to be here to give this to you or can I just give this to you?
2 : No you have to be on the same
1 : The same one as you?
3 : S
2 : The- You have to be on the same space as me, to give it to me.
3 : Space as her
4 : Right
1 : Oh ok.
1 : Ok
4 : The other thing would be if we can try to shorten the total number of turns it takes to get these, that's better.
1 : Oh that complicates things
4 : So
4 : you could
4 : try to give those two to me.
4 : By the time it gets around to you, you could give one- that to me
4 : and then
4 : I could on my turn
1 : Collect it.
4 : go on two and collect that.
3 : collec the treasure.
1 : Yeah
4 : Just cause if we, if we try to wait for it to go all the way around again, that's more
1 : Time consuming.
3 : S it might- Something might sink.
4 : It's more time consuming and more flooding.
1 : Yeah
4 : Except I would need to get rid of these.
2 : When you, yeah when you get five and you get another one you have to discard one.
4 : Cause I have five, we didn't think of that.
3 : Mm
4 : Right
4 : Ok, we didn't think of that.
3 : So maybe
3 : maybe she should hold onto her chalice cards and then we give them to her?
4 : Yeah
2 : And she could work towards
2 : down here
1 : Yeah, that's what I was thinking
4 : One, two, three
1 : initially.
2 : Cause if you are- Cause if you came here
4 : I would- Maybe you could do one, two, three to get there
2 : You could give
4 : then on your turn
4 : you can go up,
4 : give your, give your chalice to her,
4 : I can
4 : go up too and give the chalice to her, and then I'm still only one away from the Gardens,
4 : if we would wanna try to use these
4 : later on.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : That make sense?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mm
1 : So um
1 : should I move
1 : over here so that I can give this to you
1 : and then- So that I
4 : What?
1 : Cause if I'm gonna receive those two I have to make sure I don't
1 : have five cards cause when I draw those I could collect one.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Also a good point, yeah.
1 : Ok so I'm gonna do that
1 : as one.
2 : (--)
4 : That's one
2 : That's one
4 : give it to her, and then just move one closer.
1 : And this is two
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : and then three
3 : Alright
4 : Cool
1 : Ok
1 : and then those two
4 : Mm
1 : Water's Rise
3 : Hmm
4 : Ok
1 : Um ok so this comes up one so now we're at three
1 : and we
1 : put those back
1 : and also I got one of these guys.
3 : We'll need to
3 : shuffle those.
1 : Um
1 : ok that's a lot of them
1 : but none of them are Coral Palace.
1 : And then this comes back over there
4 : Which, which in particular in there are
4 : flooded right? Whispering Garden is in there
3 : And that one
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Whispering Garden is one
1 : um
2 : all the ones that are currently flooded are in this pile
4 : Ok
2 : (--)
1 : but there's also ones that are
4 : That makes sense plus some others.
1 : Yeah, like this guy I think, but none of them are this one.
2 : Except for (--)
2 : Right
1 : I believe
3 : Mm
4 : Alright
4 : that's not too bad then
2 : (--) need to pick up your three cards
1 : K
1 : Oh yes
1 : Ok
1 : So, Breaker's Bridge, Lost Lagoon, and Iron Gate. Ok so Lost Lagoon is gone
4 : Iron Gate is gone
1 : Iron Gate is gone, ok so that's not a huge
2 : And what was the other one?
1 : lost.
1 : Um, Breaker's Bridge
1 : However
2 : Where's Breaker's Bridge?
2 : Right here.
4 : Right there
1 : The um
1 : so like you said now that those two are gone those cards are also out so now it increases the likelihood that we're gonna draw something that'll be like of consequence
3 : Mmhmm
1 : and lose it.
2 : Yeah
4 : That's a great point.
2 : I still have sandbags we can use sandbags too.
4 : And that can do anywhere, right?
2 : This can be at any time.
4 : Ok
3 : And at any time, yes
1 : What does that do?
2 : I can shore up any tile on the island. I can play it at any time
4 : You need to shore it up
2 : Does not count as any action
2 : You just discard it over there, so I mean
1 : Ok, so it's just to shore up something but it's not a bring the island back to life card.
2 : Like
2 : right, we could sh-
2 : Right we can shore up Whispering Gardens at any time. You know, whatever
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Al-
2 : Alright so it's my turn now so
2 : let's see.
2 : I want
4 : Wanna try to go
2 : Do I wanna give you my
2 : my yellow lion and get rid of the
3 : (--)
2 : purple
1 : Well he can't
3 : He already has five
4 : I can just get rid of one of these, you know I
1 : accept anymore cards.
2 : Yeah you'd have to discard the purple
3 : Ok
3 : That's true, we only need three treasures
4 : Yeah that's
1 : Well I don't know if you get rid of them at the moment, then we're
1 : we only need three to win, right?
1 : Cause I have- So that's one, two, three four of the purple, and one, two, three, four of the green, and then one, two, three of the gold
3 : Correct
4 : Right, so we
3 : Mm
4 : Yeah we could just
4 : double down and just
4 : not worry about those.
4 : Might make it simpler.
1 : Maybe
2 : Ok I'll keep- Ok.
4 : Have we,
4 : have we had any of the fire ones get
4 : flipped at all?
2 : Nnhmm
4 : Cause other thing those are probably way down in the deck
2 : Maybe
1 : Yeah that's true
3 : Hmm
4 : Um
4 : let's not, let's- Well hold on
2 : And there's, there's tons of these, so I mean you're gonna get all kinds of duplicates so even if you discard one you'll draw another one.
4 : Yeah
4 : right.
1 : Mm
4 : Ok
4 : well let's go for,
4 : let's try to do the, the earth stone
4 : the
4 : chalice here and the wind one for now.
2 : Ok
4 : I think that, that would make it a little bit simpler
2 : Alright
2 : Would you like me to
2 : We'll see uh- um what color am I? I'm gray, ok so.
2 : I can shore up Breaker's Bridge
4 : K
1 : I think that's a good idea.
2 : And I can move up towards Whispering Garden- Or I can just use my sandbag and just
2 : shore up Whispering Garden.
4 : Um
4 : I would say save that in case we really, really need it.
2 : Ok
4 : Cause we still do have two of these, we still have two of all of them, so then we might wanna keep that just in case
2 : Ok, I'll shore up Breaker's Bridge
2 : and then
2 : I can move onto
4 : Shore up Breaker's Bridge, maybe give me one of
2 : But if I give you one then I'm getting- You're either getting rid of
4 : I- We would lose any of these, ok.
2 : Right
2 : I don't think that that's a good idea right now.
3 : But
4 : Yes and
3 : Sorry to interrupt
2 : (What) were we thinking?
4 : No go for it
3 : We might have one of the Whispering- She's gonna draw three of those flood cards. We might lose
3 : a garden,
3 : so I'm like
1 : Yeah
3 : It'd be time to use the sandbag
1 : I would say I agree I think we should use the sandbag
4 : That
1 : because there's probably
1 : like there are a ton of cards and there's probably more
1 : and right now- Basically right now we need this and we don't necessarily need this for something other than
1 : this
1 : because
1 : it's three
4 : You-
4 : And you'd rather use this than just try to get that.
4 : You think it's worth
1 : Well
1 : I think it's
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
1 : Cause this one's also in here,
2 : Yeah well
4 : Yeah
1 : in the recent one. So if we lose both of them- And these are only gonna increase and if we lose both of them the n that's completely out for something we're already trying to work on.
4 : Sure
4 : that makes sense.
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna flip this guy over, but this doesn't count as one of my actions, so I can just do that and flip that one over.
4 : Right
1 : Yeah
2 : And then I can
2 : shore up this guy here.
4 : Yup
2 : This would be action number one
2 : Is there any place you want me to go towards?
2 : I can go towards Fool's Landing, I can
2 : I don't
1 : Um
4 : I don't think there's much, much of an imperative
2 : Or I can come down towards Howling Garden in case it gets,
2 : it gets flooded. I can flip it
1 : And you have to shore it up
4 : Yeah, why don't you just move one, two, so that you're next to it anyway.
1 : Yeah that's a good idea.
3 : That's a good spot.
4 : And then, cool
1 : Perfect
1 : Ok
4 : Go ahead with the treasure deck.
3 : Alright
3 : Ahp
3 : yeah
2 : I got another sandbag
2 : and I got another
1 : Perfect
3 : Uh
3 : Awesome
4 : Alright so now we have four of these
2 : And then I gotta
2 : pull some of these
1 : Yes
2 : flooded
4 : Uh
2 : cards, three of em.
3 : Uh
3 : We could skip that but (--)
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Well, ok
1 : That's this guy.
2 : Uh Whispering Garden
3 : Hmm
2 : And
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : which is under the blue one.
3 : So that one again
3 : Man
3 : Alright
4 : Alright
2 : (--)
4 : You need to get
4 : that
4 : to her.
3 : Ok
3 : That would be one action
2 : And you could, and you could shore up both of these ones with your other two actions.
3 : I can
3 : I could arbitrarily- These two.
4 : Well you need to get onto her space, to give her the, the chalice.
3 : Well
2 : Oh
3 : No
4 : So that's- Now you can, you can move anywhere on the map for just one move right?
2 : One, two
3 : One
3 : Yes
4 : K
2 : Yeah cause you can fly anywhere
3 : Ok
2 : So you could shore up both of those
3 : So I shore up here as one
3 : and then
3 : move
2 : Oh right
4 : and then give her
3 : and then give her the card.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : That sounds good.
2 : I think that sounds good.
3 : Ok
4 : Now flip that
3 : Shore up
3 : Fly
4 : There
2 : Give her a card
3 : (--)
1 : Thank you
3 : Chalice
3 : That's three
3 : So now I get my
3 : treasure cards.
4 : Now let's
4 : take it.
4 : Alright
3 : The last thing's three flood cards please
3 : Copper Gate,
4 : Right here.
4 : It's not terribly important
3 : Crimson Forest,
4 : (--)
3 : Temple of the Sun.
1 : In the corner.
3 : Right here
4 : Alright, well that's not terrible
4 : Ok so I need to get this to you and I am
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
2 : You (gotta) move onto the spot with her
4 : Right
4 : so I'll just do that first.
4 : That's one,
4 : that's two
1 : Two
4 : and then
4 : I could shore up Cliffs of Abandon
4 : but there might be better-
4 : Actually not a whole lot else I can do.
2 : I think you should do that cause you're gonna need it to go back up to Whispering Gardens and I have a sandbag we can still
3 : Yeah we could
4 : If you wanna go up there
2 : Shore up Whispering Garden at any time, so
2 : We could do both things
4 : Cool
4 : K and
3 : Well Whispering Garden's still in the discard pile. Is it in threat at the time?
2 : (--)
1 : Yeah we'll probably draw another one really soon.
2 : Yes uh
4 : Alright
2 : That's a good point I can hold onto it
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah, that's three for me so I'll take two of the treasure cards.
3 : Alright
4 : Hold on, uh
4 : I guess I have to get rid of one.
4 : Well alright, we got a Water's Rise, so
2 : If I can play this at any time I can play it right now and flip over Whispering Garden
2 : Your card's over here, your flood cards.
4 : Yeah I don't
4 : I don't know if we can break the third wall, but
4 : their uh the rule is that
4 : you have to use this immediately and I don't know if that means you can swoop in with the sandbag
4 : um
4 : before
2 : Well, yeah but you don't, yeah but you can
2 : I don't know what the rules are but you could
4 : That's, that's kinda what I'm asking, yeah
2 : But, but that doesn't force you to draw all these cards so you can finish, we can put these back in the discard, and it- and before you draw all these things you can use it
4 : Oh yeah, ok, ok
4 : Good, I like that
2 : It doesn't say anything about
2 : Play at any time it says
3 : Bless
4 : Right
4 : Alright
1 : Yeah
4 : Move that up,
4 : shuffle that in,
4 : and then we'll discard that.
2 : If you wanna use my sandbag we can use the Whispering Gardens.
4 : Um
3 : ok yeah.
4 : What did
4 : And you think you'd wanna use the sandbag rather than
4 : (--) is Howling Gardens in there?
2 : Yes
4 : Like on top? It is, ok
1 : Yes
1 : so is that guy.
3 : Ok
4 : Temple of the Sun
1 : Um
4 : We can use Moon- Well both of those are actually in there.
4 : Ok, we gotta- Alright
4 : Yeah, why don't we, why don't we use the sandbag?
3 : So which one do we wanna save?
4 : That's (a good)- actually a good
3 : The
3 : the Garden or the Sun?
2 : Or we just hold onto it and just
4 : Yeah, that might be the smarter bet
2 : Alright
2 : Alright, well then here's your
4 : Three of em
2 : three cards.
4 : Alright, well
3 : Hmm
1 : Well
1 : we lost.
4 : Eh you can't win em all. Cliffs of Abandon and Copper Gate those aren't too bad.
2 : Copper Gate's gone
3 : Copper Gate's gone
4 : Oh sorry
4 : Alright well
4 : (--) as you can get, so
2 : Alright so the first thing I think you wanna do is cap- Well you wanna move and then capture your treasure right?
1 : Yes
3 : Ok
4 : Yup
2 : Or do you wanna
2 : Wait, you're red right?
1 : Yes
4 : Shore up, move, capture.
2 : We could shore up Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Yeah
4 : That sounds good.
2 : Is that what you were thinking?
1 : Yeah
3 : One
2 : And then move would be two and then three would be capture the treasure.
3 : two
1 : K so I discard these guys.
4 : Alright
3 : Uh
2 : Yay one down
3 : One down, two to go
1 : Ok
4 : Ok now
2 : Here's your
2 : Do you wanna do something now?
4 : I'm just thinking about using that sandbag if we need it, but I think because that's not
4 : flooding
2 : We still need- The sandbag we can only use on Crimson Forest which at this point is completely out of
1 : Or Temple
1 : And I thin that we should do it
2 : Or Temple of the (--)
4 : Right
4 : So we don't do- So we don't lose that.
1 : Because we're closer
3 : To getting four
1 : Two- Well I guess
1 : at this point it depends who it is but like
1 : these two are
1 : um close to this one and these two are close to this one. They're both two spaces away.
1 : Um
2 : This one's closer to Fool's Landing
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : Uh why don't we do it?
2 : Let's do it
2 : Alright, here's your um
2 : two treasure cards
1 : Thank you
1 : Ok cool
1 : So I got another one of these
1 : and a Helicopter
4 : K so we have plenty of these we also have plenty of Helicopter Lifts, we should start
3 : (--)
1 : So
2 : You have Helicopters. We can move people around. And you need your three
3 : Uh uh uh- True
1 : Yeah
2 : Floods
3 : And they can be played at anytime
4 : Right
2 : Mmhmm
4 : And we do have
4 : bunch of people on the same
4 : and you can use that to move multiple people.
3 : True
1 : Ok so we got Temple of the Sun
2 : What'd you get?
1 : Uh Temple of the Moon
4 : Oh
3 : Mm
1 : And Breaker's Bridge
4 : Alright
4 : that's not too bad.
2 : Except these two are both flooded.
1 : Yeah
2 : If we wanna go after those
3 : We do have four
1 : I think we should
3 : cards out.
2 : Alright
3 : Four
1 : Um I have three
4 : Well, total, we have enough of these.
3 : One on the same- Yeah we have enough to capture (--)
2 : Alright
1 : Oh
1 : Yeah
4 : Um
1 : we do.
4 : So
4 : You should use-
4 : Also the- All of these are useless from now on so once we get em we can just
2 : Yup so I can
1 : Yes
4 : So if you wanna get
1 : get rid of them.
4 : I can
2 : I can shore up some stuff.
1 : I think you should
4 : Yeah
2 : And I can give a card away too.
4 : I would say give maybe
4 : two of the
2 : I
4 : two of the statues to me
2 : I can do that
1 : Can you discard your
1 : green thing, like anytime?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah- Well when I give him a card he can discard it.
4 : There's no reason to, but I'll just get rid of it.
3 : When you get some more cards
1 : Yeah ok
1 : So I think you should do that
4 : And then I'll just get rid of one of these unfortunately.
1 : Yeah I think that's ok
1 : because if you
1 : if each of you give one of those to me
1 : if we are- Since we're all close right now and then on my next turn I move and get that guy that's another one as long as we can keep that from sinking.
4 : That's three.
4 : Yup, I like that.
2 : We don't have anymore sandbags.
4 : Well we'll just have to see what happens.
2 : Alright
1 : That is true
4 : So if you wanna use your Messenger power
2 : Ok
4 : and get those two gold statues to me
2 : Yup
2 : that's two actions, mmhmm
4 : And that's two of your actions, right? Ok
2 : And then the other option is
4 : And then we'll discard those for me
3 : Mmhmm
2 : I- You can- Someone could fly me over there cause that doesn't count as an action right, the Helicopter?
2 : And I could use my third action to save,
2 : to save this guy.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah I think that's a good idea.
1 : I'll do it.
2 : Ok
1 : because we know in the next- within the next round we're gonna get that as long as we keep that from
3 : (--)
4 : It's gonna be gone, yeah.
1 : sinking.
2 : right
1 : So I think we should do that.
4 : Cool
2 : Alright
3 : Did you already draw? Ok
2 : No I haven't yet. Alright I got- Ha now I have four
1 : Oh
2 : of the little fire things.
4 : And we still have a Lift so we could
3 : And we have a Helicopter
2 : and then
2 : Yeah let me grab these guys here
2 : I guess
4 : As long as we can survive that long
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright here we go
3 : Yes
2 : Silver Gate,
2 : that's up there.
4 : That's a new one.
2 : Tidal palace
2 : it's over there.
2 : But we already have that
4 : Yeah that's, that's not bad.
2 : So that's, that's ok
2 : And Crimson Forest
1 : Bye
2 : Oh, there you go.
4 : This is exciting.
1 : Yes
3 : Alright
2 : Alright Pilot
3 : So I need to give this
1 : To me
2 : Are you guys on the same
3 : to the ex- Engineer. No we're not
4 : to your right
1 : What's- Which one's yours?
2 : You're the blue
3 : I'm blue
1 : Ok
2 : So you would have to move here for one
1 : So you should move one
2 : And then you'd have to give her two
3 : Ok
1 : Thank you
3 : Good plan
2 : And if you're gonna go after this guy on your next turn
2 : And you're gonna go on your next turn
4 : I can move, give it to her, then move
2 : then the next thing would be to get off the island, right?
4 : Yeah
3 : So I can make a move
2 : Or you could
2 : Well you can fly anywhere so you could go
3 : Either way
2 : somewhere and
3 : Well I wouldn't be able to shore it up
2 : Right
3 : cause I already took two actions, but I could
3 : I could go there
3 : to shore it up next time.
2 : If something would happen
3 : If I'm still,
1 : Which one?
3 : if we're still
1 : To where?
2 : He could shore
3 : To any, any of the flooded ones
2 : To anywhere
4 : Um
4 : the most important one would be
4 : actually none of- I mean
1 : I don't think so, I think
4 : None of those are really imperative
3 : Cause we're gonna fly
3 : the Engineer to
3 : wherever
2 : You could just go to Fool's Landing
3 : I can just go there
2 : Or,
4 : Um
4 : I- We don't- we wanna make sure
2 : or would you just rather him stay put?
1 : Yeah I think you should
4 : We wanna make sure we keep this too.
1 : do that.
1 : Yeah
3 : Mm
2 : Mmhmm
3 : True
1 : So you might wanna go there
2 : But you're going there on the next turn anyways
4 : Yeah, un- I mean, I can either go there and get it which is probably what we'll do but then I won't be able to get this to her,
4 : although we do have Lift.
3 : Mm
2 : Mmhmm
4 : But we can only use one though, cause we need to keep one.
1 : For getting to Fool's LAnding
3 : To get off
1 : Oh to get off
4 : Ok we can use that to get me here, I can get it, I can move back
2 : Mmhmm, mm
4 : and then I can give that to you.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : So that's three, ok so
2 : Right
3 : I can just stay put
4 : that's
4 : yeah.
2 : Ok
4 : Why don't we just do that?
3 : Mmkay
1 : Ok
3 : Stay put, take two cards
4 : Nobody has more than five, right?
3 : Lion and the rock
1 : No
2 : Nope
3 : And then three flood cards
3 : Bronze Gate,
3 : Cave of Shadows,
3 : mm
4 : Cave of Shadows
2 : Right here
1 : This (--)
3 : And then Dunes of Deception down in the corner.
3 : Alright
4 : Alright
4 : not too bad.
3 : You may only have- I have six cards
2 : Who
4 : Oh wait- We weren't counting those. Ok, get rid of the
4 : fire one
2 : Get
2 : Get rid of the fire or the- yeah the fire one
4 : One, two, three, four, five, alright
1 : Yeah
3 : Sounds good
2 : Thank you
2 : I had forgot the Helicopters counted.
4 : (--) yeah
4 : Alright um so my turn we want to use one of the Helicopters to get me here
3 : Me too
2 : Yup
4 : and that's not an action
2 : yup
3 : Correct
4 : And then I'll get this
4 : Discard those
4 : second action, move here, third action, give that to you.
2 : Good
4 : K
2 : that's good, alright.
3 : Yes no Water Rise
4 : Misty Marsh, Howling Garden,
4 : which we don't
4 : need anymore. And Cave of Embers
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
4 : K so we wanna
1 : Ok so now I just
2 : We wanna move I think one, two, right?
3 : Move two
4 : One, two
1 : Yup
1 : so one, two, and then three
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Get this guy
1 : thank you.
4 : Alright, now we wanna
3 : No
4 : get outta here.
1 : And then yeah
4 : We're probably gonna get
1 : Um
3 : um
2 : (--)
3 : was that three
1 : When do we go- yeah, it is three. When do we go to Fool's Landing? Oh I got a Helicopter card too.
3 : actions?
3 : Yeah
3 : Right now.
4 : Yeah we got, we got three.
1 : Is there any reason we can't go right now?
2 : We'd have to, I think we'd have to move all of our pieces there and then we'd have to Helicopter Lift off.
4 : We have to move there.
1 : We all have to be there?
1 : It's not just one of us? Ok
3 : Do you- Did you say you got a Helicopter?
4 : Right
2 : (--)
1 : Yes
2 : But she also got a Water's Rise
3 : Oh but she also got a Water's Rise
1 : Ok so Water's Rise
2 : So you need to move that
2 : little
2 : ticker thing up one.
1 : We're still at three.
4 : One, two, one, two
3 : Alright
4 : As long as we don't lose Fool's Landing
2 : Well Fool's Landing hasn't even- It's still in the pile down there so we're still good.
4 : in this next
4 : Yeah, I guess you're right.
2 : It's tough once that comes up, I would think.
4 : Yeah, we kinda lucked out.
2 : Right, now you need three of those I guess
4 : And we got five minutes
1 : Ok, Breaker's Bridge, Cities of Abandon, and Temple of the Moon.
2 : Breaker's Bridge,
1 : Cities of Abandon, and Temple of the
4 : And this one's gone.
3 : Or Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Not cit- no Cities, not Cliffs, cities.
3 : Oop Cities
3 : Is there a Cities?
4 : Really?
1 : Ah nope, it's Cliffs, sorry.
2 : Oh Cliffs
3 : See
3 : I read Cities once and it stuck.
1 : Yeah, ok
2 : And then the other one is Temple of the Moon.
4 : Temple of the Moon's out
3 : Ok
4 : What was the third one?
2 : This is out too, Breaker's Bridge.
4 : Ok
2 : There we go
4 : Cool
4 : It's ok
3 : Messenger
2 : Alright
2 : so now it's my turn right? So
4 : Yup
2 : I just need to get to Fool's Landing.
4 : And I would just get onto Fool's Landing. Get onto Fool's Landing, shore something up if you want.
2 : I don't need the Helicopter Lift to get there, I can just go onto
1 : Ok
2 : yeah.
2 : Right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Mm, maybe- Why don't you shore this up?
4 : Just in case
2 : Good idea, thank you
1 : Just for fun.
2 : Alright that's my three, ok
4 : (--)
2 : I got a bunch of extra pieces that I don't need at all.
4 : Ah
2 : And then
2 : alright
2 : Silver Gate,
2 : (--)
4 : Silver Gate
2 : Howling Garden,
2 : and Cave of Shadows.
2 : Oh the one you- I- we just shored up, that was a good call.
4 : Oh
2 : There you- Oh this goes over here, sorry.
4 : Ah keep that, yeah
2 : Alright
4 : K
2 : It's your turn Pilot
3 : Ok
4 : So hop on over there.
3 : So I'll fly myself
1 : Wait
1 : you should
1 : still shore up
3 : Oh I could shore that up
1 : Because if we get rid of these then we'll get closer to
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Yup
1 : doing Fool's Landing.
2 : So let's do both of-
2 : You wanna do both of them or do you just wanna move
2 : one and then
4 : Yeah
4 : I would say yeah, one, two, three
2 : Well I guess it doesn't- Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : It's- I don't think the specifics are super important.
2 : Good idea
2 : Alright
4 : K
2 : No Water's Rise
2 : What- Oh, sandbags.
3 : I only have the sandbags
4 : The sandbag, that's, that's good just incase.
2 : Ok
1 : Perfect
4 : Three of them
2 : What'd you get?
3 : Bronze Gate
3 : Tidal Palace
1 : That's gone.
3 : (--)
3 : And Temple of the Sun,
4 : No
3 : which is this one.
4 : Bronze Gate, Tidal Palace, Temple of the Sun, ok
4 : And
2 : Who's next?
3 : Explorer
4 : I am. I can
2 : Do we wanna shore this- Uh doesn't matter cause if it sinks you can move
4 : I'll, I'll
2 : Well you- That's not yours.
1 : That's my-
4 : Oh I'm sorry
1 : It's ok.
4 : I'll move here and then I'll just shore this up and shore this up cause I can do it diagonally.
3 : One, two
3 : three. That's three actions, that's good.
4 : That's that
2 : Ok, yeah cause you moved one, and then two and three.
4 : Mmhmm
4 : K,
4 : no biggie, three of those.
4 : Embers is out, Misty Marsh, also out.
2 : What's out?
4 : And Dunes of Deception
2 : Alright
2 : Alright Engineer
1 : Ok
1 : and then
1 : so I go one, two
2 : Then we use a Helicopter Lift to get off the
4 : And fly us out
3 : Mm, Helicopter. Woo hoo
1 : And then get us out of here
2 : Yay
2 : time's up.
2 : Do we win?

1 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : If I move
1 : shore up Whispering Gardens
2 : Yeah that's a good idea.
1 : Good idea yeah. I'm gonna let these just go.
2 : Yeah those are fine.
1 : Um any things that are on the perimeters
1 : um and maybe
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : what do you think?
2 : I, I think so yeah because that would
3 : Wouldn't you have
1 : Yeah try to keep the land mass together as far as possible.
2 : Yeah, yeah that's fine.
1 : Ok so that's that, now what else do I have to do here?
3 : Can you do you you have to move on and then shore it up.
1 : Move myself to one of these.
2 : Oh wait, wait.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : it can only be um
2 : it can only be adjacent cards. We have to leave Breaker's Bridge at the moment.
1 : What
3 : Yeah well if she moves there and then shores it up, then it's ok.
1 : Oh ok adjacent ok
2 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Uh huh
1 : Well this is adjacement then right? I can move here and then I have to
3 : If you want
2 : Yeah no now it goes here.
3 : Yes
1 : Move myself here? Is that it?
3 : That's
2 : mm
1 : Or do I
3 : four turns so
3 : You can
1 : Ok
3 : just stay on Whispering.
1 : Ok I can stay on Whispering Gardens, ok fine.
3 : Yup
2 : All good.
3 : Cause you did one, two, three.
1 : And then
1 : Then I have to
2 : Ah
2 : draw the Treasure Deck cards first and then the
1 : Draw Treasure Deck card, Ok
2 : the Flood cards so here's
2 : one and two and then here's
1 : (--) ok.
2 : One and two
1 : Chalice and
1 : Water Rise ok.
2 : Uh oh
1 : Ok so I have to (--)
2 : Oh
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : Mm ok so we go up one and we're still in normal but it probably won't be for long probably, then this goes
1 : Move the water level, shuffle the flood
1 : discard pile.
2 : That goes over to the
2 : discard
1 : ok fine
1 : Uh huh
3 : And then you shuffle those two
2 : Um
2 : Yeah
1 : Shuffle these
3 : or no
3 : the one the discard
1 : oh
1 : I'm sorry ok
3 : And then you just put them on top.
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
1 : Put
1 : what on top? Oh
3 : Um
3 : Those on top of the flood pile.
1 : Oh ok.
2 : Come on
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mm
2 : There we go
1 : Mm
1 : Oh they go on this ok fine, yeah alright fine.
2 : Yeah they go on top of there.
2 : Alright so then
3 : Ok
2 : move it equal to the water level which is three, or no sorry, two, two, two
3 : two
1 : It's two yeah
2 : Ah so then take two yeah
1 : Just take two of these ok
1 : Cliffs of Abandon and phantom Rock
1 : Ah hah
2 : Mm
1 : Cliffs of Abandon, what do I do with this?
2 : Well that's,that's sunk now.
1 : It's sunk oh that's right these are the sunk ones, so this, this is a mess.
1 : phantom Rock
2 : Yeah those
2 : that's over there.
1 : is
2 : Oh we gotta take this one too
1 : Ok
1 : phantom Rock is
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh thanks
2 : Um
2 : that falls yeah
1 : Where's phantom Rock?
2 : phantom Rock is (--)
1 : Ok that was gonna go two so that's ok this is a mess but the perimeter I'm not so much worried about.
2 : Ah it's on the edge. It's not the worst.
1 : So that goes
2 : Up
2 : there.
3 : Ok now it's your turn.
2 : Alright
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Hmm
2 : Here we go ok ah, wait (--) I'm over there.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I will move, let's move to
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
3 : (--)
1 : Mm
2 : Let's move to the Misty Marsh first
2 : Let's also move to
2 : The Copper
2 : Gate
2 : And let's move
2 : Let's go Tidal Palace
2 : And Treasure cards, what did I get?
2 : Sandbags is helpful
2 : Alright the Earth, another Earth stone
2 : Ah and what else (--)
2 : I think if like
2 : if we start to get
2 : more than one and especially if you draw two of the same one
1 : Yeah
2 : in addition to like if you drew a third
1 : Mmhmm
2 : or
2 : You drew two more um
3 : You're allowed to give them are we allowed to give them?
2 : Ah
2 : Oh man I should um
3 : Oh yeah give it up to three actions, never mind
2 : Ok um
2 : Yes like if you drew, if you drew
1 : one more
2 : Um
1 : Crystal
1 : Fire
2 : Yeah, yeah but like if you, ok
3 : Only if we're on the same tile you can do it(--) the same tile.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, like but um, if you, if you get three, even if you get two
2 : sort of like
2 : I think it'd be good to like kind of
1 : concentrate on that and get that off the board?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah like, like make that, make that
2 : piece
2 : yeah like make that like your goal and try to
1 : yeah yeah
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
2 : Um it would put ourself around that ok.
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um two Treasure cards alright so it floods, floods at two.
3 : See you pick
2 : (--) it
2 : Gold Gate and Whispering Garden
2 : Whispering Garden is a little
1 : Soggy
2 : A little soggy and Gold Gate
2 : is
2 : gone. Well there's
2 : there;s that.
2 : It happens to the best of us.
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
2 : ALright so this one goes
2 : like on top.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So should I find myself over here to save this one?
2 : What?
2 : Oh
2 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah what was it?
3 : So should I fly myself over there so we can save
3 : these?
2 : Yes
3 : Instead of getting sunk?
2 : Yes save or fly yourself to
2 : Um
2 : I would do
3 : Oh I can fly anywhere so
2 : I would fly here maybe because
2 : you can shore up that one, and shore up that one as well
2 : because
3 : Ok good choice, ok. And then I'll shore this one up
2 : I just
2 : I
2 : ok
2 : And then
3 : And I'll shore that one up and that's my three
2 : that would be up
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Let's get those Treasure cards going.
3 : One, two
3 : Ok
3 : And then two Flood
3 : Oh
3 : Breaker's Bridge
3 : and
3 : um Lost Lagoon
2 : Lost Lagoon
2 : Well good call, we almost lost it.
3 : Ok
2 : Not sure it would have been the biggest loss, but
2 : Well
3 : Right
3 : Either way
2 : It's still not good though to lose islands, to lose tiles.
1 : Mm
2 : (--)
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Engineer I think it's your turn
1 : Ok so um
1 : Two actually, oh I need it's cards I need not to be in proximity to
1 : the
2 : Well (--) like
2 : if you see that
3 : Right you have to if you want to do this you have to get you on this one or this one
1 : Yeah
1 : Oh ok fine so that's gonna to be
2 : Yeah
2 : No it would be smart for her to get to your tile though so she could
2 : take that Treasure card
2 : or like you could give to her
3 : Give it to her yeah
2 : Only if we're on the same tile though
2 : Ok
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Mm I can move, I can move twice right?
2 : (--)
3 : So you
3 : You can go up to three so
1 : Up to three ok
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : You can do like
3 : You could
2 : I don't know
2 : Um
3 : Save this one
1 : (--)
1 : Go to here?
2 : (--)
2 : Yeah I would say save Breaker's Bridge
3 : So shore Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ok shore this up. Alright
3 : And then you could just move to that and stay. You don't have to do three.
1 : Again
1 : Uh huh
1 : Ok that's fine ok
2 : Yeah
1 : And now I have to draw cards.
2 : Yeah two treasure and the water still at two thankfully.
1 : Alright
1 : Ok
1 : Well I now have three
2 : Awesome
3 : Ok
1 : Awesome so that's good we can't take that off right away, that's
2 : Awesome
2 : No because she has the fourth one
3 : I have to, you have to wait until my turn
1 : You have the fourth one,ok fine.
2 : And then
3 : And then you do two
2 : And
1 : Ok two of these ok
2 : Yeah two, two of the island cards
1 : Temple of the Moon, which is where? As I said I don't so much care for the perimeter. Iron Gate.
2 : That's
1 : Oh
2 : Oh right here.
1 : Ok so again those are things that I'm not all that
1 : concern or do those go here?
2 : (--) here
3 : Yeah they just go right on top.
2 : (--)
1 : Ok good enough cool.
2 : Alright
2 : my turn um
2 : What am I gonna do.
2 : Let's
2 : Actually I'm gonna
2 : I'm gonna probably stay in this half of the board unless
1 : Mm
2 : Something
2 : Is (--) down here cause I'm gonna go
2 : one
2 : two
2 : and shore this up cause I have two of these
2 : two Earth stone cards
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
2 : Ok so then
3 : Ok now we have
3 : Well go ahead
2 : Ok
2 : Ah Water's Rise, lovely ok
2 : I have a
2 : and a fire
2 : or a Statue of Wind
2 : I gotta raise the water level to three now
1 : Mm
2 : the Water's Rise goes here.
2 : And now I have
2 : I have five cards so
2 : the one I will discard will probably be the Sand or
3 : You can have up to five right?
2 : Yeah
2 : So like the one I will discard will be
2 : The Sandbag
2 : and ooo I'm going to do two actually
3 : Well you can use that before you pull for the
2 : Or
3 : Water you can use your Sandbag
2 : Oh
1 : Oh
2 : Oh ok
2 : Ok then
2 : Can I use that
2 : now
2 : or or is that
3 : can shore up any one tile before it sinks but can't be used if the Flood deck for sinking
3 : tile
1 : Mm
3 : has already been drawn.
3 : So yeah use it before you pull from the flood.
2 : Ok
2 : So then I will save
2 : the
3 : Does it have to be?
2 : I think it could be anyone.
3 : Yeah I think so.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok let's say the Lost Lagoon
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Makes sense yeah
2 : Alright so Sandbags goes to
2 : Where is this discarded? ok yeah
3 : I think that one and then you can pull now.
3 : Mm
3 : Oh shuffle
2 : Ok
3 : and then replace sorry.
3 : You already moved it up
2 : Alright
1 : Just getting us off the island and leaving the Treasures I take it is not an option.
2 : I if only, if only
1 : We ought like just screw this here.
3 : Ok so
2 : Alright
3 : I want to um give mine but she already has
3 : Alright the Engineer has five
2 : Well we have to try to (--) real quick.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Lost Lagoon again this can't
3 : Ok
3 : Good choice
2 : can't stay dry and Temple of the Moon. Dissapointed because
2 : I don't want to
1 : Mm
3 : Right
2 : I'm gonna fly all the way down
2 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Alright
2 : So these stay here.
1 : Hmm
2 : Go ahead Pilot
3 : Ok
3 : So since I'm on the same as
3 : Engineer I want to give her
3 : a ss..
2 : Ah I drew these two
1 : Right here
1 : But you need three, we're all in here yeah
3 : Three corresponding to the thing
2 : Three I'll
2 : Got it, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha
2 : Ok Iron Gate is gone but
1 : Mm yeah
3 : Mm ok
2 : Not, not the biggest concern
3 : Well yeah ok
3 : So
3 : Since I'm on the same is it worth
3 : getting rid of her um
3 : Water chalice in order for me to
3 : cause she can't have, Engineer can't have more than five cards.
2 : Um
1 : Oh you mean this also counts so I now have
3 : No
1 : Not two, no this doesn't
3 : Well I'm on the same as you so I'd like to give you
2 : Oh you have
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah, yeah ok
2 : I think
2 : I think that's a good idea because there's only
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok so I'm gonna give you this and you can discard this
2 : Two
1 : So I
2 : yeah
2 : There's only two chalices, now there's only one on the that table we have
1 : Ok (--)
3 : And you have four right now so I'm going to
2 : Three
1 : So we have this ok
2 : Well I don't think
2 : Or we
3 : Well
1 : Well I have a total of five
2 : I will give you
2 : I will give you this card
2 : when it's my turn
3 : Ok so that was one turn
2 : Yeah
3 : And
3 : I can (--)
3 : move
3 : both of us to some other place. So can't I move
3 : both of us to here and?
1 : Yeah where?
3 : or no?
3 : to
2 : to maybe
2 : Maybe
3 : where am I looking like here?
1 : (--)
1 : Why are we trying to do that, what's our goal right now?
3 : So you're set up so you can take that right away for my for your next turn.
2 : Crystal of Fire
1 : Yeah uh huh
2 : Yeah, yeah that would be helpful
3 : So I'm gonna use this and then move
3 : both of us to right here
1 : Ok
3 : So that's my second turn
3 : And then
3 : I guess my
3 : well where was I before? No I'm fine.
2 : You were we
2 : you guys were both on the Whispering Garden I think
1 : Oh
1 : Or was it here?
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah I mean (--) ok
2 : It , it was
2 : Yeah, yeah
1 : (--)
3 : It's ok if we lose Lagoon
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Um
3 : What should my third move be?
2 : Um
3 : What else can I do?
3 : Move
3 : Or give a Treasure card but you said you wanted to give you this so I hold on
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah I'll give you these (--) when I get a round to it
3 : So should I move toward
2 : Um
2 : Yeah I mean I can
3 : Ok
3 : Go ahead
1 : Ok
3 : I got a
1 : Ah
2 : I can do anywhere on the island so you don't have to be close to me.
3 : Cool
2 : Yeah pull two
3 : Two
2 : Well awesome I see a change going on
3 : Ok and three
2 : Ah and then three (--)
3 : Howling Garden
2 : Ooo
3 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Mm
2 : (--) than I was expecting
3 : and Whispering Garden
1 : Oh wow
3 : Alright
2 : Alright changing the landscape of the game
1 : I can move th-
3 : So you are already on so you want to take the
3 : Fire right away
2 : Yeah
1 : Take the Fire
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah and then
1 : And give you these?
2 : Yeah thos just go to
1 : Ok
3 : Do then go here or here?
2 : Um
1 : I don't know.
3 : I don't know, try one.
1 : Over there.
1 : Cause those are lost or sunk territory.
2 : Yeah those are those are
2 : island tiles um
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright
1 : Ok so we have this
2 : Ah I think
2 : I think
2 : then move two might be like
3 : Yeah treasure card
1 : So move
2 : Ah
2 : Ah
1 : On the chal-
1 : Does somebody have the chalice card? is that it? No?
2 : No I don't
2 : I think we can
1 : Think so not really
2 : At the moment we could probaby go without the chalice because
1 : Mmhmm
2 : We had to
2 : Discard one of them to get your room for
1 : Right ok so total we have three of the ah the
2 : All the Fires
1 : Statue cards among us
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Um
2 : Yes
2 : I was, I was thinking maybe like
1 : Mm
2 : That
2 : that one would take too much
2 : or it would require too many spaces.
3 : Well we have to
1 : Yeah both this is a problem yeah
3 : So sh-
2 : Yeah (--)
3 : So Engineer should go over to and
2 : Yeah
1 : Two over to there and shore this up. Ok
2 : (--)
2 : Yeah
3 : And then
3 : Well
2 : well it would be a move to there
1 : Move to here yeah
2 : And then
3 : That would be three right?
1 : Right
2 : And the third move is shoring up yeah
3 : Right third move is shore
1 : Alright
1 : That's what I'm thinking ok fine.
2 : There we go. Ok that's better, that's better.
3 : Ok good choice.
1 : Ok
2 : Um
1 : I need you to move again.
3 : Ok s-
1 : No I've got done with moving so I have to take these. This is cool.
3 : No you're done.

2 : Ok
2 : (--) cause yeah I don't want to be stranded up in there.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And then

2 : Ok so
3 : Ok
2 : Alright then
2 : Let's see what the treasure has for me

3 : Mm
2 : Not the
2 : the best thing in the word um
2 : Whispering Gardens is also gone.
3 : Oh no
1 : Ok wow this is looking dicey
2 : Well let's ah
1 : And
3 : Ok
2 : And Howling Gardens is
2 : a bit soffy as they say so

3 : And did you
1 : Mm
3 : you get
3 : You're good so

2 : Yes good call, good call
1 : Mm
3 : Ok
3 : And then I want to
3 : which one do you want?
2 : Um
3 : Well this one
2 : I'll take ah
3 : I can give you
3 : and then you can discard the Fire since we already have the Fire.
2 : Are you, are you able to give it to me
2 : Yeah are you
3 : Oh no I can't
2 : No not
2 : You could use your Helicopter
3 : I can
2 : to meet me up at the Temple of the Moon.
3 : Move all of
2 : Maybe?
2 : or
3 : just
2 : just yourself?
2 : Maybe ah I don't know um
3 : Yeah I can do that
2 : Ok
3 : I'm hoping we won't get another one
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok so that's that's first move.
3 : Ok so that's my first move and then I'm gonna give you this and then you can get rid of the fire.
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah
2 : Second move
2 : I would discard the fire
3 : That's my second move
3 : and then
2 : third move um
3 : Sss-
3 : Save Crimson
2 : I'll, I'll all up to you I mean
1 : Mm
3 : I would start moving toward something else
2 : but I, I haven't seen a Misty Marsh in a while which means I think it's gonna do
3 : So move
2 : I was thinking maybe if you save the Crimson
2 : that would at least allow me
3 : right
2 : to to
3 : ok I mean there's no harm in
2 : (--) it down. Yeah, yeah
3 : cause there's nothing around Ok
2 : Yeah ok so
3 : So I'm good and then three
2 : Well there we go ok that was a good draw
2 : Very good draw
3 : One
3 : Two, three so Crimson goes back
2 : Alright
1 : Nice try
3 : Oh
2 : So is Temple of the Moon, ok well hey at last we

1 : Do I have to move right now? Let's see
1 : If I've only got this um
1 : Huh
1 : What have we got in the way of the Chalice? Nothing? But you have one and I have one
2 : I have one over here.
1 : yeah
2 : I mean I could
2 : Ah I was gonna say
1 : I I can give you this
1 : as one of my moves and then you can
3 : Yeah
2 : If you, if you can make it up to the Temple of the Moon which
2 : It's gonna be
3 : yeah
2 : Yes I don't think it's possible
1 : Not right now no
2 : Um

1 : Mm
2 : But
2 : But
2 : Let's try
2 : let's try to get the Pilot
2 : Um
1 : To
3 : I can, I can well I think she should just go here because you can
1 : Fly me there
3 : I can fly both and give her two
3 : And that would be three.
2 : Ok yeah and then I'd give her a fourth one.
3 : Yeah cause you have that power right?
2 : Right
1 : Ok
3 : Ok so next turn you give that?
2 : Yeah I I, yeah I can do anywhere on the island, awesome
1 : Yeah ok so then I will move to here
3 : And be done?
1 : And that's done. I don't have to move further if I don't want to. Ok these
3 : No
2 : No, no
1 : Ok chalices, I have three chalices now.
2 : Well that
1 : that's pretty cool and then three of these right?
2 : There you go
2 : um
2 : Yeah
1 : One, two, three
1 : Silver Gate, where's Silver?
2 : Right here.
1 : Ok um
1 : so swampy
1 : Lost Lagoon is really lost.
2 : That's fine
1 : Um and Copper Gate is soggy.
2 : That's ok
1 : That's ok too. We're not so bad.
3 : Well we can't isolate so
1 : Ok
1 : These go here.
1 : Ok so that's mine.
1 : That's my moves.
2 : Ok
2 : I'm going to
2 : shore up the Temple of the Moon
1 : Going to good idea.
2 : I'm going to shore up
3 : You want to give her?
2 : Oh also I'm gonna give you the
3 : Your
3 : Well which one do we want to do first because we can
1 : either way I can give you this or you can
3 : we can target this
2 : Ok um I'll give you
3 : um let's do this first cause she'r right on it.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Or (--)
3 : And then your next turn we can move her here and she can get all those
2 : ok, ok so I'm going to give you this card
1 : Ok good yeah
1 : Ok
2 : And you have to discard
1 : I have to discard something
2 : Ah discard
1 : That's a hard choice
3 : I'd I'd say that
2 : That's a tough call
3 : Earth
2 : Yeah discard the Earth because it at least leaves one of us with
1 : Yeah ok
2 : over over half of
3 : And I'm sure you'll get another one
2 : Yeah hopefully
1 : Mm
2 : Ok so I have
3 : Ok
1 : So that
1 : Mm
2 : she was left?
2 : (--)
3 : (--)
1 : No
3 : I think so, yeah one action per card.
2 : Um
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : Ok so
3 : We need to shore up something over here
2 : Oh yeah yeah I'll shore up
2 : Or
2 : Why don't I move here
2 : and shore up the Copper Gate
3 : Sounds good.
2 : Alright
2 : and that was that was three actions right?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Treasure, treasure, treasure, treasure says
2 : Ok I have
2 : Statue of Wind
2 : Chalice of the Ocean
2 : Ah which one's that, the discard one and I will discard the
2 : Statue of Wind
1 : Alright
2 : Ok
2 : So now it's
1 : (--)
2 : I'm gonna see what I'm gonna drown
2 : It's probably going to be
1 : You need three though
2 : Ok Coral Palace
1 : Mm
2 : The Bronze Gate
2 : is ok
2 : Dunes of Deception
3 : Ok
2 : And the good draw
1 : Mm
2 : Ok those all go here
2 : Um
3 : So
2 : Water's Rise
2 : or no that wasn't Waters was it?
2 : then
2 : Ok
3 : So
3 : Mm I should move
1 : Mmhmm
3 : I can move anywhere so how about I just move over
3 : here
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok good
3 : give you
3 : So that
3 : these would be my three because one turn, two three
1 : Ok great
2 : Well there we go, there we go
1 : So now all we have this?
3 : Yup
2 : Yup and we can put this
1 : take this off the board and do I give this away or I don't?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Well
2 : or
3 : Yeah let me do this first and then
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok and then
3 : three we might be losing something
3 : Only have five
1 : five cards in my hand oh right I have to get rid of something duh so we'll just get rid of these?
2 : Ah
2 : Give her the chalice yeah cause we still have there's
1 : Mm
1 : We still have a couple we have
3 : well that's six cards you still have to get rid of two
1 : Oh
2 : (--) another chalice yeah we
1 : another chalices we have several chalices ok
2 : we have
3 : Yeah
2 : there's four on the table
1 : and now we have this, so this is good.
3 : Ok so I did two. so now we need three
2 : Yeah so you can
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
3 : Misty Marsh
1 : Mm
3 : Ah Tidal Palace and
3 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Ok
2 : Alright
3 : So go ahead
1 : Ok ah
2 : Alright you can
3 : Mm
2 : You can I think take the Statue of Wind with your four cards
1 : I (--) yeah so take these
3 : We have two
2 : Awesome
1 : Ok where do these go? Over here.
2 : The discard pile
3 : Mmhmm
1 : ALright ok so we have two of these
2 : Um
3 : So that's one turn
1 : Ok so that's one turn, now I have
3 : And should you give me your
1 : I can give you my chalice
3 : Because I can fly anywhere
1 : Yeah it's good
2 : I, I can give you
2 : two of these at some point in the future
1 : So
3 : We need to shore up one of these
2 : Oh yeah that would be that too that'd be a good idea. I will I'll do that on my next turn
1 : Ok Oh I have, I can shore something up. I can shore up two as one turn.
3 : Ok
2 : Um I'm right up there.
3 : Does it have to be adjacent?
1 : Doesn't say
1 : adjacement, just says shore up two tiles for one action.
1 : Huh
2 : Mm
2 : Um
1 : move, hmm
1 : I don't know does it have to be?
1 : ah adjacent?
3 : Um I don't know.
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
2 : I don't think it says in the rules, just
1 : no I don't see anything, it just says two tiles per action.
2 : Just
2 : just two per action
1 : Ok
1 : So I can do that I
2 : or
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Flip an island from flooded back to normal.
3 : If you're adjacent to it, so yeah you do have to be
2 : Adjacent oh yeah, yeah it still counts
1 : What I still can
2 : You have to be, you have to be next to it yeah
1 : Adjacent, oh I can't
3 : So you can move toward one if you want
2 : I mean yeah you could do
1 : Ok
2 : Do, do maybe Coral Palace cause
1 : yeah
2 : I can I'll when it's my turn, I'll take the Tidal Palace
1 : Ok fine
3 : So do you want her to move toward it or
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah but I can't go diagonally
2 : Well
3 : So you just want to go here
1 : SO just go this way yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Um
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so that's one move
1 : Now
2 : I think,I think you have one left, I mean you could
1 : I have one left
2 : Actually how about
2 : Um
2 : I'll let you go here and then when it's your turn again
2 : hopefully, hopefully we don't lose
1 : lose the other that's a good idea, let's just do that
2 : these two
2 : Yeah even if we lose that one, that's fine but
3 : good
1 : Mmhmm yeah fine ok
3 : Ok
2 : don't want to lose that one
2 : Awesome ok so
3 : So let's hope that
1 : Awesome
1 : now
3 : this isn't
1 : take two of these
2 : Treasure cards
2 : this could be Water's Rise, did the water's rise?
1 : Helicopter Lift, ok
1 : One or pawns on the same tile to any other tile and Water Rises of course.
3 : Ok
2 : I bet well still, there's still
1 : I mean we're still on three, so it's not that terrible yet
2 : It's still three, it's alright, it's alright.
1 : Ok so this goes
1 : There
2 : Yeah that goes over here.
3 : Over here
1 : Mm
1 : Just take the top three off here
3 : Oh you gotta shuffle put it down and then you take
1 : Shuffle these first, ok fine.
2 : Yeah shuffle
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
1 : Mm
3 : I can't remember what was in there
1 : No
2 : Every, everything is in there more or less.
2 : Just hopefully not the important ones ok
1 : Right everything was in there.
2 : Oh wait
3 : Ok
3 : Does he still take
1 : two, three
2 : and we need one, two
3 : Three
2 : Come on, Come on, Come on, Come on
1 : Ok ah Silver Gate
2 : It's alright
1 : Silver Gate, ok we don't need that one
1 : Copper Gate
1 : That's just under water
2 : (--)
1 : or soggy that's ok
2 : It's alright.
1 : Crimson Forest
2 : That's gone doesn't matter
1 : Where's oh it's gone that's alright fine.
2 : Alright
1 : Ok that's cool
2 : Alright let's go let's
1 : wing
2 : (--) gets some land under me. I'll shore up this one.
2 : And we'll
2 : Move to this or I will shore up this
3 : What did we say that we were going to do for
2 : Um
3 : (--) this
2 : like ok for my third action
2 : I will
2 : give
2 : to anyone to give Treasure card
2 : that I can give to a player anywhere on the island
2 : for one action per card
2 : Oh wait. Oh I only have
1 : Mm
2 : I mean I could
3 : So you have three
2 : Do, do we
2 : Do we take a chance and
2 : possibly like
2 : sink that Copper Gate
2 : or, or take back the second action
2 : and then
2 : I give you these two cards
2 : but then take a risk of Copper Gate being flooded again, I don't think that's a good idea.
3 : I can unflood it well
2 : Ah that's risky
3 : It's up to you
2 : Ok well
1 : Well
2 : Um
2 : Third action I will give
1 : Mm
3 : Cause you can't
2 : You a
3 : Do either of these until my turn so
1 : Mm
3 : We have to take a risk no matter what.
2 : Shoot
2 : Ok well
2 : I will give you
1 : Hmm
2 : this as my
2 : third action.
3 : I think you should undo that and give me two cause then
2 : or
3 : Well not it doesn't matter, no that's fine
2 : I think I can only give
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah we we're also running low on time suddenly so we
2 : well ah one card per action
3 : Ok so go ahead
2 : Yeah
1 : Want to make our decisions and go yeah.
2 : out there
2 : Alright
2 : so
2 : Oop
2 : Chalice and gotta drop one. Drop the
2 : Statue of Wind, ok we have three, one, two

3 : Oh, this is over here
1 : Mm
1 : Ok, so I'm going here
2 : Alright
2 : (--) go there
3 : I would just draw, I think we do need it.
1 : Um
2 : Um
1 : Yeah, I don't have to do anything else I can just draw cards. Let's do that.
2 : Um
2 : Ok
2 : Do you maybe wanna
2 : use the, use your, use your last two moves just to shore up those two
3 : Might as well
1 : Might as well, just around us, yeah.
2 : Might as well, ok
2 : Can't hurt, can't hurt
3 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Cause it'll- Yeah, I don't wanna be stuck on an island part.
1 : Why not?
1 : (--)
2 : Yup
1 : (--)
1 : Helicopter Lift, we're outta here
2 : Awesome
1 : Great
1 : Uh
1 : we will be outta here
2 : Are there-
1 : We're done? Are we done now because we've
2 : I'm not sure
1 : Yeah, we're cool we got the- We've got three treasures and a
3 : Yay, good job
1 : we're outta here. Ok people
2 : Still a bit salty I couldn't get my
1 : If we played it again we might know what we were doing, you know
3 : I know, I forgot, I thoguht we needed all four and then I was like wait we only need three.
2 : earth stone
2 : I was, I, I
2 : Alright, we, we could've pulled off all four
3 : We were going for it
2 : We would not have pulled off all four, the island would've been
1 : Yeah

1 : Oh when we start flipping cards, we wanna make sure these ones don't sink
4 : Yeah
1 : and Fool's Landing
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
1 : So I'll go first
3 : Yup
2 : Mmhmm
1 : (Um)
2 : Let's see all the cards everyone has
1 : Ok
1 : There's no really (give these parts) so I'll keep them
1 : So first turn
3 : You are red, correct?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
1 : Yes
1 : I'm trying to think if I'll move first and flip or flip and then move
3 : Is your special ability
4 : You could flip, move, and then flip again and get all four of them
1 : I can flip two
3 : Yeah
1 : That's
1 : Ok
1 : So
1 : No I can only
1 : Can I do my special ability more than once?
3 : I think it should say it on your card, mine does.
4 : I'm pretty sure you can
1 : Yeah, that's once action, you're right. So that is one action, so I skip over
1 : And I can flip these two
3 : Cool
2 : So that's two actions
1 : Ok
1 : Is that two actions?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah, each of those is an action
2 : Actually, no you moved so that's also three actions
4 : That'd be three right?
3 : Oh right right right
1 : Yeah, one, two, three. Ok so three actions
1 : Then I need two
1 : May I have two cards please?
2 : Of course
1 : Frick
1 : Why don't we shuffle it- or shuffle these first
1 : Ok so the first thing we need to do is that, right?
2 : So um ten of
1 : And then discard that
1 : Rip it up so we can get back into play
1 : Ok and then and then
1 : There is nothing I can do with this so I gotta take
3 : Yeah you sh-
1 : Wait
1 : Should these have been like this?
2 : Yeah they already started like that
3 : Yeah, they just started like that
1 : Oh ok ok um
3 : I'd just finished the Water Rise card
1 : Yeah, I already did that- didn't I already do that?
3 : We have to uh put those back on, don't we?
2 : So you
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, so shuffle them
1 : Oh
1 : Thank you
2 : Then put them back up here
3 : Yup
1 : And then
3 : And then now you pick the two
1 : Two
1 : Ok, those two
3 : What are they called?
1 : Uh the Lost Lagoon and ss Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Again?
1 : What? Didn't we just do that?
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, at least they're not gone
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok, is there anything else we need to do?
3 : Uh I think that finishes your turn
1 : Ok
1 : Messenger
2 : Mmhmm
2 : So
2 : Um
1 : What's your ability?
2 : I can give cards to anyone
3 : Ok
1 : Do you want to give
2 : At any time
1 : Oh, I'm sorry
4 : That was right
2 : I could
1 : Given mine
2 : Do you want, Ok
1 : Give me the
4 : Ok yeah
1 : Fire
2 : Sure
1 : Ooo
1 : Who's near the fire?
1 : Ok I'm near the fire yeah
2 : Yeah cause you're right
1 : give me the fire
2 : Can't pick it up.
2 : Here you go
2 : So then I can do one more thing. Is there any point in me moving?
1 : Where are you at?
2 : I'm right here
3 : Um
1 : I see.
1 : How many moves did you do yet?
2 : That's two.
3 : Two
1 : You already did two moves?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : What was your first move?
4 : Giving two cards.
3 : She gave a card to you
2 : Yeah one card, one card
1 : Isn't that her-
1 : is that your
4 : That still counts as a
3 : Nah, it's just the uh the card
3 : for her
3 : role.
4 : She can- her thing is that she can give it to anybody, the rest of us, we have to be in the same spot.
3 : She gave you a card, and she gave
1 : Oh ok
2 : Mmhmm
1 : I would
1 : definitely get yourself centered
1 : well, I would think
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah, that makes sense
2 : Anyone disagree with that?
3 : Yeah
4 : (no)
2 : Alright
1 : Cause then at some point in time we could flip that card- Although?
4 : Although-
1 : Go ahead
4 : It doesn't matter, never mind
1 : But you used all three of your turns?
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : It's uh two treasure cards
2 : Then I take two of these
1 : Who's near those cuppy things?
4 : Here and there
1 : Ok
2 : Alright, Gold Gate and Temple of the Moon
2 : (Is) Gold Gate um
3 : Temple of the Moon
3 : (--)
1 : There's no way we could've saved that
2 : Sadness
3 : (Awesome)
1 : I'm sorry what's the other one?
4 : Temple
2 : Uh Temple of the Moon. This one.
2 : (Ok)
2 : Can I discard these?
2 : Actually
2 : the Gold Gate was the one that sunk?
3 : Yeah, so that goes here
1 : Ok
1 : so are you done with your three turns?
3 : (--)
2 : Yeah
1 : Did you do that (split this)
2 : So
3 : Yeah, she got those two
2 : Mmhmm
1 : So we don't have to do this cause there was no flood card right?
2 : Nope
3 : (--)
3 : Cool, it's my turn?
1 : (--)
3 : I guess I can give you this?
3 : Or
3 : (Oh wait)
1 : Oh wait, who's
4 : I just-
3 : Or maybe
4 : we're not in the same spot
1 : Yeah, maybe he should start giving you this, because you're close by, actually, on his turn
3 : Yeah
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : Ok, so I'll keep this
3 : (Are we in?)
1 : Ok
3 : I can
3 : I can unflood
3 : some of the cards
1 : D don't you have to be adjacent though?
3 : I'm allowed to- well on one of my turns, I can just move wherever
3 : that's my power, I can- so I can just use one to move wherever
1 : Oh
3 : and then unflood it-
3 : er shore it up
2 : Yeah
2 : So Pilot, you're blue
3 : (Uh hum)
1 : Can- you can't move diagonal though right?
3 : No
1 : Ok
3 : I mean I guess technically I can cause I can move to any tile for one turn
3 : I don't think it's worth shoring up
3 : these three
3 : because they're already discarded
3 : and unless there's a Water Rise card,
3 : they're not going to be-
3 : they're not going to sink anytime soon
1 : What's already discarded?
3 : These three. We just, we just sunk- where we ju- yeah sink? sunk? We sunk these
1 : So those cards aren't in play anymore?
3 : Not until there is another Water Rise card
1 : Yeah but do we want to risk it
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, probably not
1 : But then again, I can take care of these because I'm here
3 : Yeah, so is- should I
3 : uh
1 : Fly over there and then
3 : yeah
4 : I just don't know if is that really-
3 : (Should I just get another)
4 : Do we need to save that?
1 : I think if we have no better move, then go ahead and just-
1 : save em
3 : Yeah
2 : I would prioritize (those the ones) with the uh treasures on them first
4 : Yeah
1 : But that's what I'm saying. I can take care of these when my turn comes around. Oh.
4 : But both of us still have to draw those cards and if we get another Water Rise card, then one of those could get sunk.
1 : That's right
3 : Ok, you're right, You're right
1 : Ok
3 : So should I, um
3 : shore up the Templeof the Moon
1 : Definitely
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So I'll just move uh here I guess?
2 : Wherever you want
3 : Yeah (--)
4 : Yeah
4 : and just shore up the (--)
1 : Ok so
1 : You've only done one
3 : Uh yeah I
3 : that's one and then two
1 : Yeah
3 : so I might as well shore this right?
4 : Yeah
3 : (--)
1 : Ooo
3 : Ok
1 : Do you have any turns left?
3 : Uh no
2 : Yeah that was three
4 : (--)
1 : Ok
3 : (--)
2 : So
3 : Ok
2 : You got (a lotta Helicopter card)
3 : And now two Water Rise cards
3 : It's uh Breaker's Bridge, Phantom Rock
3 : Oh, there goes Phantom Rock
3 : Uh um
1 : That could have easily been any other card
3 : I feel like everything that could go wrong is.
3 : Breaker's Bridge where is that?
4 : It's this one.
3 : Ok
1 : Oh I can take care of those on my turn.
3 : Cool
3 : Over there, thank you.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Did the Water
1 : No, Water didn't rise.
4 : We just- Yeah
3 : Yeah we're good, we're in the clear.
1 : Ok
2 : Not yet
4 : Ok so my turn now.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Um
4 : What do you guys think?
1 : So what's your special ability?
4 : I can move diagonally, like I can shore this one up right now.
4 : (--)
3 : Yeah
4 : I could get both of those really
4 : if we wanted to. Or
3 : Well you should give me
4 : I can
1 : Well I- My next turn I can easily flip those so if you have something else to do, I don't know. Do we need to give- Oh you need to give your card to him.
4 : Yeah
3 : You should give me that.
4 : Ok
1 : Why don't you give me that?
4 : Where
3 : I think
1 : Oh
3 : Ye- I can, on my turn
1 : Ok
2 : Only thing- other thing you have to watch out for is you've got two treasures but you can only have five cards at a time.
1 : Right, right, right.
2 : And you're gonna eventually need to collect four of each one.
1 : Oo
4 : Yeah you're next turn you're gonna have to discard something.
1 : Oh we have to
2 : Or just like give it to someone else.
1 : pass these, yeah.
3 : Or her actions can be to get rid of- to pass them on to some of us.
4 : You could give- Yeah
1 : Yeah we're definitely going to
4 : Ok
3 : So you can just give
1 : So in other words everybody has to sa- sa- s-
1 : save something.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Sh-
2 : Ideally
1 : I should've gave you these.
4 : It's alright.
2 : It's ok
4 : We're still, we're still ok
1 : Ok well at least we got a plan
2 : Live and learn.
1 : Cause if you give him that
1 : No wait
4 : Yeah
3 : Then I've got five.
1 : No, oh no, if you give em to him
2 : Mmhmm
1 : and then
1 : (dumb) how do I get that card back to me
1 : and these over to you?
3 : On your turn, you can pass those on.
2 : Yeah
1 : And then you can give that to me.
3 : On my next turn, yeah.
1 : Ok
1 : ok so anyways, what're we gonna do now?
4 : Alright so
4 : I wanna give this to him (--)
3 : Uh huh
1 : Yeah
4 : So I can move- I mean I can take two turns and move to him
2 : So that's one.
4 : because I can move diagonally.
1 : Ok
4 : And then I could
3 : Would that- Wouldn't that
3 : Oh wait, just move?
4 : Well if that's, if that's what we're trying to do I can take
4 : two moves to get to you and then one to give you the card.
3 : Oh right I forgot I rea- Yeah, yeah
1 : Oh you have to be
1 : beside each other to give the card?
4 : Yeah everyone- The Messenger can pass them to anybody yeah
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Except for me.
1 : I forgot about that, except for you
3 : Yeah that's a- I didn't think of that.
2 : I'm special.
1 : Boy am I glad you guys know the rules.
4 : So if we need to like save like
1 : Ok
4 : like we might wanna
4 : have you give
1 : I'm gonna give the fire to her
4 : a card to her
1 : Yeah
4 : You- All you really need is just one.
4 : Just give one to her so that you don't have to discard a card
1 : Right
2 : Yeah
1 : Right
4 : on your next turn and then she can give it right back to you if we need to.
1 : Nah, cause I'm gonna start saving these. So anyways, go do your thing.
4 : Alright, so that's what we're doing?
3 : Yup
1 : Yup
4 : Alright (two move)
3 : that's two.
4 : Pass
3 : Three
4 : and then I draw two of those
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Don't flood
1 : Oo
2 : Then two of these
4 : And two of these
1 : What you (--) on, yeah oo
4 : Iron Gate and Whispering Garden.
3 : Iron Gate
4 : Whispering Garden's this one
3 : Ok
1 : Ok and there was no flood cards.
1 : Right?
4 : Right
1 : Ok
1 : so
1 : for the-
1 : my free turn, and it doesn't count as anything right?
1 : My special ability doesn't count?
3 : Uh no it should.
4 : I think- It still counts as a turn, just you can
3 : It counts as an action.
4 : You can save- Yeah it still counts as an action, but you can save two.
2 : Yeah
1 : Oh it does
2 : but you can do two at a time.
1 : Ok
1 : so do I definitely wanna do these then?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : uh
1 : Oh
1 : wait.
4 : I think so
4 : but
1 : But
1 : cause we got him
2 : Hmm
1 : But if these-
1 : yeah we need to do that first.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : So that's one action
3 : Mmhmm
1 : How many cards can I pass over?
3 : You could pass on
2 : One per action.
4 : One per action, but you're gonna have to move- You're gonna have to take a turn to move.
3 : Yeah
1 : Where do I need to move to?
4 : Well really you can only
4 : the only
4 : thing you can do is to move to us to pass, cause you can't move diagonally.
1 : Oh that's right.
3 : So you
3 : you can move-
3 : Oh.
3 : You should move there and give him one.
1 : Move
4 : Yeah, you can move here and give me
4 : something.
3 : I would
3 : Um
1 : Oh
1 : do I have to pick- Cause I always have to pick up cards from it right?
4 : Yeah you're gonna have to take two.
4 : I mean
4 : discarding treasure cards I don't think is the worst thing in the world cause I think there's a lot of them.
2 : Yeah, that's true.
3 : Yeah for sure.
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : so I have to move to be able to pass a card.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : But do I need to pass a card?
1 : I don't have anything else to do anyways though.
4 : Yeah
1 : So does that my third move?
3 : That's your second move.
4 : That's your second move and then you can pass for your third move.
1 : That's my second move.
1 : Um
3 : So you should probably just pass one of these to him.
3 : Cause I- If I can't take anything
2 : Yeah
1 : But he's doing the lions
1 : so I need to
1 : Well let me give that to you.
3 : N- No you can't, that's why. Yeah
1 : Oh I can't?
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : tell me what to do.
3 : I would give- I would, I would still give one of these to him
3 : and then somehow, I'm not exactly sure how yet, we'll get the
3 : uh I forget what this was called, but these ones
1 : Ok so we're gonna get- You're gonna start collecting these?
3 : to her.
1 : Oh and we're gonna give the lions to her?
3 : Hopefully.
3 : Uh it might take a while.
1 : No I-
1 : Here
1 : give me that.
1 : Um I have one turn left, right?
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : I mean you don't have, you don't have to use it but
1 : Cause I'm thinking on her turn
1 : Her turn, I know- her turn she can give it over there
2 : Mmhmm
1 : and that'll give you five. But at least you'll have a set, cause if I give you something you're not gonna have a set.
4 : True
1 : (--)
1 : Please, if you don't agree with this.
3 : No, no, no, I mean
4 : No that makes more sense- I think if, if we can give, if we can get somebody three, then like that should their one that they're going after.
1 : Ok
1 : You know what
3 : Right
1 : I didn't even need to move that- Wait
1 : wait
1 : let's back up.
1 : So this was a turn to bring me over there right?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So instead of me moving over here
2 : Mmhmm
1 : um if I take one
4 : Honestly you could just stay there
4 : and just not- and just
1 : You know what, I'm gonna move here
4 : because on my next turn I can give you
4 : this cup
4 : and then you'll have three.
1 : Where are these green cuppies at?
1 : There's one, where's the other green cuppy?
4 : Over there
2 : There
1 : Yeah, ok I am gonna take that turn there and then do I have one more turn?
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : but I would-
4 : I'd just stay where you are
4 : because that way
1 : Well the only reason why I was gonna move over there is cause if I need to flip two cards I can flip these two which are important to us.
1 : Or that one which is important.
3 : Right
4 : That's true.
3 : I can always fly someone too, we should keep that in mind, which doesn't count as an action.
1 : Right
4 : I think it's good to be on the same spot.
4 : So like with the three of us there I feel
4 : Just because we can pass easily between the three of us now.
1 : Oh
3 : Yeah we could
1 : but then it will take me two turns to get there where form here it will only take me one.
3 : Well no but I can still move you
3 : when it comes around to my turn.
1 : Oh that's right.
1 : Ok
3 : Or maybe you'll even get one now, who knows
1 : I still wanna move.
3 : But
4 : I don't know.
1 : I still wanna move
1 : God, yeah sorry
4 : It's up to you, it's your piece.
4 : Go ahead, aight that's fine.
1 : Ok, I'm done. Nope, I need those two.
3 : Yeah
4 : Now you gotta draw two.
2 : Oh you gotta get rid of one though.
1 : No
1 : not yet.
3 : She can pick, I think.
1 : Yes
4 : So you don't have to discard now.
1 : Yeah, but I'd rather
4 : We just move it up, yeah.
1 : Ok
1 : and then
1 : this I can't do and then
1 : I need to take three of these?
1 : Seriously
3 : Well we have to- Well no we have to reshuffle those.
4 : We have to reshuffle, yeah
1 : Oh that's right
1 : Oh
1 : (piss).
3 : Which means
4 : This is gonna be really hard
1 : Well no as long as we're keeping track of the rules which
4 : Yeah, just the flooding is gonna be hard to
1 : Ok the Iron Gate,
2 : Good bye
1 : The Whispering Garden,
2 : Oh
4 : (--) another one.
3 : Yeah, makes sense. So we need those two cards
1 : And then the Lost Lagoon, oh
4 : The Lost Lagoon's right in front of you.
1 : Somebody's keeping track of which cards are out of play, right?
1 : Ok
1 : your turn
4 : Alright
1 : Messenger.
2 : Ok so do we (--) decide I'm giving this to you?
1 : Definitely.
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
2 : So you're gonna eventually need to get your way down here.
4 : Yeah
1 : Or where's the other one?
2 : Um
3 : I can always fly- No we just lost that one.
1 : Yeah
3 : But I can fly you anytime any turn, so that's not a big deal.
1 : I told you
1 : to pay attention to that son of a bitch.
1 : Sorry
3 : Uh
4 : You could
1 : Aw she could've sand bagged anytime.
1 : Forgot about that.
3 : Yeah, yeah we should keep these in mind.
1 : Ok where are you at? You're here.
3 : Uh
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Um
1 : and you're not collecting anything. We gotta get you collecting something.
2 : Do you want me to move closer to you guys so it's a little easier? Which card would be easiest?
1 : Probably.
3 : Hmm
1 : that way you're kinda centered.
2 : So that was
2 : one
2 : and then
3 : Oh you uh ok
2 : like there
3 : So that's your second?
2 : Yeah I can move one more if I need to but if not
4 : I'd- yeah I'd maybe just stay there.
3 : She could always move to
3 : this one
2 : Temple of the Moon
3 : That way
3 : if need be, she'll be on it, or she can move to us if she has to.
1 : Yeah but you're gonna collect them so it's irrelevant for her to be there.
4 : I just thought
3 : But if she needs
3 : (--)
4 : to shore it up.
1 : Oh I see
4 : Cause the cards that are on top are like
1 : Ok
4 : this one, this one
1 : Right
4 : I don't know, I know there's a big
4 : cluster of them right in there.
3 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Right
4 : So yeah
1 : (--)
1 : So one,
1 : two
3 : That was your third
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok and you can't flip anything cause you can't flip diagonal.
3 : So
2 : K so
2 : two of these
2 : Alright
1 : (--)
2 : and one, two,
1 : Ok
1 : so I'm gonna collect the cups you're gonna collect the
2 : three
2 : Ok keep in mind, now I have two sandbags so we can make use of that
1 : How many of these do you need?
4 : Just four so we can get that one now.
1 : Don't sink anything.
4 : Yeah
1 : Cause you need to start working your way down there now.
2 : Alright
4 : Yeah well I can get there on my turn
1 : Hey- Oh that's right you can do the diagonal.
4 : and then she can
1 : One, two, ah
1 : Life is good.
4 : Alright which ones are they? The Bridge
1 : Who's turn is it?
2 : Alright so Breaker's Bridge, Cliffs of Abandon, which is this one
4 : That's where we are
1 : Damn it
1 : We've got to remember.
2 : Um
2 : and Temple of the Moon, which I'm standing on.
1 : What is it with these cards?
1 : It's always
4 : At least they're- at least, at least they're all close to each other. It makes our job easier.
1 : I feel like I have to stay there.
2 : Yeah
1 : I feel like I have to stay there.
2 : (--)
2 : I'm gonna-
2 : Should I use a sandbag and shore up this so that we don't have to worry about it going away?
3 : You could, or you could hold onto it.
4 : Um
2 : Should I hold onto it?
3 : Cause you
1 : Cause you can play em at any time right?
3 : Yeah so if- And like, technically, we might not see that again.
1 : Oh wait, no, no, no, no, no, no
2 : The only thing is if you draw a flood card
1 : Right, it's gone.
2 : and then
1 : Flip
4 : Yeah. Yeah.
2 : then it
2 : it goes away right away.
4 : That's probably smart.
2 : So I'll just do this now
3 : Oh so (--)
3 : they're repeats
3 : in that deck?
4 : For
1 : Ok so
2 : There should
1 : Is that, is that first turn?
2 : Hmm
4 : Which deck?
3 : In that
4 : The flood cards
3 : Yeah
4 : No, there's only one but
4 : the ones that we've drawn continue to add to the top so
1 : Yeah
4 : like those are the ones that are gonna get pulled up.
3 : Right
1 : But wait back up did you even take your three turns yet?
2 : Yeah I did.
4 : We're just worried about
1 : Oh ok
1 : that's fine.
2 : Give a card, and then I moved
3 : Yeah, yeah, getting a, getting a uh flood card, ok.
4 : Get it, yeah.
1 : Ok you moved, you took a flood card, did you take a third turn?
2 : Yeah I did.
3 : Yeah, she took all- You'll take your three turns first.
4 : Yeah she moved twice and gave one card.
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah so she took
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
3 : Cool so now it's
1 : So then you have to do that
2 : Yeah so I just did that
1 : Oh
1 : no
4 : So now it's, now it's his turn.
1 : Did you take- Did she take two of those cards?
3 : She yeah- She
4 : Yeah
3 : That's how she got another sandbag and she got the flood card.
2 : Mmhmm that's how I got
4 : That's when she got- Yeah, that's ok.
1 : Oh sorry.
1 : Thank you
3 : Um ok so it's my turn.
1 : Yes
3 : Um
3 : I
1 : Definitely shore up.
3 : Ok
1 : Oh wait or
2 : Or at least the one that you're standing on
1 : Yeah oh my god, yeah that's right, cause you'll die.
3 : Yeah
1 : Well no you can swim but
1 : Do you wanna flip them?
3 : Yeah
3 : I could um
1 : Actually you could do that and do two turns.
3 : I was- I can- You can shore up the adjacent also right, so I can just do those two.
4 : Yeah I can get that one.
3 : That'll be two turns.
1 : You're gonna give me him too
3 : Yeah that's what I was just thinking
1 : Ok
3 : and what
3 : You'll just get rid of one of those?
1 : Yeah I'll just get rid of the fire.
3 : Ok cool so that's what we'll do.
1 : So that's one move.
4 : But you guys aren't on the same space anymore.
3 : Oh you're right, you're right.
1 : Oh wait ok like back up.
3 : Uh
1 : So
3 : How bout this, I'll
3 : shore up
3 : Oh no that'll be (--)
1 : If you
1 : move over there-
1 : Yeah because then I can give you this back.
1 : So move over there,
1 : give me the card,
1 : and I have to throw one away.
3 : Oh
1 : Oh sorry
3 : You're good.
1 : And then
4 : And then just shore up one of these I guess
3 : Yeah
3 : You might as well just shore up the one you're on.
4 : Shore up uh- Yeah shore up that one. Cause that one
4 : will come up before
4 : the Cliffs
1 : Right
3 : Ok, so
3 : So now I have to get rid of a card
4 : Get rid of the lion
4 : Cause we don't- I already have three and the has one.
3 : Right
4 : Unless
3 : Well, I mean they're both kinda useless cause you're about to get another one
1 : What
4 : Yeah
3 : from her, but like this one I'm actually going after right now.
4 : Yeah
4 : I'd say the lion's more useless though.
3 : Yeah I'll get rid of the lion.
1 : Well
3 : (--)
4 : Cause she has, she has my fourth one.
1 : Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 : Ok
3 : Ok and then now I need three
1 : Mm
3 : of those please.
1 : Really?
3 : Yeah
1 : Did we have a flood card?
3 : We had two flood cards.
1 : No you
1 : Did you pick up a flood card? You only do that when you pick up a card right?
4 : Well we- Every, every turn we have to draw
3 : No, no, no we have to
4 : um
1 : Oh, yeah
4 : we have to draw those cards.
1 : Sucks.
2 : (--) yeah
1 : Oh that increases it
1 : ok.
1 : (--)
3 : Copper Gate,
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Temple of the Sun.
2 : Temple of the Sun
2 : That's Temple of the Moon.
3 : Oh whoops, misread it.
1 : Yeah, what's the third one we need to find?
3 : Uh we got Temple of the Moon- Sun, Crimson Forest
4 : Crimson Forest
3 : Copper Gate
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Thank you
3 : Cool, your turn.
4 : Ok
4 : Um
1 : Ok
1 : hang tight.
1 : I'm sorry
1 : I am so sorry, I- This is what I mean by I get bossy so just
4 : No
4 : whatever- What were you thinking?
1 : I don't know, that's why I was just saying wait before you move let me just think, but I'm sorry
4 : Ok
1 : it's your turn go ahead.
4 : that's fine.
4 : Um
3 : You should
3 : I don't know if the
4 : I mean is the plan I can- I use two moves to get down there?
3 : No
4 : No?
3 : because I can just move you.
3 : So it's a waste of an action.
1 : Oh that's right, so that's irrelevant.
4 : Ok
3 : I think you should give me that,
3 : the
3 : I don't remember the name, but that one you're holding,
4 : The yeah, uh, this one.
2 : Something of the earth.
3 : and then
4 : That makes sense
4 : I can give her
1 : Where are you at?
4 : (And I would)
1 : Where are you?
4 : I'm right here.
3 : Oh do these contrib-
4 : Oh wait, wait, or wait, hold on, I have to move first.
1 : Flip him
3 : Do these contribute to your five?
1 : No, you don't have to move.
4 : But I can't give him that until I'm on his space, but I can move
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Get rid of the fire.
3 : No wait, but I can just use this now.
1 : No
1 : you don't need to .
1 : Why?
3 : Cause doesn't
3 : he wanna get to there?
1 : Ok wait, back up
4 : Here give me this back.
1 : He needs- Yeah
1 : He needs to move
4 : I can move and give you guys these and then- but that's my, that's my turn though.
1 : Oh at the same time?
2 : But that's all three, yeah.
3 : That's three turns.
4 : That's my turn.
3 : Ok wait, wait, wait, you could do that.
1 : You don't need to do that
3 : That's your three turns, but then I'll just, I'll just move you
1 : Yeah
3 : here and then when it comes around to her, she can just give you this.
1 : Ah
4 : Yeah
4 : Ok
1 : Yay, ok.
4 : Alright so I'll move
1 : So I need to get rid of him
4 : and give you guys these.
3 : And now you are- Oh
1 : Oh yeah.
3 : Oops, sorry
1 : Oop
1 : and you flew him
3 : Yeah so he's green, he's gonna be
4 : What does this card say, cause I don't really remember it?
1 : He can fly him anywhere,
3 : Move anywhere
3 : um
1 : anytime.
3 : play it at anytime, does not count as an action.
4 : Do you have to go with- Do you guys have to go with me though?
2 : No
3 : No, just move someone.
4 : No, ok
1 : Ok
1 : so
1 : my turn now?
1 : No
1 : you gotta do those things.
3 : Yeah, now you get two of these.
4 : Yeah
3 : awesome.
2 : And you get three of these.
3 : Wait, he's gonna have to do the Water Rise card before he
2 : Aw
1 : Yeah you gotta shuffle those.
4 : It's still, it's still three, but yeah, you have to shuffle them.
1 : And you have to shuffle these back in
2 : Yes
1 : and then give him the three.
3 : Yeah
3 : but we still have to move it up one, right?
3 : Or is that
1 : No, cause we dind't- Did he get one?
4 : Yeah you still have to move it up one.
3 : Yeah, yeah, he got a- Yeah
1 : Oh, (--)
1 : Who played this game?
2 : Alright then he needs three.
2 : Yeah
4 : Hopefully nothing sinks.
1 : I'm getting antsy
4 : Uh Temple of the Sun's gone
2 : Oh
1 : Where's the other one at?
4 : Uh
2 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ah I told you flip that one.
1 : Ah
1 : Ah
4 : That's gone.
4 : And then Breaker's Bridge is flooded now.
1 : I am so taking my turn.
4 : Oh wait this goes in there.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Oh
4 : Now you're up.
3 : I know
3 : what I think you should do.
1 : Oo
3 : Or I have an idea.
1 : Please
3 : You should
3 : give me
3 : the fourth of this
1 : Definitely.
3 : And I'll get rid of my red
3 : and then I'll fly you
3 : here-
1 : Well actually
3 : Or you can move
3 : to- Right? Cause where are you?
1 : This is what I want- no, no, no
1 : This is what I wanna do and you tell me though-
1 : Oh wait
1 : So when you turn- When you get a treasure is that considered an action?
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Get- Yeah
1 : Ok so wait let me think.
4 : So if you give, move, get the treasure, that's your, that's your three.
3 : Where are you
3 : on
4 : She's right
4 : here, right?
3 : He's red?
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : What, what I'm trying to do is flip these.
3 : Oh ok
1 : So do I wanna move over, flip
4 : We definitely need to flip this one. I don't- This one's kind of useless cause
4 : we don't need it to get anywhere.
1 : Ok
1 : so that'd be ok so
3 : So that's one
1 : K so it's
3 : But technically we're still at this.
1 : That way could- So that's my second turn, that's yours.
3 : Ok
2 : And then you're gonna wanna
2 : move
4 : I wouldn't do that yet.
3 : I can always- If you wanna get the treasure immediately I can just move you with this and then you can claim the treasure.
4 : Oh
1 : Where is your cuppy thing at though?
1 : This
4 : The cup's
2 : It's right here. (--) only needs (--)
3 : I- It doesn't
4 : Oh
1 : No, no, no, that's mine, this is yours.
3 : But it's ok because I can move
4 : He can move wherever he wants.
3 : I can move anywhere, for one action.
2 : Yeah, cause that's his special power.
1 : Oh ok
4 : We can get, we can get all three,
3 : So I don't need- I never need this.
4 : we can get all three treasures this
4 : next
4 : round
1 : Ok so one,
1 : two,
3 : It would just be getting to Fool's Landing
4 : Yeah
1 : One, two, you'll move me
4 : And then we just have to hope we draw another one of those cause that's how we get off right?
2 : Yeah
3 : Well we all have to be on the same tile
3 : to- You like
3 : transfer all this at once.
4 : Yeah, but we need that card I think.
2 : Oh good point.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah to get off the island.
1 : I, I can't imagine there are only two in this game.
1 : Ok so is that it? I'll move- Or no, I'm
1 : flipping this, that's my second action
1 : my third
4 : Give him-
3 : Then I'm gonna
1 : You're gonna
4 : But you're- you passed him your card though. That was two right?
3 : move you
1 : Right
1 : this would be third.
3 : No, no, no, no, no, me moving you just, me moving you just happens
2 : No, no, no
1 : Oh wait
1 : that's right.
2 : It's just a thing
1 : You move me
3 : Third is you getting the treasure
1 : And then we get the
4 : Yeah
2 : And then discard those
2 : Awesome.
1 : And then I need two of those.
2 : Look what you got.
1 : Ah oo
4 : Nice, ok
2 : Alright and then you need three of these wonderful people.
1 : Yeah you (didn't have to) remmeber that rule.
1 : Ok the Forest, the Crimson Forest.
4 : The Crimson Forest is gone.
2 : Buh bye
1 : Ah it's ok, like you said we only had
4 : That's fine.
1 : Oh no, flip
1 : And then the Lost Lagoon.
1 : Like you said, irrelevant.
4 : Thank you
4 : That one goes with- back in there, yup.
3 : Ok
4 : So now
1 : Your turn
2 : Alright so as one of these I'll give you that.
4 : Messenger
1 : Yay
1 : Oh we could have remembered the sand bad thingy
2 : Um
4 : Mm
1 : That's your job, your job to remind us.
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
3 : You should
4 : You just
3 : probably flip
1 : Flip
3 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Yeah
2 : I guess then that makes two
3 : or shore.
2 : And then I'll move closer cause we eventually need to all be there.
1 : Yeah
1 : cause you're not getting any
2 : So that's three.
3 : Ok
1 : How many treasures do we need to get?
4 : Just three
3 : Three
2 : Three
1 : Ok so we got the cards
4 : Yeah
2 : (--)
1 : So we all kinda gotta hover back there eventually.
2 : K and then one, two
2 : three of these. The Copper Gate
2 : is gone.
2 : The Silver Gate
2 : is flooded. And Tidal Palace
2 : is also flooded.
1 : We don't care cause we got the little cuppy already.
4 : Alright
3 : Cool
3 : K so it's my turn.
3 : I'm gonna go
3 : to here using my special power
1 : Hey, and now does that count as an action?
3 : And then I
3 : That's one action.
3 : That's my second action, will be claim the treasure.
1 : Ok action
1 : Oo
3 : And then
3 : my third can just be to flip, yeah
1 : Oh no wait, no, no, no, no
2 : Oh no you
2 : um
3 : What?
1 : Well that's irrelevant but you- we wanna keep you near here
1 : because you did your (goal) now
4 : I just, yeah, I just moved back.
3 : Yeah ok
4 : I would just move back to there
1 : Yeah
4 : casue we don't need any,
4 : any of this.
1 : Oh you can't go diagonal this time.
3 : I can't
3 : Yeah I can't move
3 : Cool, so now
1 : Ok
3 : And then uh three
3 : of those.
4 : Three of those
1 : Oh
1 : I hate those cards.
3 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Here
3 : Cave of Shadows,
3 : and uh Dunes of Deception.
1 : Oh why can't it be my turn?
4 : Alright so my turn.
4 : I'm gonna take the treasure
4 : for one
1 : (--)
4 : um
1 : You can move diagonal, right?
4 : Yeah and then I'll just move to Fool's Landing I guess
4 : or
4 : should I (--), I should probably save this right?
1 : Yeah I would definitely save that one
4 : Ok so
3 : well
2 : So that's
3 : why?
1 : Because if we lose this
2 : But I also have a sandbag card
1 : when he pulls cards
1 : But you can't
3 : No she can use that now
4 : Oh ok
3 : Right? Cause that (--)
2 : I can use it whenever.
3 : You might as well just save it
2 : Ok
3 : now and save his action
1 : Yeah that's what I would say, so I would move that
4 : Well it really-
4 : I mean can everybody make it back this turn?
4 : We can win
3 : Yeah
3 : I mean I think
1 : You can't move diagonal, can you?
4 : Well I can, so I can get, I can get back right now
2 : He can, that's his special power.
3 : I would do that.
4 : You can get back next turn
1 : Uh ok
1 : but here's on thing I want you to consider.
1 : If for some god forsaken reason you pull these two cards
1 : you cannot get back.
1 : We need to save that land
1 : for traveling.
3 : Who can't get back?
1 : These guys.
3 : I can. I will be able to.
2 : Well I have a-
1 : Ok
2 : And then I have this, so I can save it.
1 : It's up to you, just letting you know.
4 : The only- My only question is can you use the sandbag out of turn?
3 : It should say right now, it should say
2 : Yeah
3 : play anytime.
2 : I mean it's a special action time, yeah
1 : But there's sometime you that you can't use it. I think when the flood
1 : card- Yeah it's the flood cards
3 : It says
4 : Well it's after- If it's already sunk you can't use it, but if you can use it right now, use it right now.
1 : Right
3 : It says play anytime.
2 : Alright, so let's do it.
4 : Alright
4 : yeah.
4 : And then I'll move back.
2 : Discard this
4 : And that'll be two and three.
3 : Cool.
4 : And then I have to take two of these
2 : I'll give you how many?
2 : Did you get a
4 : I didn't get one so three of those
2 : K
1 : Ah
4 : So Misty Marsh,
4 : Howling Garden,
1 : Oh wait
1 : One
4 : It's down there.
4 : and Cave of Embers.
1 : There.
2 : Ok

1 : I'm definitely gonna shore up
1 : these
1 : two for my first action
1 : Um any recommendations on what I should do next?
2 : Um
2 : You could move to this one and then shore up those two
1 : Yeah (--) so that's, that'd be the end of it.
2 : But tha-
3 : Yeah
2 : That'd be your second and then leave
1 : Two and
1 : Three
3 : yeah so that's all three
1 : ok
1 : Super
2 : and then you draw
2 : is it three or is it two?
1 : Mm yeah draw two treasure
3 : two
1 : Oh Water's Rise
1 : so it's still
1 : two
1 : and then shuffle the flood
1 : we don't have a flood discard pile do we? Ok
2 : Yeah we do
1 : And place it on top of the flood draw pile
1 : and then
1 : discard this card to the Treasure
1 : thank you
2 : Mmhmm
2 : and then you have to
3 : draw
3 : Flood cards equal to the water level
2 : Flood card
1 : So that's two and just these
2 : So just two
1 : See Golden Gate and Lost La
1 : goon

2 : Oh
1 : (--)
2 : you're right

2 : (--)
2 : Right cause I can't do anything else right now.
3 : (--)
1 : One two
2 : One two
3 : you can go, can you go diagonal or not?

3 : Alright
3 : So you guys (--)
2 : NnMm
1 : NnMm
2 : Alright
3 : Can you use a Helicopter Lift
2 : So I guess the only thing really to do is to try to save this one.
3 : Yeah
3 : So should I just
3 : Use Helicopter Lift?
3 : To go over there
1 : Or you could just move it yeah, just save it. I don't know how many are in the deck.
2 : You don't even have to use your Helicopter Lift
3 : So just ok so just go
1 : Just one move and then
3 : One
2 : You don't have to be on it you just have to be right here right?
3 : Two
1 : Yeah I- it could be adjacent
2 : Yeah so then one
3 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : Two
2 : And then
1 : Two of then
3 : Ok
3 : That's two and then
3 : that's it
1 : Yeah you could just hang out there.

3 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : (--)
2 : Oh right here
3 : Ok
1 : Ok so
3 : Alright
1 : Do we have to
1 : Ok so
1 : giving each other cards is one action right?
1 : Um but I guess I don't really
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : But you have to be on the same
2 : tile to give cards
1 : Ok
1 : We don't really have anything
2 : Yeah
1 : I guess I'll just shore up
1 : the one I'm on and the one beside us
3 : those ok
1 : Ok so I'm
1 : there
1 : I don't know if there's anything else worth
2 : Mm yeah
1 : doing
3 : You can
2 : Unless you want to
3 : move to hers and then give her one if you want
1 : Yeah
1 : that's one action that's
3 : give her the
1 : that yeah so it's three actions
3 : Oh that's mine
1 : Oh that's two, where's hers? Oh you're here.
2 : Oh wait but then you- to give a card would be in another action
3 : Yeah it is
3 : So yeah
2 : Oh ok I see what you're saying.
1 : So there's one two and then
3 : So one and then
1 : three right?
2 : Yeah

1 : and then draw
1 : two treasure deck
1 : cards
1 : Thank you

2 : Ok
1 : Ok and there
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah um
2 : I'll do this one now so I can use it before it goes bad
2 : i don't have to be on it to use this right?
3 : Sandbag
1 : Sandbag's can shore up any one tile before it sinks.
1 : It doesn't say on there.
2 : Ok so do you think we can just use it?
3 : Yeah
1 : Is it in the
1 : book at all?
2 : And it doesn't count as an action. So let's just do that.
3 : (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : No ok
2 : Alright and then
2 : Is there
2 : really anything else I should do?
2 : Cause I can't get all the way over there.
3 : Ah yeah
1 : Well I mean you're-you have two of the chalice and you're on the chalice you might as well just stay there.
3 : Can't give her any
2 : No I'm here
1 : Maybe you should get closer to the chalice? I don't know why I keep thinking
2 : Ok
1 : You're gray
2 : So I'll just go, one two
3 : One, two
2 : Oh I didn't use any of mine yet right?
3 : Now
1 : Yeah so just hang out on the
2 : So three
3 : Three
2 : Ok
1 : Chalice maybe we draw soon
2 : And
2 : I gotta do this one
3 : One two three four, you have to get rid of one.
3 : One of them
1 : (--)
2 : That's only oh six
3 : Cause you have one, two, three, of-yeah
2 : Does it count? Like you know how we have to use those right away? So does that count or no?
3 : Are we allowed to give?
3 : yeah
2 : or should I just get rid of one of these?
3 : I don't know can you get rid of Water's Rise?
1 : Which order did you draw them in? Does that make a difference?
2 : Oh I got Water's Rise first.
1 : Then I think it's o
3 : what does it say?
1 : k
3 : You may only have five cards in your hand including treasure, special
3 : It said you must immediately choose and discard the extra cards to the treasure.
3 : You may use the power of a special action card before you discard it.
3 : So um
3 : I guess yeah it's in order.
3 : Discard the extra cards
2 : So but
3 : You have to disc-
3 : which one did you pick first?
2 : I picked this one first so this one.
3 : Ok so yeah
2 : Ok and then we have to do this one so we can move that up a notch
1 : So it's at three
2 : Yeah
1 : Uh oh
2 : Re-shuffle these
2 : And then
2 : Discard the Water's Rise
2 : And then I still have to pick these and now it's three.
3 : Three
1 : Three
2 : Whispering Garden
2 : Iron Gate, we just lost Iron Gate
1 : Whispering Garden
1 : Uh oh
2 : And Cliffs of Abandon can you put that over there?
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Alright so I'll give her one
2 : You have to be, are you guys on the same one?
3 : Oh yeah we have to be on the sa- uh
2 : You can use your power though to fly there and then give it to her
3 : Yeah so I'll do that
2 : You don't even need to use your Helicopter Lift thought you have that special power.
3 : Oh yeah
1 : So you just
1 : Move to the gate
3 : And
1 : And then
3 : That's one
3 : two
1 : it's two
3 : I could of used the if I didn't want to use another power I mean use a
2 : yeah
3 : It depends actually cause what else can I do?
3 : If I use one, two,
1 : Can't you shore up something?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah so I guess I'll just
3 : Use that
1 : Well you're
3 : I mean use that as the first one.
3 : So I use one already
2 : Ok but then giving her is two.
3 : Giving her one
3 : Cause I use this to move
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : yeah
3 : And then this
1 : and then just sh-
2 : And does that not count as a
2 : Oh ok I see what you're saying
3 : Yeah
1 : (--)
3 : And this can be
3 : Two
1 : Well you don't even have to move, if you're beside it you can just shore it up
3 : Oh yeah ok
3 : two
3 : and should I shore this one up as well?
3 : I could move oh
1 : That's three I think right?
2 : Ah
3 : Two
2 : Well this doesn't count as an action.
1 : The moving, oh that doesn't count. Yeah then, might as well.
3 : Yeah
3 : So
2 : But then that would be a
3 : three
2 : that'd be four
1 : oh so just
3 : three
2 : right?
2 : Do you see what I'm saying? Wait cause that didn't count but ok
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh yeah yeah move one ok.
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
2 : And then you're on the treasure.
3 : Alright
1 : So many rules.
3 : So
3 : These two
3 : I don't have to use that yet anyway.
2 : Yeah no you don't have to
1 : No I'll just save them.
3 : Ok
3 : I have to take
3 : Three
3 : Can you pass me three?
1 : Yeah three, one, two, three
3 : thanks

1 : Ok so I need to get to one of the fire ones.
2 : Ok
3 : Oh yeah
1 : Where I'm here, where's, there's on and then then there's one
2 : Right here or there.
3 : Oh I should've probably
1 : Oh
3 : flew you there
1 : Let's see
2 : Oh I didn't even think of that
3 : yeah
2 : One, two, three
3 : I mean you can
1 : I can
2 : (--)
3 : When we come back to mine
1 : One
2 : Yeah you can wait till next turn and he can fly you there.
1 : Two
3 : I'll fly you there.
1 : Three
2 : And then right now you can just shore these up. Do you see what I'm saying?
1 : one
1 : So ok
1 : One and then
1 : two
1 : should I just move one closer just
1 : Yeah three
1 : Draw two treasure cards
1 : I have two treasure cards
1 : So do I
1 : I can dis-
1 : card any of these right?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok so we should probably
1 : which, which one should I discard?
3 : Oh
3 : Discard the
2 : the one
3 : The
3 : Yeah that
1 : the cup?
1 : and keep the rock
2 : Or do you think we should do the (--)?
3 : Cause I could give her that you could give her
2 : Should we
2 : discard the Lion cause that's what we have the least of.
1 : Yeah discard the Lion but I have to discard another one right?
3 : Yeah discard that
3 : Yeah I was gonna say
2 : Oh I didn't realize you had that many
1 : Should I discard the rock or the
1 : chalice?
3 : Chalice cause I have one of these so one, two, three, four, yeah
1 : Chalice
1 : So then we'll have four
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : And then three flood cards
1 : our poor island
1 : Copper Gate
1 : Crimson Forest and Howling Garden
1 : So Crimson Forest
2 : Crimson Forest
1 : Howling Garden
2 : Ok
1 : ok dokey
2 : Alright do I should I give anybody my- no
2 : Do I ahould I move somewhere?
2 : Should I just
1 : Yeah you could probably shore that one up.
3 : Yeah shore that up
2 : So that's one
2 : Oh wait I don't have to move right ok so that'd be.
3 : Yeah
2 : One
3 : and you can also move towards
1 : Yeah those three should probably-
3 : one of those and shore them
2 : Ok
2 : Two three, but I can't actually do it this turn right?
1 : Oh well, well you're closer to it, I guess that helps.
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh yeah
3 : Can
3 : you can't shore up diagonal?
1 : No, it has to be adjacent
2 : No
3 : Ok
2 : Oh no
2 : Ok but I get rid of this one cause we don't even need that many
1 : Yeah we only need the four fires.
2 : But I have to move this up
3 : Wait did you,how much did you
3 : did you pull this one last?
2 : Yeah but don't you have to take two every time?
3 : Ok
2 : right?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : No I mean don't you discard the last one you pulled?
2 : Oh really?
3 : Yeah
3 : That's how we did it last time
2 : Ok so we don't have to, are you sure we don't have to go through with it?
1 : I think we have to always do the waters.
3 : Yeah
1 : Rise
3 : Oh yeah well
1 : Yeah is it five before we take the action or after we take the action?
2 : You do not get a replacement card if you (--)
2 : I have no idea
2 : I don't know
1 : It does say you may use the
1 : power of a special action card before you discard it which makes it sound like
1 : that wouldn't
1 : count toward the five?
3 : I feel like um
3 : when you choose six
1 : Hmm
3 : first you must immediately take away one
3 : And then use the Water's Rise
3 : So like we take away
3 : the one we
2 : oh so still use the Water's Rise
3 : Yeah I say
3 : I say take away that one
2 : this one?
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Let's put it in this pile?
3 : yeah
2 : (--)
2 : Oh ok
1 : (--)
3 : Ah
2 : alright so we have to play this one.
2 : Alright
2 : So we move it up
2 : To re-shuffle
1 : (--) and see if it counts towards the five or not
3 : Yeah I think it does
1 : Six
3 : Yeah cause it's a special action
1 : Oh yeah if you ever have six or more you must immediately
3 : Yeah
1 : Choose
1 : to use one ok
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And now we're up to three still. Lost Lagoon
1 : Cool
1 : Lost Lagoon
2 : Copper Gate
1 : Copper Gate, Nnmhh
3 : So that's just gone
2 : And Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok
2 : Right there
2 : Ok and then it's your turn so remember we have to move here yeah
1 : Sweet
3 : Alright so I'll f-
3 : I'll fly you
1 : I need to go from here to
1 : to you and you are
3 : Yeah
2 : ok so that's one
1 : You don't need to be on the same one as me to fly me
3 : No
1 : Ok cool
3 : I could just fly you and then
3 : Oh yeah when it's your turn
1 : Mhmm
3 : I can give you this
2 : You have to be on the same thing as me.
3 : Us? ok
3 : So I'll fly over to you
3 : Oh that's you
3 : That's one
2 : Ok
3 : two
3 : and then
3 : my third one, I'll shore up
3 : This
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : And then do you want to
3 : two treasure
1 : two treasure cards
2 : Oh we're still on it
1 : I know it's only just to get a treasure
3 : Another Helicopter Lift
3 : Alright, ok
2 : And then
3 : Do we need a Helicopter Lift at all?
1 : I don't know, we should definitely save some
3 : Oh wait I can't do it now anyway
2 : right now
3 : can- oh yeah I can
2 : Oh because it doesn't count
2 : Um
3 : Oh and I could do a Sandbag
3 : Think I should just use a Sandbag?
1 : To like save the Treasure one maybe?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : And then Helicopter Lift
3 : Anybody need uh
1 : No but I just need to get the fire treasure
3 : I feel like I should move you though
2 : to here?
3 : To
2 : Ok
3 : To shore up one of these so I'll do that
2 : Sounds good
3 : Ok
3 : (--)
3 : And plus you have these three anyway for
2 : Yeah ok and then three of these
2 : let's hope it's not Temple of the Moon though
3 : Wow
2 : Is it Temple of the Moon?
1 : Uh oh
3 : Yup
1 : Uh oh gotta swim
3 : Our luck
2 : So I just have to
2 : Go to this one?
1 : Move
2 : Right?
1 : I wouldn't move to that one cause if that one sinks and you're dead, I would move to that one.
2 : Oh
2 : Ok
3 : Howling Garden
2 : Where is that one, ok
3 : And
3 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : uh Breaker's Bridge
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : So definitely
1 : capturing this treasure
1 : So discard these into the treasure
1 : card pile
1 : and I'm on that so
1 : What do we do with the treasure we've captured?
3 : I guess just leave it where ever
1 : just
1 : hang out there
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Ok so that was one
1 : cool
3 : that was one
1 : is one
3 : Oh you can give her one
1 : Yeah
3 : But then she'll have to discard
2 : but only if she's on the same
3 : Oh yeah
1 : where are you you're the
2 : All the way there
1 : gray
2 : Yeah so
3 : One, two
1 : Hmm
1 : Where is it? Yeah
3 : Oh you can only move two
2 : You might as well like try to
2 : save something
3 : yeah save, save two
1 : like that
2 : you can save up to two right?
1 : Um so
3 : save
3 : these two
2 : oh but you have to be
2 : I see
3 : you have to be
3 : adjacent
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok well then at least
3 : so that'd be one
3 : and
3 : that'd be two right?
1 : Mmhmm, like every one
3 : Ok
1 : But maybe we should
1 : save that one since it is
3 : uh
1 : one of the treasure cards
3 : so
3 : one and two
1 : yeah I don't know
3 : yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : two of these
1 : two of those oh cool
1 : and then
1 : three, we're at three still right?
2 : yeah
1 : Yeah, ok
1 : Cave of Embers
1 : Crimson Forest and Whispering Garden
2 : Where's Crimson Forest
2 : Is it Crimson Forest can I have that card cause that just sank.
1 : And Whispering uh oh
2 : Alright
3 : Do we still have, so we have that, that, that
3 : Oh so we already took that one out so it doesn't matter
1 : Ok
3 : We just need to worry about those
2 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm but if that one goes you won't have a way of getting to that
2 : Ok well I can give you
3 : Oh I can fly
2 : It's my turn right?
3 : Or
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Messenger
2 : Does it say how many I'm allowed to
2 : Give? It says it counts as one action, can I give her
2 : can I give you two cards in the same-
1 : I think so cause I discarded four in the same action.
3 : yeah
2 : Turn?
3 : So I'll be yeah that'll be two.
2 : I guess I can give you
2 : One
1 : Cool so we
2 : two
3 : Two
1 : have enough for that
1 : chalice
2 : and should I move or should I just
1 : now
3 : wait oh are you
3 : Do you have to be on the same one as her?
2 : I have that power though
3 : uh
3 : Oh ok alright
2 : Should I move or should I just stay where I am?
2 : I guess closer so I can try to shore that up.
1 : Yeah might as well
3 : Yeah and then
1 : This yeah
2 : Ok or actually I'm gonna move this way so that I can get to there
3 : That's three ok
2 : Ok

3 : Three
2 : Silver Gate
2 : and Coral Palace
1 : Mm
2 : any of those
2 : Oh Silver Gate
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so we didn't lose anything at least
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So
3 : so probably
1 : I'd try to shore up some stuff
2 : fly yeah fly somewhere and try this to get those
3 : Shore up
3 : So
1 : Once you're there you can just shore up that one and then that two
3 : Yeah so one
3 : two
1 : or you can move if you wanted
3 : and then just fly
2 : wait where were you?
1 : you can flip an island.
2 : Oh
2 : see you're- this is me, you're here
1 : Oh
3 : Oh yeah ok
1 : I don't know why I keep
2 : so you have to move
1 : the blue and gray
3 : I could sh-
3 : Shore up this
2 : Yeah as one
1 : Mmhmm
3 : You don't even
3 : shouldn't care about that at all, so
1 : Yeah since we already
1 : You might as well just move and then
2 : oh
3 : So
2 : So
2 : You can fly
3 : So
3 : move here
3 : and then do
2 : Yeah
1 : that and that
3 : One
3 : two is three
2 : Ok

1 : So
2 : So could you go like one?
1 : Ok yeah so
1 : One
2 : but then we couldn't cash in
1 : Two
2 : then you couldn't get your thing yet

2 : Oh yeah that's a good idea.
1 : Which how do I do it?
3 : bring her to here.
1 : Wasn't that the end of my
3 : You could still use a Helciopter to yeah
2 : that doesn't count as an action
1 : Oh ok so
3 : This one
1 : move to here
2 : Mm yeah
3 : Yeah
1 : and then just discard this over there
2 : Yeah
3 : But then she has to still wait until you give her that one
3 : for her to cash it in.
1 : Oh yeah
3 : I think we have to shore this up as well right?
2 : Yeah but right now she has that Water Rise, oh I already did that.

3 : As another move.
3 : Let me see if
2 : Cause
2 : Or should I use mine to try to get to Fool's Landing?
1 : Probably just get to Fool's Landing
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok so that was

1 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Coral Palace is gone.
1 : MmMm
2 : And Whispering Garden
1 : Whispering Garden

2 : So basically is your
2 : You're just trying to get to
1 : We're all just trying to get to Fool's Landing
2 : Fool's Landing
2 : You can fly yourself there.
3 : Ok so
3 : Yeah

2 : Yeah do you still have to take yeah, the two treasure?
2 : Or actually while you were, oh no it doesn't matter they sink I guess.

1 : Cause you could just swim anyway if it sank.
2 : Get two of these. Ok perfect so you have the Helicopter Lift
1 : Ok
3 : Oh you could fly over.
2 : Or should we wait cause I could just do that
2 : and then she could
2 : lift us all out.
3 : Oh ok
2 : Oh wait I see what you're saying though.
1 : Well don't we need a Helicopter to get off?
2 : yeah
3 : Ok yeah so just save it.

3 : three
3 : these would be on the pile.
3 : Those three
3 : That we shuffle
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Oh I think she can just move and then we could just
2 : move it and then I can fix it right?
3 : yeah
2 : Uh oh
3 : Ah another Water's Rise
2 : So
3 : shuffle that
2 : go to here and then grab four, Fool's Landing

3 : Watchtower
3 : that's gone
3 : and the Whispering Garden
1 : Apparently Breaker's Bridge got lost somewhere in there?
3 : That's gone
1 : I'm gonna assume it's gone then or should we just
1 : i don't know what happened to the card.
3 : This is
2 : I don't know, but either way it's your turn and you can just
1 : Ok so
2 : Lift us out
3 : Oh flip us first and then
1 : This is
3 : Flip
3 : Yeah
1 : I don't think it matters
1 : Yay, then we fly off.
3 : And then, yeah

4 : Oh boy
1 : Alright so
1 : should probably shore, shore these up.
1 : So if my first turn I'm gonna shore both these
1 : and then
1 : for my second turn I'll move to Temple
1 : of the Moon and shore both of these
1 : for my third
3 : Ok
1 : (final turn)
4 : Yeah
1 : Now we have that
3 : Two cards
1 : Yup, two
1 : Thanks
1 : Water Rises, so
4 : Right away
1 : That goes here
3 : I'll take that over here.
1 : Alright
1 : (--)
1 : (So I have one)
1 : and then,
3 : Shuffle those guys.
1 : Yup
1 : and then we have two.
1 : So Temple of the Moon and
1 : Breaker's Bridge
4 : So
1 : Is this (one)
1 : (the one I'm on).
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, Messenger.
2 : Ok,
1 : Messenger, you're up.
2 : so
3 : Doesn't look like we're really close to completing anything right now.
4 : No, but we're also not that close to dying so
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So can I just move?
2 : To Misty Marsh?
4 : Uh yeah
4 : Sure
2 : Um
4 : Um, well,
4 : unless
4 : I'm just thinking of
4 : if shoring up certain things is-
3 : Maybe shore up Temple of the Moon just before you go.
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : So go back, can I do that?
4 : Well, ju- just like take,
4 : take back that move.
3 : S-
3 : Yeah
4 : If, if that's
4 : Yeah, ok.
2 : I'm shoring up Temple of the Moon
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Then you might as well go
1 : down as well and
2 : To Temple of the Moon?
1 : Yup
1 : and then
1 : shore up
1 : Breaker,
1 : right?
4 : Sure, why not?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Guess the
3 : Not a lot we can do right now
1 : There's the next two, yeah.
4 : Right, yeah
3 : And these don't really matter all that much.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So then I take two of these?
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
2 : (Two) sandbags
1 : So
4 : Helpful
1 : Yeah
4 : Alright, and then, do we still get flood cards?
1 : Yeah, two flood cards.
4 : What do we got?
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and Golden Gate
4 : So Golden Gate's gone
1 : Which is fine
3 : I'll take the card. That Gold thingy
1 : And what's the other one?
3 : Thank you
2 : Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : So
1 : Nice
2 : So that's discarded.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Right
4 : Ok
1 : So (--) cards
3 : Alright
3 : my turn.
4 : Yes.
3 : So
1 : Not much to do.
3 : No
1 : I guess you could fly over and
3 : Um
1 : shore up.
2 : I can take
3 : So you have two of those
2 : Yeah, I can give you any of these cards.
4 : Yeah, you could shore up both of the places that need to be shored up right now.
3 : Mmhmm.
4 : Just by like
1 : Moving up one.
2 : You can- I can give you this can't I.
2 : Or no is that part of your
3 : No
1 : Yeah, we're- (--)
1 : We don't need to do that, yeah, I don't think
3 : I also don't know if you can trade these but you can play them
4 : Oh no I don't
3 : out of turn so
3 : it doesn't really matter.
1 : Yeah so maybe your first move, yeah
4 : Yeah, wait a minute.
3 : So I could go here
1 : Shore up
4 : Shore up
3 : two
1 : and then
4 : and then
3 : three, oh.
4 : Oh yeah
3 : No, so I can't do that.
4 : Well
1 : You can
4 : That, that one over there is probably more important than Phantom Rock
1 : fly.
3 : So I'll just, m-
4 : cause it's in the middle.
3 : I'll just move to your space,
4 : Sure!
3 : although I guess you're probably gonna move.
1 : What- what do we wanna
1 : move to?
3 : So I'll move here,
1 : Wait, wouldn't you wanna move to one of these- land on one of these?
4 : Nah
1 : Just in case, cause what if you-
1 : we all get it, we can all end up
3 : So I think I should try to get on the same space as other people, so that if I need to I can- we can give cards later
1 : Or maybe not
1 : Ok
1 : Uh
4 : That, that sounds like a good idea.
3 : So I'll just go here.
1 : Ok
4 : Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, does not
1 : I like it.
3 : I flew
1 : Yeah, he can fly there, Pilot
4 : Oh yeah!
4 : Helicopters
1 : Alright
1 : So then
3 : And I'll take my two
4 : Sure
1 : Two
3 : Chalice
3 : Another Helicopter Lift.
4 : Helicopter
1 : Nice
1 : Then there's still two floods
3 : Yeah
1 : So the Phantom of the Rock and the Lost Lagoon
3 : I'll take the rock card.
4 : What's Lost- Oh
1 : Right here.
4 : Ok
4 : So
4 : I can move diagonally to
4 : Isn't that exciting?
1 : Really not much to do
2 : You wanna try to get to
3 : S-
2 : Temple of the Moon?
4 : Yeah, well- No, what I can do is one, two, three.
2 : If you go to Cliffs of Aban-
1 : Or you could
3 : Or you could go
1 : I like that move
1 : Now we're all
3 : Or you could give her this
4 : Oh, that's very true. Um
4 : So
4 : Yeah, I kind of like that
4 : better
4 : um
1 : Yeah
2 : You give me that
4 : So,
2 : card.
4 : one,
4 : two,
4 : there you go.
2 : Then we can take
2 : that.
1 : No, not yet.
2 : Cause don't you have to have
4 : Not yet, you need one more.
3 : On your turn, yeah.
2 : Oh four, I thought it was three, four out of five
1 : You need f- and you need four, but we need
1 : (--)
3 : And you also need to get to either this space or this space.
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh, ok
1 : We gotta pick up two.
4 : And, oh look at that, we could get the
1 : (--)
1 : (--) two more.
4 : the, the blue one.
1 : Uh
1 : The Iron Gate and Whispering Garden.
2 : Chalice
4 : Whispering Gardens, (is that)
4 : right here. And Iron
4 : Gate is
1 : Right there.
3 : Oh
4 : Right
1 : Good
4 : Ok
4 : So now, we're in a position
4 : we can try and start plotting to get
3 : Both of those to him.
4 : Yeah, or
1 : Or I can just use two different turns
4 : Well yeah cause
1 : I don't have to move any (--)
1 : (Who)
1 : So we should give it
1 : oh wait
1 : We have to (--)
1 : That's ok.
4 : Well, give, giving a card takes up one turn right?
3 : And you have to- You can only give a- Like he can't take.
1 : Right
1 : I can give two.
4 : Right
2 : And I can give a card anytime.
3 : Oh I see, so if you give both to him
1 : I could give two
4 : You can?
4 : Is it anytime or anywhere?
1 : Yeah,
1 : both to you-
1 : Wait can you d-
2 : Give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card.
1 : Yeah look and then when
4 : Ok, but it still has to be your turn.
3 : So that's on your turn, yeah.
1 : (But) then you can go,
2 : Oh, when it's my turn, yeah.
1 : then you can go.
4 : mmhmm
1 : One,
1 : you can move him over to- If I give him both of mine
1 : then you can give him one and then you can f-
3 : Him the last one and then he can get it.
1 : Right
3 : Yeah
4 : (Nah)
1 : And you can move em there, so
3 : Mmhmm
1 : this is
1 : turn one,
4 : K, and yeah, that's good
1 : turn two,
4 : Cause that's five
1 : Right
1 : and then
2 : Oh yeah, we can only have five.
1 : uh
1 : I don't
1 : and then my- Oh wait, sh- should we (--)
3 : So you have a
1 : Yeah, it's fine.
2 : Can
4 : Yeah
1 : I don't need to move.
4 : You don't need to move, no
1 : I'm fine, with that
2 : Can-
2 : oh
1 : Or
1 : what else- Do we need anything else?
3 : I mean there's not
1 : I can only move
2 : I didn't know if you could shore up
3 : It would be nice to sh-
3 : It would be nice to shore this one up,
3 : just cause
4 : But I mean,
1 : You just gotta hope there's no Water Rising.
3 : Yeah
2 : True
1 : Cause it's already in the pile, as long as we don't get a Water Rise then we're alright.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So that's it, I'm good.
1 : Take two there.
3 : And if, if we do draw Water's Rise
3 : we can always sandbag it.
2 : True
1 : Of course, right
4 : Right
4 : So, do, do we wanna sandbag it immediately, just in case?
2 : I have a sandbag.
4 : Right
1 : Um
2 : I can give to him.
3 : Mm
4 : Yeah, cause I mean like once the flooding card is drawn, then it's gone.
1 : I don't think it-
1 : Does it matter?
3 : It's ok if we lose this one, but then we have to be extra protective of this one.
4 : So if we're gonna
1 : Cause we haven't- yeah, we have to keep that one.
4 : Ok, so
1 : So let's keep it.
4 : So- Yeah.
2 : Oh
1 : And then
3 : And you have to move the meter up.
1 : Oh yeah
4 : (--) get three.
1 : Take
1 : three.
1 : The first one's Lost Lagoon,
3 : Yeah we lost it.
1 : Cliffs of
3 : That was unintentional.
1 : Abandon.
4 : Yup
1 : And the Temple of the Moon.
2 : Mm
1 : which is ok, cause I'm glad I stayed there cause I could just bring them both back.
4 : Yeah
4 : Right
1 : Next turn.
1 : Ok
2 : Ok,
2 : so
2 : what should I do?
4 : Should she head
1 : You know what? You might as well use the sand-
3 : She should probably shore
3 : No, she- I mean she can shore up.
1 : Shore up
4 : Mmhmm
1 : No I think she sh-
3 : She can't do both, but
1 : You should probably sho- use a sandbag, because when you draw two cards
1 : you're gonna have to get rid of two cards.
2 : This-
3 : Eh
2 : Using the sandbag doesn't count as an action.
2 : Two, by the way.
4 : Right
1 : Right
3 : Yeah, so
1 : Because what if she
3 : Yeah, she's gonna have to discard a card anyway
1 : Right
1 : So you have to discard two cards.
4 : Well,
4 : I mean,
1 : Wait she'll have to-
1 : You know, we'll be able to pick out of it
4 : Yeah, I mean there's always the chance that she gets like two more chalices and then I mean we don't really need
1 : which ones
1 : Just throw
4 : (Wait) she could just get rid of those.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah, this is true, this is true.
2 : So,
4 : So just
1 : So no
4 : hold on to it for now.
1 : hold on to that.
4 : Um
4 : I'd think
1 : Yeah, shore up
2 : I can shore up
4 : Yeah, sho- shoring up probably the best.
1 : Shores
1 : Yeah it-
1 : Yeah you might as well cause there's only two cards now
1 : so
1 : they're gonna
1 : If we- if you pull a Water Rise's card then
1 : (--)
2 : Does it matter which ones I shore up?
1 : both,
1 : right?
2 : There's
4 : Yeah
4 : Um
4 : just
2 : should I
4 : Yeah
2 : Since the one we're on is probably more important I would- I mean like we're all on it.
3 : I mean yo-
4 : I mean
3 : Yeah
4 : It's
2 : If it gets sunk we're dead- we're done.
4 : Right, so, so, both of them.
1 : Yeah both of them will be
1 : (--)
3 : Plus like
3 : I don't know, I'm ok losing these ones out around the perimeter, but
1 : Yeah
1 : Right, me too
4 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Like we need to be able to navigate
4 : Mmhmm
3 : the main island, yeah.
2 : To Fool's Landing to
4 : Right
2 : So there's two moves.
2 : I don't have to go another move if I don't want to.
4 : Nope
2 : So treasure cards
2 : Sandbag
4 : Oh look at that!
2 : And the- this
4 : Well
1 : See
3 : Ok
4 : You, you, you could emergency use a sandbag, right now I think
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, so I would use one of the sandbags, maybe on this
1 : Use a sandbag but on-
2 : Ok
1 : yeah.
2 : Ok
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah, for sure.
3 : And then you still have to discard a card, so maybe just the fire one.
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah,
1 : perfect.
4 : And then
1 : And your next move-
1 : Oh, yeah.
4 : Next, next turn you can go and
1 : So now you ahve to pick three
2 : These
1 : of these, yeah.
4 : Yeah, and, and next turn you can go to the
2 : Mm
4 : Garden
2 : Just as a turn?
1 : Yeah
4 : get
1 : yeah one
1 : or
4 : (--) one, two
2 : Breaker's Bridge,
4 : (--) it.
3 : I can fly her there.
2 : Iron Gate, that's sunk,
2 : Iron Gate.
2 : Whispering Garden.
4 : Da da dun
1 : That was a good
4 : Um
3 : ok.
1 : And move there.
4 : So now
3 : I'll give you this
4 : Cool.
1 : (--)
3 : Oh you have to discard a card now.
1 : That's ok.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : That's fine.
3 : So that was one,
3 : um,
4 : Or mm, nope, nope, that's, that's how that had to happen, yeah.
1 : Would it be
1 : What about
1 : uh
3 : I can
1 : would it be s-
1 : cause the next move
1 : essentially would be
3 : I can fly here
3 : and shore this one up.
1 : You can fly there and she can give you all her card.
1 : Or you can only give one
3 : No, you ca- That would take four actions to give.
2 : I could sandbag the
1 : No, she's the, she's the Messenger I thought.
3 : But I can use the Helicopter
1 : Or you get these, or is it actually when you use it?
3 : I have a(n) idea
4 : (--)
2 : Oh, when I use the
1 : When you use your power
1 : it count as an action?
4 : I think it counts as an action for you, yeah.
3 : But it has to be her turn.
2 : For one action per card. Yeah it has to be my turn, I keep forgetting that.
3 : It has to be her turn.
1 : Oh ok
1 : Oh ok
3 : Yeah
2 : But I thought
3 : So
2 : to anyone when it is his or her turn.
3 : So the only thing I think
3 : what yours does is it lets you- Like you don't have to be on the same space as people.
2 : Mm
3 : So even if you're across the island you can give your cards to people
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Right
2 : But I think if it's on their turn I can give them a card, right?
1 : Uh, I see
1 : I see what you're saying, yeah.
4 : I- No, no, I- It still has to be your turn.
3 : I don't
3 : think so.
3 : Cause it says as an action,
2 : Look at the
3 : and the actions are only on your turn.
4 : Yeah, you can only make an action on your turn.
4 : To anyone, anywhere
2 : Oh
2 : when it's my turn. Sorry, read that wrong.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yes
3 : So I think what I'm gonna do um, is I'm gonna shore this up
4 : So we get two moves
4 : Right
1 : Yeah
3 : and then I'm gonna use a Helicopter Lift
3 : to move
3 : uh both of us
3 : to here.
3 : And then I'll use my lakst, last action to shore it up.
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Mm
4 : I like that.
3 : And then on your turn you don't have to move anywhere, you can just
3 : get this right away.
2 : K
1 : I like it.
3 : Everyone ok with that?
4 : I'm ok with that
1 : Yeah
4 : (--) Yep
3 : And flip that.
3 : (--)
4 : Fell off the island.
3 : And I'll draw two cards
4 : back up
3 : And if you can flip three of those for me.
4 : and then flood everything.
1 : Three of those.
3 : So, Copper Gate,
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : and Temple of the Sun.
4 : Hmm
4 : Alright
4 : so
1 : You gonna make it right to
1 : down here.
4 : Yeah, I can get there in two moves so that'll probably be
1 : And then your third one
4 : ideal.
1 : is- Does it move to collect the
4 : Yeah, so
1 : So that's one, two, three,
1 : and we get
1 : one of
4 : One,
4 : two,
4 : give me the cup.
4 : I think I discard these now.
1 : And then two,
1 : two cards.
4 : Oh boy, they're rising!
2 : Mm
1 : So
2 : move it up one.
4 : Moving on up
2 : Still three.
4 : Sure
4 : split in half
4 : is
1 : That goes over there.
4 : and then we get three.
1 : Yeah
4 : And it is- Oh look at that, the Temple of the Sun is gone.
4 : As is Copper Gate,
4 : and Breaker's Bridge is
2 : Sh-
1 : Sure
2 : or (flooded)
1 : flooded
4 : So,
4 : uh
4 : Temple of the Moon just
4 : became possibly important if we want to
1 : (--)
4 : get
3 : Mm
4 : the earth crystal.
1 : Which one is that?
4 : That's the purple one
3 : This one here
4 : Or
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah, grayish.
4 : Gray
1 : Um
4 : Uh the one that's purple Skittled color.
1 : So
1 : I'm gonna shore up this one
1 : and
1 : s- so (--) we'll have two of those.
4 : Yeah, I- I don't really know if there's anything else that you can do right now, like
4 : you
4 : are gonna be getting
4 : that one on your turn.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : I think that for us two we should probably try and get
1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : these
4 : to him
4 : as soon as possible.
3 : So he can move closer to- If he moves here then he's closer to both of us.
4 : That's true,
4 : that's true. And he's still within range to shore it up so
4 : that might be a good idea.
1 : Or
1 : we would have to go all the way around but
1 : I could give this
1 : to you.
1 : That way you could fly her
1 : at any point
3 : But you can't
4 : Yeah, you can't give to him unless
1 : Oh, I can't cause I'm not
3 : You can't get to me and give it to me this turn.
1 : Yeah, I'm too far.
3 : So if you move
1 : Um, just move one space to
4 : to Cliffs of Abandon which somehow are on the middle of the island
1 : Yeah, yeah I like that.
3 : Yeah
1 : I like that move.
4 : despite being seaside.
1 : Alright, that's good.
4 : Yeah
1 : So two of those cards.
1 : A Helicopter
4 : Oh boy there we go
3 : That helps
4 : That helps out a lot
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Uh
4 : Then flood the island.
1 : Crimson For- Forest.
3 : Is gone
4 : But
4 : oh dear
1 : (--) ok sorry
3 : No problem
1 : Uh
1 : Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : this is where I'm at.
1 : And then uh Whispering Gardens.
2 : Mm
4 : Get it done fast.
3 : Alright
2 : Now do I have to shore that up?
3 : You don't have to
4 : No you could just get it and then skedaddle.
2 : I can just get it?
1 : Yeah just
1 : Yeah so
2 : So I just discard these?
1 : Turn that in
1 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm.
3 : The other like benefit of shoring things up is that
2 : It's
3 : as these cards, as we run out of these cards we're gonna be tearing through those ones faster
4 : That's true, that's very true, so
2 : Yeah
3 : so if you can shore things up
4 : Yeah
4 : Do it.
2 : Should I just shore it up?
3 : Yeah I mean this
4 : Yeah
2 : As a move?
1 : Well
1 : yeah, I guess as a
1 : That's- It doesn't matter, either way
1 : So that's
3 : Or
4 : yeah, yeah, I think that's a
1 : That's fine, that's fine, yeah it's a smart move.
3 : Ok
2 : And then
1 : And then
1 : that's your second
2 : Discard these
1 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
2 : And then
1 : And then
1 : I mean
2 : Should I
2 : give this away, is this necessary?
1 : No
4 : I
1 : I would keep that cause you could-
1 : Like we just ran into the last time, you could use it at any point so
3 : Mm
4 : Actually
1 : Think you should use it
4 : I'm like- W-What I'm most worried about is this right here cause right now you guys can kinda move down there- Though you still have Helicopter Lift actually, so it's not that big a deal.
3 : Right
1 : Yes
3 : But
3 : yeah no I see what you're saying cause if we lost this then we would have to go around.
4 : But if that's gone, then you have to go all the way around so um
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Should I s-
1 : We don't need any of those
1 : really
3 : Hmm?
4 : Yeah, it, it, it's just a matter of taking an extra whole round
2 : Not now
4 : around the table
1 : Right
4 : to get back.
3 : Well I can, I can fix- I can shore this up on my turn.
4 : Yeah
3 : So if you just wanna move
3 : closer to Fool's Landing.
4 : to Misty Marsh!
2 : And then
1 : Yeah
2 : draw two?
1 : Yup
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh boy, fire.
3 : Ok
1 : nice
4 : Back up plan.
2 : And then three.
1 : Yup
2 : Silver Gate, Tidal Palace, and Temple of the Moon.
1 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Silver Gate
1 : What's the other one?
3 : Tidal Palace.
4 : It's over there, yeah.
3 : Ok
1 : Well
4 : So now
3 : So
3 : I think
3 : for my first action
3 : Mm
3 : So I'm gonna fly here
4 : Mmhmm
3 : and then I'm gonna give this
3 : to the Engineer.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : And then I was gonna shore up this but I think I need to shore up this.
4 : Yeah I think that that's the best idea right now.
3 : And that's my three.
2 : Mm
4 : Ok
4 : You can always swim over to the Temple of the Moon,
4 : need be.
4 : Right?
4 : Ok, so
2 : Mm then
2 : three cards
3 : Oh yeah
3 : So Bronze Gate,
1 : Got it
3 : Cave of Shadows,
3 : and the Dunes of Deception.
4 : Cool
4 : so
4 : oo
1 : Which piece are you, the green one?
4 : Yeah
4 : So obviously I need to get up to you
4 : Oh well the- there's not really a one,
4 : two,
4 : that's all that I can do.
3 : Three
1 : And then I, I have too many, so I have to
3 : Mmhmm
1 : I'm gonna have to discard this.
4 : Yeah, just discard that one, that'll be fine.
4 : And I get
4 : two cards, and let's hope that nothing gets destroyed. And oh look at that, everything's ok!
4 : And whole rest of the world is flooded
4 : Cave of Embers, Misty Marsh, and the Howling Garden.
1 : So
1 : (--)
4 : (--)
4 : Yeah, no, never mind, do it.
1 : You think the
1 : shore up
1 : two of them first
4 : Well, I'm just looking at- how many Helicopter lifts do we have?
1 : I have one,
1 : you have two.
4 : Eh, I might (--)
4 : maybe
2 : Could I
4 : shore up these two and then hop over here and
2 : see it
2 : uh
1 : Then
1 : three of the- yeah, so
1 : Shore up that one.
1 : And move
1 : to
1 : now we gotta get the hell off this island.
4 : Alright
1 : So two of those, yup.
2 : (--) you get two
2 : NnMm
1 : And of course
3 : Ok
1 : (--) but also that goes
3 : Yeah, so raise that
1 : over there. This
2 : (--)
1 : three.
3 : Then shuffle those
2 : Oh yeah
1 : We're screwed.
3 : So we have
4 : W-we have
3 : three Helicopter Lift cards and we have three treasures
1 : And we can use them whenever right?
3 : and I think
3 : Yeah
4 : can be used (--)
3 : so
1 : So I might as well
4 : Just- I mean if you can play a Helicopter Lift card immediately and just move
1 : I might as well
1 : move there now.
1 : (--)
4 : Um
3 : And then
3 : Cause
1 : Wait, we can- We also have a s-
1 : Wait before we
4 : Can be used to fly one or more (--) adventurers
1 : may be able to sandbag.
3 : I don't think there's anything we need to sandbag, we just need to get off the island now.
2 : You take three
1 : Good
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah so you could activate one of the Helicopter Lifts and just
4 : teleport us over there.
3 : Well
3 : let's play these out first.
4 : Or yeah, let's take a look at what we've got
1 : Yeah, so Misty Marsh
2 : I sunk
3 : Right
4 : Ok, so move
2 : So I'm
3 : But then you can just move
2 : Oh
4 : Swim over to here.
2 : Do I move that
2 : on my turn or just
1 : There you are
1 : No
3 : I'll take that
1 : Oh sorry
4 : I think that it happens automatically doesn't it?
3 : Yeah
1 : Howling Garden,
1 : gone.
1 : And Tidal Palace
3 : Also gone.
2 : Mm
4 : Not
3 : Alright
1 : Ok
4 : Not the worst one to remove.
1 : So I can use my Helicopter Lift now
3 : Yeah, and go to Fool's Landing
1 : Move one or more pawns at the same tile to any
3 : Oh and now we're all on the same so we could just play all three and win right now.
1 : Yeah sweet.
4 : Well
1 : (--), yeah, we're good.
2 : Don't you need the
3 : Right?
4 : If you- If you use yours
1 : Now we don't we just need, we just need three, four.
2 : Oh
3 : He plays his- he plays both of his, and moves him and then all three of us here and then I play mine and then we win.
1 : Yeah so
2 : Mmhmm
4 : It only works on two people though, doesn't it?
3 : Does it?
1 : Any times (--) that counts as an action card
4 : Like
4 : move one or more
1 : No I can move as many as people
4 : Oh, one or more pawns!
1 : So why don't
4 : Yeah, so, so it's just
1 : Oh yeah, so move myself
2 : to here?
1 : Yeah, yeah, so I'll move myself to there. There's that one.
3 : mmhmm
4 : And then
3 : use that one to get
2 : Move the rest of us.
1 : Wait
4 : The rest of us, but then you need to still play
1 : no I have to be on there.
3 : No, you don't
1 : Nah
4 : Then you need to play yours in order for us to actually leave the island, but in theory we should be able to survive
3 : Right
3 : But we don't have to wait till my turn
4 : Oh you don't?
3 : Play it at anytime
4 : Oh cool, yeah, so
4 : Yeah, just throw us there and then you play that and then
4 : put it in the discard pile to make it official
4 : ok.

1 : Ok well, I go here
1 : and shore this up
1 : and if you can pass me two Treasure cards please?
1 : Thank you
1 : Water Rise
1 : Ok, (--) then I have to flood these two
1 : So
1 : Uh it's gonna
1 : shuffled it
1 : Got it.
1 : Oh, sorry, ok
1 : (Sweet)
1 : Wait
1 : I shuffle this, then I put it back before I take these two?
1 : Oh, got it
1 : Sorry, it's already the first move
1 : and then you put it back here, ok.
1 : And this tick
1 : Then I'll take two.
1 : So Whispering Garden and Breaker's Bridge
1 : Which, yeah
1 : Mm
3 : Right underneath it.
1 : Oh thank you. Oh
1 : Ok
1 : And
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : Move here
2 : And
2 : Can you flip that over?
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Mm
2 : And I'm gonna give you this one
1 : Thanks.
2 : And so I'll take two
2 : Ok it's
2 : (--) two
2 : Can you flip
2 : Temple of the Moon?
1 : So what was it?
2 : That one
2 : Yeah, that one, and
1 : Oh
2 : Iron Gate
2 : Which is right here.
1 : Ok.
3 : And
3 : I'm gonna
3 : fly to
3 : Lost Lagoon,
3 : and then I'm gonna shore it up, could you-?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : That's like one, two
3 : and then
3 : How many- We're allowed to shore up two right?
1 : Oh I can only
3 : Or only one per person?
1 : shore up
1 : two, yeah.
3 : We can shore up two
3 : Oh
2 : I mean that can be your other action
1 : Yeah
3 : As shoring up another island right?
1 : Mmhmm it's a move.
2 : Yeah
3 : So I'll do that
3 : Shore that up
3 : and then
3 : Ok
3 : Can I have two of those?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Thank you
3 : Alright, I got Golden Gate and Lost Lagoon
1 : oh, ok
2 : No, no, no, it's- It goes
3 : Oh, sorry, yeah, you're right. Sorry about that
3 : And where's Lost Lagoon?
3 : Of course
1 : Yeah
2 : You have to get rid of that one
1 : The
2 : The Golden Gate, yeah
1 : Yes
1 : Ah ok, that's my turn
1 : Um (I'll go)
1 : This way
1 : And
1 : (great)
1 : Then
1 : can I have two Treasure cards?
1 : But I have two, three
1 : Ok
1 : Is this too much? (two, four six) That's too much. so then I have to discard one
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Uh let's
1 : Do this one
1 : Maybe? Yep
3 : Yeah, that's right
2 : Yeah
1 : And
1 : two of these Phantom Rock and Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Oh, that means we have to
1 : take this.
3 : Thank you
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : um
2 : I'm gonna use that, um
2 : I'm gonna go
2 : back to Silver Gate
2 : And
2 : um
2 : Ok
2 : um I'll just draw two now
2 : Water's Rise
2 : So it's um Iron Gate
3 : Iron Gate
2 : so
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : and Cliffs of Abandon, so this one's gone too.
1 : Oh, here it is
2 : Ok
3 : (--)
2 : Oh, it's, uh we got rid of that one.
2 : Did I give you the wrong one?
3 : You gave me Breaker's Bridge, yeah
2 : Yeah, ok
2 : K
3 : Alright, so
2 : You should give her that
3 : Yeah, I have to move to the same tile first so
1 : Yes
2 : Oh, I thought you could just (be adjacent).
3 : So
3 : I could move there.
2 : Ok
3 : I'm gonna shore that up too
3 : So, that's that and then I'm gonna- for my third action I'm gonna give you this.
1 : K
3 : Alright, but now you have to discard one.
1 : So now do I
1 : discard one?
1 : Ok
1 : Well, this one.
1 : Do I just like take this
2 : No
1 : with me? How do I
2 : You need to like
2 : go here.
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh we have to go to it, yeah it's right
1 : Gotcha
3 : So, now two Treasure deck
3 : cards right?
3 : Uh, have you been discarding these, no?
3 : So I'm gonna discard that one.
3 : Um
3 : Ok, I'm gonna
3 : draw two flood cards
1 : Oh it has to be three now, yeah.
2 : Three.
3 : Wait, did I
3 : I didn't have to discard that hm
3 : Alright
3 : We have Whispering Garden,
3 : Temple of the Moon,
3 : so this is sunk.
1 : Oh, k
2 : Oh man
3 : Lost Lagoon,
3 : Whispering Garden,
3 : do we get Lost Lagoon?
1 : What is it?
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : No, look in there
3 : Ok
3 : And those go back.
1 : Ok.
1 : Um
2 : I mean you should've used a helicopter to move her
2 : over here.
3 : Well that doesn't take up a turn, right?
3 : So it doesn't count as an action?
2 : No
1 : Oh, it doesn't.
2 : Yeah
3 : So I can
3 : Where you wanna go?
1 : Oh I would like to go here, please, right here where she is
3 : Go for it.
1 : This one, yeah, then I'll get the- this thing, right
3 : And then I'll just
3 : Yeah
2 : So then those
2 : Yeah
1 : Can I just discard them?
1 : Right
1 : Or do we keep them- I don't know, how this works
2 : I guess so
1 : or
3 : I think you discard them.
1 : You just discard them?
2 : Um

3 : (--)
3 : When you capture treasure discard the cards
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, cool
1 : Um
1 : Alright
1 : I'll just move here
1 : Can I shore up things?
1 : They only- they only have to be next to me right?
1 : Or I can do any
1 : Ok
3 : I think they have to be adjacent
2 : Yeah, yeah
1 : Adjacent to me, oh
3 : So I don't think you can do that.
1 : Mm
1 : OK
1 : I can't do anything, then I'll just
1 : Take the treasure
1 : These
1 : I have Copper Gate, Crimson Forest, Howling Garden
1 : Copper Gate,
1 : Crimson Forest,
1 : Howling Garden
2 : Uh um, I'm gonna use the Sandbag thing
2 : and keep,
2 : keep Whispering Gardens and shore it up
2 : Um,
2 : I'm going to
2 : I'm only allowed to keep two, one at a time, so
2 : which one of you is closest to this?
2 : Cause the other one's gone.
2 : I'll give it to you
1 : Ok
2 : so we can go for this one.
3 : Yeah
3 : that's fine.
2 : Um
2 : Alright, yeah then I'll take two.
2 : Ok, Water's Rise
2 : Three.
2 : Crimson Forest, so that's gone, that's at the top
1 : Ok
2 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : so the middle yeah.
2 : And Whispering Gardens
1 : Hm
2 : Yeah, ok.
2 : Ok, your turn.
3 : Ok, well
3 : I'm gonna
3 : shore up
3 : Breaker's Bridge
3 : and
3 : Whispering Gardens.
3 : Wait
1 : Hm?
2 : Those are like two actions
3 : Does moving a- Yeah it's two actions, I'm wanna move the,
3 : I'm gonna move here.
2 : So you can give it to her.
3 : So I can give you
3 : this.
1 : Thanks
3 : And
3 : oh actually, I'll just use my Sandbag
2 : Yea-
2 : Yeah, you should keep one of the two.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : to shore this up.
3 : One of those.
3 : And two Treasure cards.
3 : Another Helicopter
1 : Oh good.
3 : And I need three Flood cards.
3 : Thank you
3 : Alright, Howling Garden is gone
1 : Hmm
2 : Ok
3 : Uh Copper Gate
3 : and Lost Lagoon is gone now.
3 : That was a really bad one, (--)
2 : Yeah
1 : Uh huh
3 : (--)
3 : And
3 : That's it
3 : your turn
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Um, well, let's go here
1 : And there's nothing to shore up right? so
2 : Oh you should've gone down towards her.
1 : Oh
1 : Can I retract that?
2 : I don't know
1 : Ok, um
1 : Good call
1 : Uh,
1 : yeah, then uh
1 : just take up
1 : two Treasure cards
1 : Oh
1 : Well
1 : I should've just stayed where I was
2 : Yeah
1 : Maybe I'll just wait
1 : Um so
3 : I can Helicopter Lift here on my turn.
1 : Ok, that works for me.
2 : So you guys get rid of those, yeah
3 : If need be
1 : These things
3 : Saves us a turn.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
3 : Sorry
1 : And these three hopefully it's not-
1 : one of those
1 : Dunes of Deception,
1 : Silver Gate,
1 : which is right here,
1 : and Cave
1 : of Embers.
2 : Oh god
1 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : Ok, I'm gonna
2 : get off that.
2 : I'm going to give you this one,
2 : just in case
3 : Thank you.
2 : I get close to that
2 : Um
2 : And I might (--)
2 : I'll
2 : Shore this one up.
2 : since I'm adjacent
2 : Ok
2 : one of each.
2 : Ok
2 : Tidal Palace,
1 : Mm
2 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Coral Palace
2 : Ok
1 : Oh ok
3 : So I'm gonna shore this up
3 : Um
3 : And then
3 : what should I do next?
3 : You need
2 : I mean, since you shored it up, she can just move over and do it on her turn, so we don't need to
3 : Yeah
3 : Yeah, we can just do that, we can save these.
2 : Yeah
3 : And then
3 : I can fly to anywhere really. Do we still have flame cards?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Do we have flame cards?
1 : What cards?
2 : We already
3 : Well we can keep this option open. So should I fly here?
3 : Or like move here
1 : Yeah
3 : And use my last action to shore this up.
3 : I think
1 : That's a good idea, yeah
3 : So
2 : We don't need to shore that one up.
2 : Oh, cause we get- guess we need to
3 : Yeah, cause we can have the embers
3 : just in case we get the
2 : But we already-
3 : Oh, we already got that one.
1 : Oh we co-, yeah we (--)
2 : But I mean
2 : we would still need to get there- Oh wait no, if we're gonna get this one then- Ok.
3 : Well
3 : that's out of the question.
1 : Yeah
2 : They don't necessarily matter.
3 : Maybe it'll just be best, cause, just to keep tiles I can fly there and shore it up anyway
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : And then
3 : (--)
3 : So two Treasure Cards
3 : I have to discard one- One, two, three, four, five
3 : Nope, that's six.
2 : Yeah I think you should do it, do those two.
1 : Oh
2 : The one's- the two that you got.
3 : This one
3 : Well this is five
2 : Oh yeah
3 : So, it's fine
2 : Ok
1 : Cool
3 : And then um
3 : three.
1 : Oh
3 : Oh the Forbidden (--)
1 : Ok
2 : da da da
1 : Oh no
3 : Alright, oh no
3 : Temple of the Sun
3 : alright, no harm done there. Misty Marsh
3 : and Watchtower.
1 : Mm
2 : Ok
1 : Ok cool
1 : Ok, well I'm just gonna
1 : go here,
1 : take this
1 : and I could probably- Oh
1 : I can't shore this up.
1 : Can I move again?
3 : You can move again. That's- You have three actions.
2 : Yeah
1 : K, so I moved once,
1 : that's my second move,
2 : Yeah, I think you're done.
2 : Or yeah, cause you can go treasure.
1 : Yeah
2 : Capture one
1 : Maybe I'll just chill at
1 : Fool's Landing instead.
1 : Just
1 : just in case, I don't know why.
1 : Um can I have
1 : two treasure?
2 : (--) gotta get rid of those.
1 : Oh yeah
1 : Thanks
3 : Yeah
1 : And thank you
1 : Water's Rise
2 : Oh no
1 : I know
1 : That
2 : So we only need one more
3 : We're not at a risk of losing any important tiles.
1 : Nah, we wanna keep
2 : Yeah, we only need
3 : I have two of these, like wind thingies.
2 : I can give you this one and let's see what you draw next.
3 : Yeah
2 : And you can fly yourself
1 : Yeah
2 : to where I am.
3 : Whispering Garden, yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Unless it gets pulled
1 : Let's hope not
1 : Dunes of Deception
1 : (Aw it's out)
1 : K
1 : Um, Cave of Embers,
1 : Ok
1 : Misty Marsh,
1 : which is
2 : Oh ok, my turn?
1 : Yeah, mmhmm
2 : Ok, so I'm gonna give you this one
2 : Um, where am I? Over here. So
2 : I'm just gonna keep this one alive
1 : K
2 : And, my other one I'm just gonna give you this just in case we can't get that one.
1 : Ok, good idea
3 : Good idea
3 : (--)
2 : Ok, ok, ok
1 : Nice, yay we're close
2 : Um, oh I need
2 : these three.
2 : Oh there's two there
2 : No!
1 : What?
2 : Ok, Whispering Gardens
1 : It's ok
3 : So Watchtower?
2 : Yeah
2 : Coral Palace
2 : We gotta keep that one otherwise we can't get back to Fool's
1 : Oh yeah
1 : ok
2 : Ok,
2 : your turn.
1 : Hmm
3 : So
1 : Maybe you should
3 : Where's the-
3 : I'm gonna shore this up,
1 : Yup
3 : fly over there and shore that up
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh yup
3 : Can you flip that?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Thank you.
2 : Ok good
1 : Ok
2 : Oh don't you need to
3 : Oh yeah, two Treasure Cards
3 : Oh this is a tough one
3 : Should I
3 : keep a Helicopter Lift and give-
3 : or get rid of a Helicopter Lift?
2 : I think
3 : and keep the sandbag?
2 : Yeah, I mean she can always get us out as long as we
3 : So I can transfer that
2 : I mean I don't know if- yeah
3 : Yeah, I think that's a good idea
1 : Alright
3 : cause you can just swing (--) that next time
2 : Yeah
1 : Sounds good
3 : You just have to keep that watch on Garden
2 : And you can fly us over and she can take us out, ok
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Mm, k
2 : No, no, no you should probably stay there.
3 : Yeah, stay there
1 : Stay there? Oh, even though
1 : You wanna
3 : Cause you have to keep Fool's
1 : Oh we can capture that one too.
2 : Oh, oh, oh you- Oh wait, he f-
1 : (we could) just
2 : You have to draw those, those three flood cards.
3 : Oh I didn't do that, yeah good call.
1 : Oh yeah
3 : Bronze Gate,
3 : uh Silver Gate,
3 : and Tidal Palace.
1 : Hm
2 : Oh, ok
1 : Ok
2 : Now it's your turn
3 : So, wait we should keep
2 : Yeah I think you should stay there
3 : But we need Coral Palace to stay
2 : But she could still do it, she's,
2 : she is adjacent to it.
3 : Ok, y- yeah, you're right
2 : You can still
1 : Ok
1 : Oh yeah that was just to shore it up right?
2 : like shore it up.
1 : Let's do that
1 : Oh
1 : Oh, I can't really move anywhere else now.
1 : I could just
1 : It's fine
3 : Whatever you can just stay
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : That's fine
2 : so um all you need to do
1 : Oh I need to do the treasure thing.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yes
1 : That's two
1 : Observatory
1 : Um, Breaker's Bridge,
1 : Temples of the Sun,
2 : ok so that one's gone.
1 : Ok, so that option's
1 : out.
2 : Not
3 : Yeah we can't get that one
2 : an option.
1 : Yeah
1 : So now we just need to
2 : Oh you, you just (moved) that didn't you? Ok, so here
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : Thank you
2 : Ok, um
3 : I have to get rid of a card though
2 : You should get rid of the sandbags
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So
2 : yeah.
2 : Um
2 : I'm gonna
2 : I'm gonna shore this up
2 : and I can do another one, right?
1 : Yeah, for your second action, mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : Third action, ok, so that's my third action.
2 : Oh ok, Water's Rise
1 : Oh no
2 : Um
2 : We're at four now.
2 : Good.
2 : So, one, two,
2 : three, four,
2 : Breaker's Bridge,
2 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Coral Palace.
2 : And Cave of Embers ok.
2 : That's my turn.
3 : Ok
2 : So you're gonna
3 : I'm gonna take this little thingy
3 : Put that there, these go there.
3 : And I'm going to
3 : move myself
2 : You can take both of us
3 : So I'm blue right?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Oh
3 : Oh yeah, well, and then I'm gonna Helicopter Lift you. So that's my three actions or whatever
1 : Oh
3 : Or well, two actions, and then a helicopter lift
2 : Yeah
3 : Don't really need these, we need four of them
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : Um
1 : Oh cool
3 : The Observatory
1 : Oh yes
3 : Uh Whispering Garden,
3 : Silver Gate,
3 : so Silver Gate is gone, and s-
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Cave of Embers is gone as well.
3 : So
3 : Whispering Garden (goes back in here)
2 : Mm Ok
1 : Ok
1 : Cool
1 : Well
1 : to win we have all these things and I have a Helicopter thing so
1 : I think we just won.
2 : Yeah
3 : I think we won.
1 : Nice
3 : Good job team
1 : Good job
2 : Thirteen minutes left.
1 : Oh I didn't even know that was there

1 : Ok
2 : Ok
1 : So I think moving to the Temple of the Moon would be my first action.
3 : Yeah that makes sense.
1 : Shore it up and then shore up Cliffs Abandon and breakless- Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Cool
1 : Move
1 : Shore up
1 : And
4 : Oh yeah cause you can do two.
1 : Shore up
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
2 : Good work
1 : And then two Treasure cards.
1 : Thank you
1 : Water's Rise. That was fast.
1 : Ok
1 : (--)
1 : These get
1 : shuffled.
2 : I could take those for you, put it over here
1 : Put back on top
1 : And then I take two
1 : So Breaker's Bridge
1 : goes back under
1 : And the Gold Gate
2 : Ok so that gets sunk
1 : Ok
4 : That was also fast.
2 : Ok
2 : Ok so
2 : I think my first action I'm gonna give you my Statue of the Wind.
3 : You have to be on the same tile I think.
2 : No cause I'm the Messenger so I can give it to anyone.
1 : She's the Messenger.
3 : Oh there you go.
4 : Oh
2 : Um so we're gonna do that
4 : Thanks
2 : and then
2 : ok
2 : I guess I'll just make
2 : two
2 : moves cause that's really the only other thing that I see beneficial so one
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : That's three actions
2 : Take two cards
4 : Can only the Messenger give away these
2 : Everyone can but I can give them to anywhere, anyone. All of you can only give them away
4 : cards?
3 : Yeah we have to be in the same tile and then we can do it for one action.
1 : We have to be on the same tile.
2 : If there and then
4 : Got it ok thanks
2 : Two Flood cards, so Temple of the Moon
2 : and phantom Rock
1 : Oh no
4 : Uh oh
3 : Phantom Rock's gone is all.
2 : Ah yes yup
1 : Wow
2 : At least they're on the outside.
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : Alright um
3 : I guess
3 : You can go over there did you
1 : Shore things up
3 : Prevent it from yeah
2 : Yeah I would do that
3 : I'll go over here
1 : Mmhmm
3 : And then I'll shore
3 : These two as my two (--)
2 : Ah You know what I would shore the two that are kinda on the inside. Cause like if the outside falls (--) that's that's kinda alright.
3 : Ok that's fine.
4 : Mm that's a good idea.
3 : That's fine so I'll shore both of those up
4 : Mmhmm
3 : as my
3 : second
3 : and third action.
2 : Awesome
4 : Ooo two Helicopters
1 : Nice
2 : Nice, perfect.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : And two (can you lift them)
2 : Two of these.
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : We got that for you. Alright that one's gone.
3 : And Lost Lagoon
1 : Lost Lagoon is gone
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : Ok
4 : Ok my turn
4 : Um
4 : maybe I go here
4 : and then
4 : I could
4 : Oh never mind we have the Chalice
2 : Wait you can take- you can take a card for me though
1 : But you can still
4 : Yeah oh I'll take the Lion from you
2 : So perfect
3 : Can you take as well as give?
2 : Yeah
2 : Cause you can't or oh, it's give a treasure card, I lied.
4 : Oh
2 : Sorry
4 : Darn
4 : Ok
1 : But you can still move toward the Howling Garden or the whispering Garden so that
1 : so you're prepared when you get all four.
2 : Yeah that's a good idea.
4 : Ok
4 : Where is it?
2 : I would move up to Misty Marsh.
1 : South
1 : Either north or south
4 : Oh I see ok so that w- that was my first move right?
2 : Mmhmm or well you moved one and then you flipped the tile, so that's three
4 : So
1 : You did two cause you moved and then flipped.
4 : Ok
2 : And then
4 : And two
4 : So I got
4 : so I have
4 : five
4 : thank you
4 : Whispering Garden
2 : Let's be on the look out for that one
3 : (no)
4 : And Iron Gate
2 : Alright
4 : Ok
2 : Cool
1 : Ok
2 : Alrighty
1 : So
1 : Let's see I should maybe move toward the Whispering Garden to shore it up.
2 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
1 : And keep that safe, so one, two
1 : three
4 : Nice
1 : And then two treasure cards thank you
2 : Ah
1 : Ah
1 : again
2 : (--) at three now, oh no.
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : Is there a way to make that stop or go down again?
2 : I don't think so
3 : I don't think so
4 : No? ok
1 : That would be too easy
1 : Ok so three of these
2 : Oh that's painful
1 : Who's going down this time?
4 : I know
1 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Braker's Bridge is ok
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Where's Cliffs of Abandon
1 : And the Temple of the Moon
2 : Where's Cliffs of Abandon? Oh right there. Ok that's
4 : There you go
2 : That's not the worst thing that could have happened.
3 : Yeah
3 : We're all near all of those.
4 : Right
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Good? alright.
1 : Yup
2 : I'm gonna give you, there's my one.
4 : Thank you
4 : Oh I have to discard one though.
2 : Discard, Ooo
1 : Ooo
4 : Cause I can only have five at once.
2 : Discard your
1 : Wait if you're on the same tile as me can you give me one right now as a discard? Ok.
3 : No cause it's her turn.
2 : No
4 : Only on my turn.
2 : Hmm um
1 : Ok
3 : You just have to-
2 : Discard the Chalice
3 : Yeah I think that makes sense.
4 : Yeah
2 : Does it go in th- uh- here then? Ok and then um
3 : In here yeah.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So that was my first move, here's my second.
2 : And yeah I'm gonna sit and this will be my third. Perfect.
3 : I'd do that one cause
4 : Yeah
4 : Cause that's an important one
2 : Can I (have) two?
4 : Oh two Sandbags are out
2 : Perfect. Nice and now I select three.
1 : Nice
2 : Ok Temple of the Moon
4 : Can you use a Sandbag
4 : after you
4 : pick up
4 : one of these ah
2 : If they're in here you can't use it
3 : You, we can't look at the card before we sandbag it
2 : Whispering Garden
1 : Again?
4 : Ok
2 : and Iron Gate.
2 : Ok Iron Gate's gone.
3 : Alright
3 : Um
4 : Alright
3 : So
3 : I'm gonna
3 : wanna shore that up but I feel like cards should be moving.
3 : Ah
3 : Ah whatever
3 : I'll shore this up for my first action.
3 : And I'll move over here
3 : and shore this up
2 : Good call
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright two cards
3 : Mmhmm
3 : I have to discard now. I have to discard one of these.
3 : Ah
2 : Discard the Chalice, Ooo no.
3 : Um you shouldn't
4 : I know, I was just thinking
2 : Mm
1 : Discard the Statue of the Wind because we have four in play
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh we already have four in play?
2 : Cool
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Yeah you can give that one
2 : No this one.
3 : And her whenever you want huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah so I should discard this one.
2 : Th- this one yup, mmhmm, ok.
2 : There it goes
3 : Alright
3 : Tidal Palace
3 : Copper Gate
2 : Right there
3 : And Crimson Forest
2 : Alright
2 : Good to go.
4 : Ok
4 : So
4 : I'm thinking that
4 : If I get rid of one, like give this to you then you can give the Lion to me.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah next time? Yeah without the
4 : On your turn?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : getting rid of it?
4 : Yeah alright so that's one.
1 : Ok
4 : Then we should
4 : Mm I guess we're far away from that. Well I guess I can just do diagonal.
2 : maybe shore
3 : Well you want to be close to this right?
4 : Right?
2 : Yeah I would- I would shore up, I would shore up Crimson Forest and Copper Gate cause you can shore up diagonally.
3 : So we can eventually capture.
4 : Mm you're right.
1 : Yeah I'll shore up
4 : That's right
1 : Mm
2 : As two turn
4 : At the same time
2 : It would just yup
4 : Like as one and then two yeah
4 : Ok thanks
1 : So was that two or three then?
4 : I think that was three cause I gave one and then two three
3 : Yeah cause he gave you
2 : Yeah ok yup you're two and
1 : Ok
3 : She gave you one
4 : And I need
3 : Yeah
4 : two
3 : And then your next turn you'll move there after you have those yeah
2 : Three
4 : Right and then get
4 : And then we'll get our thing
4 : Alright
4 : Ehh
1 : Oh no
2 : Ah ok
4 : Water's Rise
4 : Challenge
4 : I discard
2 : Is everyone confident with that shuffling? Alright now you get three.
4 : I'm a little nervous. As long as it's not the Palace? Ooo
2 : I know
2 : Ooo
4 : It is Whispering Garden! Ah
4 : again
2 : Alright that's ok.
3 : Well it's ok it didn't sink.
4 : And Temple of the Sun
2 : Temple of the Sun, oh no it's Temple of the Moon
2 : Temple of the Sun, oh here we go.
1 : Down there
4 : Ok
4 : Ah that's important.
4 : And Crimson Forest
2 : Crimson Forest, ok that's not bad. Cool, cool.
4 : ok
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah
1 : Alright
1 : So
1 : I can move up and save these two
2 : Yeah
3 : You don't even have to move it right?
4 : Yeah
1 : Ah well I have to if I want to save the diagonal one
3 : Ok wait you can
4 : Yeah cause he's not diagonal.
3 : You cou- just that one
3 : I don't-
3 : Do you think that saving Crimson Forest was (really that)
1 : Mm
4 : Actually that's a good point.
3 : Big a deal
1 : That is true yeah
2 : Yeah maybe just shore up the one
1 : So
1 : take this as one
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : Get yourself to near like Temple of the Moon or near one of the ones with the Chalice.
1 : Two, three
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Since you've got two of each
4 : Actually both of them are
4 : flooded and you have
2 : Mmhmm. Well we've got Temple of the Moon there and Coral Palace here as well.
4 : Yeah that's all good.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright so I'll move toward the Tidal Palace.
2 : Yup
3 : I think so
4 : Yeah
1 : Alright so that'll be two and three.
4 : Yup
1 : Ok, two of these.
4 : So long as it doesn't flood right now.
2 : Yeah really.
4 : I mean disappear whatever that's called.
1 : Alright so we have two Helicopter Lifts in place. I'll discard
1 : mine. Does that seem wise?
2 : What else do you have?
1 : Ah
3 : Yeah I think that should be fine
1 : Two Chalice
2 : Um
1 : Three Earth Stone
4 : I don't
4 : If we can keep a Helicopter Lift it seems like that's
1 : prudent
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : So
4 : Of course
1 : Two and two
3 : We can you can yeah like
2 : I would yeah
3 : because we have these two yeah
1 : yeah that can work ok
2 : Yeah that's good cool
1 : Alright and then
1 : three of those thank you
2 : three
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Once again
1 : And Breaker's Bridge gone.
2 : Oh Breaker's Bridge is gone.
1 : With the card and the Copper Gate.
2 : Copper Gate is here cool. ok so here's
4 : Ok once again we're alright, we're skating through.
1 : ok
3 : So we could also
3 : Like if
3 : if we'll- if we need them we could use those Sandbags eventually like before these guys sink.
2 : Yeah yup, there's that for you. Ok so that's my one.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh that's true.
4 : Yay
3 : And then you have to discard one of yours
4 : Oh yeah
4 : Uh
4 : which one?
3 : Um
2 : mm
1 : Pick one
2 : I would say, I would say the, I would say the Moon.
3 : Yeah
4 : It doesn't matter really, the Moon
4 : Ok
1 : Yeah cause I'm closer to the Chalice
2 : Mmhmm oh that goes over here. Ok so that's one.
3 : Yeah
4 : Nope
3 : It's over here yeah.
2 : I'll save Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Yeah it's in a prime spot.
2 : and
2 : um
2 : I guess let's move here just in case.
4 : Mm
4 : Yeah I was gonna say that
4 : in case we would need to like give others away
2 : Yup
1 : Good card swapping
4 : Yeah card swapping
3 : Ok
3 : Alright then um
4 : Oh you can
4 : save uh oh no that's you, just kidding
3 : Yeah I mean I could go here and shore both of these up
2 : You're green
4 : Oh wait what color are you? You're blue.
1 : That seems like waste cause I can take these two.
2 : Ooo hold on sorry. I forgot my cards.
4 : Yeah you can do that.
3 : Oh Ok
1 : So maybe go down here or something to Garden
2 : Here hold
2 : Sorry I have to finish my, my turn, I forgot to, I forgot my cards sorry.
4 : Uh oh
4 : Oh look at that Fire sweet.
1 : Ah
3 : Oh yeah
4 : Oh then you can give her a Fire.
4 : And then
2 : And then alright so we have
2 : Silver Gate
2 : which is here, Tidal Palace is gone. That's alright we just have to watch Coral Palace ooo oh ok and Temple of the Moon. That's ok.
4 : Uh
1 : No
4 : Uh oh
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
4 : So
4 : We
4 : We have to save these three
2 : We have to save yeah
4 : or we can't win.
2 : Ok um
3 : Yeah
2 : Do we want to use Sandbag's uh oh never mind, we can't yet
4 : We can't
2 : Right but now it's your turn
4 : Darn we're so close
3 : Ok
4 : I guess we
4 : chanced it too long?
3 : So
3 : I mean I
3 : I could definitely
2 : You should give me your fire.
4 : Oh definitely
1 : You should use a Sandbag first though
3 : Oh yeah I can I will
2 : Ok
3 : Oh yeah you should use a Sandbag
1 : that way you don't have to throw it away
2 : On oh true
3 : On this one
3 : Cause that's the furthest away from all of us
2 : Can we use Temple of the Sun?
4 : Oh
4 : Oh
1 : Well maybe save this one then since it's closest to everyone
4 : That's true and
2 : But we can't we
2 : Can we save them if they're in this pile? Ok. Oh ok.
3 : Yeah, yeah as long as it's not a sinking tile
2 : Ok
2 : Good? Ok
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok now I will give you that with one action
2 : Ok
4 : Yay
4 : This is great.
2 : Perfect.
3 : Alright
3 : And then I can just fly over here and save this or shore that one up unless you guys care about these
2 : No I don't care about either of those really
4 : Ehh
3 : Three
4 : Yeah it's probably more important to save
4 : that one.
3 : Wait before I do that
3 : Oh yeah no that's mine
1 : Yeah that's fine
3 : Ok and then I'll shore
2 : And that's three
2 : Yeah ok
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : Don't forget this this time.
1 : We got a Water's Rising I'm sure.
3 : Alright and then I have to discard this guy.
2 : No
1 : Oh maybe not. Nice.
2 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : And then three
3 : Bronze Gate
3 : So over there
4 : Oh
2 : Ok
3 : Cave of Shadows
1 : Hmm
3 : Right here
4 : Sounds so ominous
3 : Dunes of Deception
1 : Yeah
3 : Over here
2 : Ok
4 : Ok
4 : You get to get this one
1 : Do you have to be on the tile first?
2 : You have to m-move is one of yours so that's one.
3 : You have to move yeah.
4 : Just kidding
4 : One
3 : And then you capture it yeah
4 : two
4 : Go it
4 : Uh and three
4 : Um we don't care about saving that one right?
3 : Um
2 : I mean shore it up since you're there
3 : But you can cause like
3 : It's just nice if it's at the top of the pile.
1 : It's a good stepping point.
4 : Yeah
3 : It's like a buffer.
4 : That's, that's a good point. What about that one since it's like
3 : Yeah sure.
4 : more centrally located.
2 : Yeah good. Alright good work.
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
1 : Alright
4 : And now two
4 : I also could have moved to that one so that we could share whoever oh well.
3 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
4 : And these things alright we've got
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Misty Marsh
4 : and Howling Garden
2 : Got it.
4 : and Cave of Embers.
2 : Alright perfect.
4 : Yeah
2 : Engineer
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
1 : So would it
3 : So we still want to save these two.
1 : Ok
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh yeah actually
1 : One
1 : two
3 : I mean you from where you are unless you're planning you can do all and you can do that one and that one, right
2 : You could save both.
1 : I could save either of them.
4 : You could save either.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : I can't cause I can't do diagonal.
3 : Oh wait you're diagonal sorry.
1 : But I can go up here and save those three.
2 : I would
4 : could save both or he-
2 : You could only do two at a time- oh two times.
4 : Oh
4 : Oh
1 : Yeah but I could do two and then one
3 : Oh right right.
4 : That's true.
3 : Yeah
2 : Do that
3 : I mean
3 : I think it's helpful
1 : Alright
1 : So I'll go there
1 : And then one
2 : That's three
1 : Ok
1 : Oh no
2 : Water's Rise
2 : Alright
3 : Wait we have to discard actually cause
1 : Yup Water's Rise
3 : We have- yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : So
4 : Oh
2 : Um
1 : Discard the
1 : duplicate maybe?
2 : Yeah I think it's o- we have three in play that's good.
3 : Yeah I think that makes sense.
4 : Cause you have two
3 : We have like a good amount
1 : Yup
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Alright so Water's Rise.
2 : I can shuffle these for you
1 : Good thing we just saved all those tiles.
2 : Ok
1 : One
1 : two
1 : Three
1 : Alright the Howling Garden is gone.
2 : Ok
1 : Cave of Embers is flipped, oh sorry. yeah
1 : And the Temple of the Moon.
2 : Ok
1 : Is flipped.
2 : Alright, so where am I at?
2 : Alright so I'm gonnna take
3 : So you want to cash these in right?
2 : Absolutely so I'm gonna have
2 : one move
3 : or
3 : maybe go to that one cause it's more centrally more centrally located
2 : Ok one move, two move
1 : Yeah you can swim
4 : You can
4 : do it when it's flooded right?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
4 : ok
2 : And then here's my third move. Whoo
4 : Yay
1 : Nice
4 : alright
3 : Alright
3 : Right here
2 : Then two cards
4 : So
4 : Big decision are we gonna do Chalice or?
4 : The other one, the Moon, Moon?
2 : Well oh that's good we only do have to use
1 : where are you, you're closer to me so Chalice
2 : One, two, three Cave of Shadows
1 : Maybe it makes more sense cause he can get you the card too by lifting out to you.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok Cave of Shadows is gone
2 : That doesn't count as a move I'm gonna swim
4 : Oh
4 : Swim
3 : Oh
2 : Dunes of Deception is gone and Cliffs of Abandon is flooded.
3 : Alright
4 : Ok
2 : Alrighty
1 : Alright
3 : Ok
3 : So
4 : Wait sorry, which one are we going for?
1 : A Chalice to me makes the most sense.
4 : Chalice ok
1 : Ssss
3 : Where are they?
3 : These are the only ones, this is the only one left?
1 : This is the Chalice yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Um
2 : We do have at least Te- both Temples of the Moon or Temp for the
1 : Although
1 : Yeah that's true
4 : That's true
4 : And
4 : Somebody's already on that one whose
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mm
4 : You are?
1 : Yeah
3 : I'm over here yeah but
4 : So
3 : so right now
4 : Mm
1 : So he can lift you, (do you have) no you don't have one
3 : What
4 : No I only have Chalices
1 : So that's me so he can lift
3 : Do you want to use
3 : Yeah I mean we could
4 : One, two, three, four, five. One, two three four.
3 : Um
3 : I could
1 : If you lift me
1 : to that tile.
3 : And then
1 : Then on my next turn I give you one, she can give you one and then we'll get it.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : you can share
2 : Yeah that's good. Let's do that.
4 : Oh perfect. Yeah.
1 : And then you just work on getting back to Fool's Landing.
2 : ok
3 : Wait
4 : Yeah
3 : But
3 : You want me to lift you there?
1 : Yeah if you
3 : For what reason?
4 : As w-
1 : So that
1 : ah
4 : He can share.
1 : So I can actually
1 : be there on my next turn.
2 : So you like you lift him there you give him, you give him one of your
1 : without wasting a Helicopter Lift.
3 : Oh I see.
2 : Your Moons.
1 : Although actually I suppose it
3 : Cause I could just
3 : like
3 : as a Pilot move to you
3 : and then give it to y- give you cards if you want them.
4 : But we need somebody to be on that one.
3 : Oh y- we need to be down here.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : That's
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : That way if it gets flooded you can shore it up on your turn.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
4 : And it's close to that thing.
3 : Sure
3 : So
1 : So you lift me down to the Temple of the Sun.
3 : Alright
3 : Which one are you, you're right here?
2 : The red
4 : Red
1 : Oh
1 : yeah
1 : Red
2 : And that doesn't count as one of your moves.
3 : No
4 : Oh right oh
2 : So you still have three
1 : Ok
4 : So you could share now.
3 : yeah I could give you like cause we can
3 : change them right? Or
1 : Yeah or so, actually we can get this on the next round. Uh if you give me a card
2 : You could use
3 : But then you're going to have to discard cards that's the only problem. Oh yeah
1 : Yeah I'll discard the Chalice.
2 : You could use- you could use two of your actions to give him both of your Moon cards.
1 : And then on her next turn
3 : So I
4 : Yeah cause we're done with the Chalice.
2 : Right now
1 : Oh that's true
4 : Oh and then he'd be ready to go on his turn
1 : Ok
2 : Yeah I would let's do that.
3 : Yeah
2 : Cause then we have at least
4 : Yeah I like that
3 : But then you're gonna have to discard both of the
1 : Yeah I can do that
2 : It doesn't matter but then we have three and we can all get to Fool's Landing and lift off.
4 : But yeah cause
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh we just need three. Ok so I'll just give you one
2 : We only need three out of four
1 : Yup
4 : Yeah
4 : Yup
4 : And then two
2 : And then that's two
3 : I'll give you the other
1 : Two ok I'll discard those two
3 : Then we'll discard
4 : Sweet
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
4 : Ok
3 : That's two actions for me?
2 : Mmhmm so you just have choose one more.
1 : Yup
3 : So I'll move over here.
3 : To get closer to Fool's Landing.
2 : Alright awesome perfect. Alright ooo
4 : Yeah I like it.
3 : Actually I'll pilot over there.
2 : There's those two for you.
4 : Oh so cool.
2 : And
2 : Then
2 : Perfect cool
3 : Bronze Gate
3 : That's gone
4 : Doesn't matter
3 : Misty Marsh
3 : Whispering Garden
2 : Ok
4 : Oh that's me
2 : Cool
3 : Your turn
4 : Oh and I'm just gonna move so I'm gonna go
2 : Mmhmm
4 : One
4 : Two three
2 : Good work
1 : Nice
4 : Ooo and then you can, and then I think we're gonna do it
2 : Yeah that's
3 : Wait
1 : Alright so Treasure Cards and Flood Cards
2 : Ooo yeah
4 : Oh yeah I have to do these things so excited
3 : First you're
3 : We have to keep playing the game.
4 : Alright, Chalice in a thing
4 : And then
4 : Ah Silver Gate
4 : is gone
2 : Yeah
4 : and
4 : Crimson Forest is flipped.
4 : Oh
4 : And Temple of the Sun
2 : Ok that's alright.
1 : Ok
2 : Alright
1 : So for the first one we're going to get the Earth Stone
1 : Where
1 : The Earth Stone
1 : K and then
3 : You just have to move there cause we can play this any time.
1 : I'm going to
1 : Go
1 : Well
2 : So that yeah that was one action
1 : You have that one right? So I can use
2 : But you still have two actions, so just move up and over.
1 : This
3 : Yeah it doesnt matter, like move there and there.
1 : Yeah that's true.
3 : And then we play Helicopter Lift and move out of King's
2 : Well hold on
3 : Fool's Landing
2 : Does he technically have to finish his turn before we can play that I guess? Alright, yeah play it.
3 : It says play any time.
4 : Oh
1 : Alright.
2 : then we Helicopter Lift off.
4 : Yay! We win!
2 : Whoo
4 : In twenty minutes.
2 : That's not bad. We did alright.
4 : That's fun.

1 : Ok so it's
1 : my turn first, so
1 : uh
1 : ok so
1 : I can move myself once I shore up a card
1 : Ok so I'm gonna
1 : shore up
1 : Whispering Garden, Lost Lagoon,
1 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : um
1 : Since I have two of the
1 : uh
1 : fire cards
1 : I'll
1 : probably try and
1 : yeah, move yeah, get, get over there, so I'll move there
2 : The closest one is here.
1 : and then
2 : you could shore up another two cards.
1 : uh
2 : Or can you only do that once per turn?
1 : Um that's a good question
2 : Well it did say- Does it give a condition?
3 : Shore up two
1 : two tiles, oh for one action, so yeah, so I think I can, yeah
2 : As one action
3 : tiles for one action.
2 : Yeah so shore those
3 : Yeah
2 : two up.
3 : There you go.
1 : Alright
1 : and then
3 : Alright
1 : I
1 : draw
1 : two treasure deck cards.
1 : K so we got
1 : the chalice and a Water's Rise card,
1 : so that means it moves up
1 : t- two and then
1 : draw two,
1 : or wait
2 : Yup,
2 : draw the- according to the water level which is now
1 : What're, what're, what are these?
2 : two.
2 : They- These were the ones that started flipped over.
1 : Should
1 : Oh ok, yeah, yeah, yeah, so I
1 : do that, so we got
2 : Oh shuffle,
1 : Oh yeah
2 : shuffle then.
1 : Ok so
1 : two cards.
1 : So Phantom Rock and
1 : Gold Gate
2 : So can you sink that?
2 : Mm
3 : Phantom Rock, uh sink it.
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok so
2 : (--)
1 : And then we remove that card, yeah.
2 : And then discard this
3 : it's out
3 : Ok
1 : And then Gold Gate, so we also remove Gold Gate.
3 : (--)
2 : Sink this
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : So
1 : So
2 : Now it's my turn
1 : Wait and
1 : I
1 : put this card in the
3 : (--)
1 : treasure
1 : discard pile.
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : Ok.
2 : Three actions, um
1 : Maybe
1 : So you're on Fool's Landing
2 : Oh
2 : really?
3 : Wait- I think I'm
2 : The gray, no
1 : Oh, wait, yeah different color, yeah, you're on Fool's Landing.
3 : I think I'm on Fool's Landing, yeah.
2 : Silver Gate.
2 : So
2 : I am near this and I have a card so I'm going to move
2 : one,
2 : oh
2 : also I have a this card.
2 : I'm gonna give this to you
2 : as one of my moves.
1 : Ok yeah
2 : It's two moves- actions and I'm going to uh
2 : move here
2 : for my third action
1 : Ok
2 : and now I'm drawing two treasure cards.
2 : Sandbags
2 : and the second one of these.
2 : Um shore up
2 : any one
2 : on the island and nothing's turned over.
1 : Nnhmm
2 : So
2 : yeah
2 : Um
1 : Ok
2 : and draw the flood cards.
2 : Um, Breaker's Bridge
1 : Mmhmm that's there
2 : and the Whispering Garden.
2 : It's your turn.
3 : Ok.
3 : Alright so uh (take up to) three actions, um
3 : I can
3 : um
2 : You might wanna save that cause we need one to get off the island.
3 : Yeah, yeah, you're right.
1 : And yeah, just for the end of the game and everything.
3 : So I'm
3 : close
3 : let's see, I've got one of these little cards right here.
3 : Um
2 : And you're two away from it.
3 : Yeah
3 : let's see.
3 : Alright
3 : I can't move (yeah)
2 : Or actually since you can fly anywhere
2 : or is that- that's your normal skill.
3 : Yeah I can fly
1 : Yeah, so he doesn't even have to use the Helicopter Lift.
2 : So maybe
2 : you should move close to
2 : you should move
2 : here
2 : so you can flip
2 : this one
3 : Mmhmm
2 : and then move over one and flip that
2 : too.
3 : So move here
3 : and flip it
3 : and move here
3 : and flip that.
2 : Yup.
3 : Ok,
3 : alright.
2 : That's three,
3 : Three actions
2 : move, flip
2 : Ah
3 : Uh ok so I say, I say um what- what two moves- uh that's right, that's two moves and I can only flip one
2 : Oh
2 : ok.
3 : Alright
3 : uh
3 : whoops, ok.
3 : Alright, so I've already done three actions so I also need to take two treasure deck cards.
3 : Uh
3 : two (--)
3 : treasure deck cards
3 : and
3 : These are the treasure deck cards and I need to take uh
3 : flood cards equal to the water level, that's
3 : two right?
1 : N-
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So, we got one and two
1 : Oh wait, we, we have to reshuffle these first
2 : Yeah
2 : Oh
3 : Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right, yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Uh and put them on the top or uh
1 : So
1 : wait
1 : or
2 : Yeah
2 : Oh, only Water's Rising
3 : Uh yeah, oh yeah
1 : Oh, only when there's a Water's Rising, or yeah
3 : Uh, uh, uh yeah so we got uh
3 : Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Ok, so Lost Lagoon
3 : and Cliffs of Abandon
3 : uh
1 : They're right here.
3 : Right there ok
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
3 : uh
2 : Now it's your turn
1 : Ok so, now it's my turn, um
1 : I'll use
1 : one action to
2 : Will it be smartest to flip
1 : Probably
1 : these, these two, yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Then um
2 : (--)
1 : Mm
1 : I think move to where
1 : the
1 : uh chalice is or where the fire crystal is. So yeah, the chalice is closer so yeah, I guess move.
2 : Oh
2 : chalice is right there.
3 : Chalice is (--)
3 : (--)
1 : One over and then uh I have one more move
1 : so I'll
1 : mm
1 : can, can, can I move
1 : twice?
2 : Yeah
3 : You've already done two
1 : Yeah, so one more move, like, one more move
2 : Mmhmm
3 : actions
2 : Yeah, would make sense
1 : to be my third action
2 : to move right here cause even if you got another card you could move right there.
1 : Yeah
1 : yeah, ok
1 : then two treasure deck cards. I'm gonna- Wait, I have to discard
2 : After you pull you can choose what you discard.
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok, so I'm gonna
1 : discard this one.
2 : Ok
2 : here
1 : Yeah, so treasure discard pile
2 : and now you pull two.
1 : Then two flood cards
1 : So Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate
3 : Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate
2 : Right h- Oh sun, Temple of the Sun
1 : Yeah
1 : Oh wait
3 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Temple of the Moon
3 : and the Iron Gate, right here
2 : Iron
2 : Gate
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : It's uh my turn
3 : (alright)
3 : Mmhmm
2 : and
2 : three actions.
2 : hm
2 : Well I'm going to um, flip this back over,
1 : Um
2 : is everybody
1 : Yeah
2 : (agree)
3 : ok
3 : Yeah
2 : and
2 : this doesn't count as an action, so I'm gonna play this
2 : and I need to flip something,
1 : Uh
2 : so
2 : I think it's
2 : useful to flip
2 : this one.
1 : Yeah, I mean I don't think it makes a huge difference either way, but it's
1 : probably better in the long run.
2 : Ok yeah. Oh that doesn't count so I still have two actions
1 : Then
2 : where I can
2 : give a treasure card
1 : Mm
2 : but
2 : or move
2 : so I'm gonna choose to move forward and move back
1 : Oh yeah
2 : and now pull two of these
2 : Oh
2 : and I have to play this.
1 : Water's Rise card
2 : Move the water level up one tick
1 : So now it's at three
2 : and shuffle these cards
2 : and discard this. And now it is
2 : your turn.
3 : Ok
1 : But we- You have to um do the three cards.
2 : Wait?
2 : Oh
2 : sorry
2 : Temple of the Moon,
1 : Ok, so Temple of the Moon gets flooded
2 : Breaker's Bridge,
1 : hmm
2 : which
2 : mm
3 : (--)
1 : Oh wait, it's this one.
2 : and the Lost Lagoon.
3 : Lost Lagoon,
3 : ok.
3 : Alright, so I've got uh
3 : Helicopter Lift- two Helicopter Lifts.
1 : You should give the fire card to me as one of them, because then I can get the fire card.
3 : Uh
3 : yup
3 : So
3 : does that
3 : count as one action?
2 : Yeah
2 : yup.
1 : Wait, wait, are- We have to make sure you can do that.
3 : Ok
2 : Um, is he next to you?
2 : Red and blue?
3 : Give- I can give a treasure card.
2 : Yup
3 : So
1 : Ok, yeah
1 : Wait, don't, don't we have to be on the same tile?
3 : Ok
2 : Oh, same tile
3 : Ok, ok
1 : Oh so you, so you should move-
2 : Move next to him
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah, you should use one move to move over to me.
3 : cool,
3 : alright.
1 : Then
3 : Then give you a treasure card, ok
1 : Yeah
1 : then
2 : And flip
3 : And then
2 : Breaker's
1 : One, two, three
1 : Wait, I have to discard one card
3 : Right
2 : Ok
1 : So
2 : chalice
3 : Get rid of that one
1 : probably, just yeah, discard the chalice.
2 : And you should flip
3 : (Right)
2 : Breaker's Bridge, since one- you're next to it.
3 : Ok
1 : Mmhmm
3 : And uh, then take two
2 : Oh
3 : treasure deck cards.
2 : Well, you know, these don't count as a move, so you can play one of them if you think it's strategic to move somewhere,
2 : right now.
3 : Ok
1 : Uh
1 : well
1 : you
1 : both of you guys have a statue of the wind card
1 : so-
2 : Oh, true
1 : Because you're all the way up here
1 : so if he flies up to you then
2 : Well I can give him a card at any time.
1 : Well, yeah you, yeah cause you're just the Messenger, yeah
2 : So on my next move I can give him this card, so it might be strategic for you to fly
1 : Yeah, to fly over to either Whispering Garden or the Howling Garden.
2 : next to-
3 : Ok
2 : Actually, well that's funny, that's right there. So um I would say he can move over and flip that so you should fly right here so
1 : Mmhmm
2 : on your next move you can flip Iron Gate
2 : and you can
2 : move to Howling Garden
2 : until you can discard that.
3 : Ok, now I have to take two treasure deck cards.
3 : Alright, yeah got to draw
3 : three flood cards.
1 : Yeah
1 : Here
3 : Ok
1 : So we've got Whispering Garden,
1 : Cliffs of Abandon, Iron Gate
3 : Iron Gate is gone
2 : Mm
3 : Whispering Garden
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : and what was the other one?
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Oh, Cliffs of Abandon right here, ok
1 : Yeah, right there.
3 : Ok
2 : And
2 : something else?
1 : And um
3 : Iron, Iron Gate is completely- it's off, submerged.
1 : Yeah and Whispering Garden, Cliffs of Abandon, Iron Gate, so we got all of them.
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok, so now it's my turn.
1 : So I'm gonna use one move to move down to Cave of Shadows
1 : and then since we have-
1 : we need four cards right
2 : Mmhmm
1 : so
1 : got the four fire cards
1 : and so
1 : just put them in the
1 : treasure discard pile, then
3 : Ok
1 : we
1 : have this
1 : I guess, (--)
1 : So, then um
1 : does that count as a move, capturing trea-? Yeah, tha-that counts as a move, yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Capture a treasure card, you moved, then you can do one more thing, can you shore up anything? Aw, you should've shored up before you moved.
1 : Eh, eh, eh, um
1 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : well
1 : Whoops
2 : Can't shore up anything now
2 : so
1 : I'll
2 : you can
2 : move
2 : next to something
2 : like right here
1 : Yeah, and then next round I can shore up Cliffs of Abandon, Whispering Garden
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : you may
2 : capture a treasure and a flooded tile
1 : Wait, when you capture a (treaure)
2 : Win your treasure gem, discard the treasure pile and move the figure in front of you.
1 : M, Move the figurine in front of you.
2 : Oh ok
2 : Iron Gate
2 : Oh, discard this
1 : Oh yeah, we have to, yeah
3 : Ah, ok
1 : Get that outta there
2 : Oh and did we uh
2 : discard
2 : something?
2 : No?
2 : Ok
1 : Ok, yeah
1 : so
1 : then, two treasure cards
1 : so that and that
1 : then
1 : flood cards.
1 : So Howling Garden, Crimson Forest, and Copper Gate.
2 : Ok, Howling Garden,
1 : Crimson Forest,
2 : Crimson Forest,
2 : Copper Gate
1 : Copper Gate.
2 : So, our most
2 : important
2 : cards to flip over are the ones that have special things on them.
2 : Um
2 : now's my turn
2 : so I'm going to
2 : flip-
2 : to shore up
2 : this tile
2 : and
2 : move
1 : Uh
2 : I was thinking move here
2 : shore up,
2 : shore up this tile.
1 : Y-
1 : Well
1 : yeah, you should definitely stay around here because then we both have one of the-
1 : these cards, so we can give- Ah wait, but we've gotta be um
2 : Yeah
2 : Well, I can give you a card
2 : anywhere.
2 : Um
2 : Ya'll can only give me a card if you're next to me.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : The other tile for this is right here, so maybe, perhaps I should give you
2 : um
2 : well that's funny, you have two of those. But if I gave you one of these cards
2 : or I could-
2 : I think it's important to shore up the
2 : Copper Gate-
2 : Gate card, but I could give you one of my cards and on my next turn give you another cards, and he has one card.
2 : Ya'll are next to each other.
1 : So we- Yeah, and so I just stay down here to capture this down here, yeah.
2 : He can give you a card.
2 : Yeah
2 : Yup
2 : So
1 : Ok yeah, let's do that
2 : I'm gonna move here
2 : Wait, now that we have three turns, if I moved,
2 : I flipped this, I shored up
1 : Yeah, so that's one turn,
2 : I can move here
1 : two turn
2 : and shore up
2 : or I could um
2 : I think I should shore up, because we're pulling three everytime.
2 : What do you think, is it more important to give you one of these?
3 : Shore up
2 : Oh no, because I'm already here, so it doesn't matter, so
1 : I, I
1 : yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : yeah
2 : Cause he can always fly to me and give me that.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So I'm gonna move here and shore up here
2 : and then
2 : pull two of these.
1 : Yeah (cause definitely), you'll get one of those cards
1 : when you pull from the treasure deck.
2 : Ok
2 : and a water rising,
2 : so
1 : So then we have to reshuffle all of these
2 : Yup
1 : Mm and then
1 : draw three.
2 : This is Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : So
2 : oh cities of Abandon.
1 : Copper Gate,
2 : No Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : This sinks
1 : Ok, so yeah, Cliffs of Abandon is gone.
1 : So we gotta put that there too
2 : And Temple of the Moon
1 : up here.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Alright
2 : So
1 : Ok
2 : now it is your turn
3 : Ok
2 : and you should definitely use the sandbags to save
2 : one of these tiles with a um-
2 : oh,
2 : Discard water's rise? Ok
1 : Yeah, so you should, you should definitely use sandbags for like Temple of the Moon.
3 : Ok
3 : so sandbags, Temple of the Moon and
2 : And you
2 : could,
3 : um
2 : you could fly over
2 : to me
2 : um
2 : and give me one of these cards.
3 : I could- Yeah I could give you one of these, yeah, that was what I was thinking.
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, that's a good call.
3 : Uh
2 : Wait,
2 : wait, where are you?
3 : I'm over, I'm over here.
1 : He's all the way
2 : Here
1 : Yeah, he's all the way down there.
2 : He should sh-
3 : So you're
1 : Shore up Howling- Yeah, cause Whispering Garden's also s-
2 : Shore up Howling- Yeah, yeah
1 : flooded too.
2 : Shore up this up
2 : first.
3 : Wait a minute
2 : You're here.
1 : So sandbags doesn't count as a move
3 : Ok, that, that's good, that's good, that's what I've been getting confused about
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : So, ok so, I'm right here and then
2 : Shore this card
3 : Shore up this,
1 : Shore up How- Howling Garden, yeah
3 : ok
2 : What move is that? Number one or number two?
1 : That's one, because sandbags doesn't count as a move.
2 : Ah
2 : ok
3 : Ok
3 : So, that's one
3 : And then
1 : Then
1 : fly over to
2 : I think you should fly here cause on your next turn you could shore this up
1 : Yeah
2 : and then
3 : So if, if I, if I m-
2 : actually
3 : turn this over, do I have to move here?
1 : No.
2 : no, no, no.
3 : Ok, ok.
2 : Wait, do you have to be near me to give me a card, or on the same- You have to be on the same-
3 : Has to be on the same-
2 : So you should fly here.
1 : Yeah, fly to Crimson Garden
3 : Yeah,
3 : right
2 : Second move and give me a card for your third move
3 : Ok
1 : Third move
3 : Ok, great.
2 : So I have five cards now.
2 : Ok
3 : And then I have to- Don't I have to pull two cards, ok, yeah. And I also have to take
1 : Yeah, you pull two, yup
2 : Yup
3 : Wait, I have to pull
3 : treasure deck
3 : and I've gotta
3 : pull two of those flood cards. Ok, so I got this and this one
3 : and
1 : Three flood cards, yeah.
3 : three flood cards, ok.
2 : Oh, oh and then we don't shuffle, ok.
2 : So one,
2 : two, three.
3 : Ok, so-
3 : oh wait, there are- these were four, uh I'll just
2 : Oh
3 : put
3 : The-
3 : What should I put, the top one back or the bottom one?
2 : Bottom one.
3 : Bottom one? Ok
1 : Yeah, bottom one.
3 : Ok, um so then that would be uh Lost Lagoon, Whispering Garden
2 : oh
1 : So, Lost Lagoon,
2 : Whispering Garden
3 : is out.
1 : Whispering Garden
3 : Ok, Howling Garden.
1 : Howling Garden.
3 : Ok.
2 : No
1 : Ok
2 : um
2 : those go here
3 : Oh, yeah, that's right, those go right here, so
1 : Well
3 : Th-
1 : um
1 : l
2 : Well Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden
1 : Lost Lagoon and Whispering Garden yeah go in there.
3 : Whispering Garden, yeah
2 : Ok
1 : So we also have to
3 : yeah
1 : make sure we
1 : take care of that one, because if that goes under, that's bad.
3 : Right
2 : Ok so now it's your turn.
3 : Mm
3 : (--)
1 : Ok so
1 : um
2 : You have the chalices but
2 : right now it's strategic to flip things over
2 : so you- Cause we can always take care of these on our turns, so you should flip this one over.
1 : Yeah
1 : yeah so I sh-
1 : If I move one, two
1 : then I can shore this up, yeah
2 : You can flip
2 : Yup
1 : Do you think that's the right call?
2 : Or if you move one, two
1 : Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's the same end result.
2 : Yup
1 : One,
1 : two, that's
1 : two moves,
1 : flip this one over.
1 : Ok
1 : so those are my three moves
1 : then
2 : And now you pull two.
1 : Yeah
1 : Oh perfect
2 : Oh
1 : And then we got the two chalice cards
2 : and go back there
3 : Perfect, ok
3 : good.
1 : Yeah
1 : and then
1 : three flood cards.
1 : So
1 : Cave of Embers, Crimson Forest, and Breaker's Bridge.
1 : So
1 : Crimson Forest is out,
2 : Is out
2 : and we're both flooding, I mean we're swimming
3 : We're stranded right now.
2 : so we're gonna move on our turns to one.
1 : Cave of Embers,
1 : flooded.
2 : And Breaker's Bridge
1 : Breaker's Bridge
2 : Crimson Forest is out
2 : Ok
2 : Um
2 : and now it's my turn.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So, I'm going to swim-
2 : Well no, I need to s-
2 : We need to swim to the same card, so that you can give- still give me a card. So I'm gonna swim-
3 : Temple of the Moon
2 : Temple of the Moon,
2 : um that's not a move.
1 : Nnmm
3 : I would shore up
2 : Oh
3 : Copper Gate, wouldn't you?
2 : Can we do that while we're swimming?
2 : Can I undo that?
1 : I don't think so.
2 : No
2 : ok.
1 : You can make another move
1 : down here
1 : because that, that didn't count as a move. So you can move one down here, shore that up,
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
1 : then
2 : Should I be giving any cards to anybody, no? So move down
1 : No, I don't think you have to.
2 : and shore up.
1 : Wait, actually
1 : what if
1 : as a move, you gave him the statue of wind card, cause he already has two, and then he can fly down there
1 : cause then he just needs one more.
2 : Statue of the wind card?
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Because we just need three treasures and we've got the chalices right here.
2 : Well now I move so should I shore up or should I give him the statue of the wind? I can always give it to him
2 : any time
2 : on my next turn, after he flies down,
2 : like
2 : so if I shore this up now-
1 : Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that- Yeah.
2 : So shore up-
2 : um, I'll give it to him on my next turn.
1 : Ok, yeah
2 : And
2 : pick two of these.
2 : I got a chalice
2 : and I got one of these,
2 : so I will-
2 : I can't have more than five.
1 : Probably discard the
1 : fire card.
3 : Yeah, discard the fire card.
1 : Yeah, cause we already got that.
2 : Two, that's still five, so I have to discard this as well.
1 : Yeah, I mean we don't need that either.
2 : Ok
2 : and
2 : oh yeah, on my next turn I can give him both.
1 : Yup
2 : Ok, so I have to pull th- Well, no we don't have to shuffle. Pull three of these.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : So, Silver Gate,
2 : Dunes of Deception,
2 : and
2 : Coral Palace.
1 : Oh
1 : uh so Coral Palace,
2 : Dunes of Deception and Silver Gate, it's right there.
1 : Silver Gate
1 : k
3 : Ok
3 : So, my turn?
2 : Yes
1 : Yup
3 : Ok
3 : um
3 : I've got
3 : two of these
2 : Two specials
2 : You're gonna hold on to those, cause I'm gonna give you these two on my next move.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok, ok
1 : I think you should shore up coral palace
1 : like (fly over it)
2 : S
1 : and shore up
2 : Well first you get to swim anywhere
3 : I gotta go swim, (I gotta) I should swim probably to Copper
2 : You have to swim 'em
1 : Oh yeah
3 : Gate.
1 : Yup
2 : Yeah
2 : And then
3 : And then I can shore up
2 : you should fly somewhere so you can shore up
1 : Yeah
3 : That's right, fly
3 : to
2 : Well no, use your special to fly, since you have two,
3 : uh
3 : R-
3 : Right
2 : and it won't count as a move, so you're at one move.
3 : Ok, one move so far.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Uh
1 : Wait no, you're not even at one move so far because swimming somewhere doesn't count.
2 : Oh, that doesn't count!
3 : Oh ok, ok, so I've got (uh) nothing.
2 : So
1 : Yeah
2 : use a special to fly
3 : Ok
2 : right here.
3 : Ok
2 : You can shore up
1 : Shore up Breaker's Bridge
3 : Shore up is
2 : Well, shore up is one move.
3 : K.
1 : Then, move over to Coral Palace.
2 : No he doesn't have to move to shore up, he can shore up here and here as his three moves.
1 : or
1 : Oh yeah, cause he's just, yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : That's
3 : uh
3 : ok, two
2 : uh huh

3 : Ok, alright.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok so now it's my turn, so I'm gonna m-
2 : Wait a minute, let's stategize before we move, so
2 : Your
2 : priority is to move so you can
2 : get
1 : Yeah
1 : right here, Coral Palace.
2 : Oh
1 : So
2 : Ok
1 : I was just saying, move one,
1 : two,
1 : two moves.
2 : Let's fl- Oh, cause you need the third to trade it in. Ok, that makes sense.
1 : Yeah
1 : so one,
1 : two,
1 : then,
1 : then
1 : put then treasure discard pile.
3 : Ok
1 : capture that,
1 : It's my move
1 : two treasure cards now.

1 : So Silver Gate
1 : is gone
2 : Wait, but you are- Were you supposed to pull, it just says shuffle it,
1 : Hmm?

1 : Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Alright, so those are gone, Cave of Embers, also gone
2 : Ok
1 : Then Tidal Palace also gone.
1 : Well we got all those
1 : cards already, so it doesn't matter.
2 : So
2 : strategically, we want him
2 : to fly over
2 : to here on his next move,
2 : and
2 : my biggest priority is to give him these two
1 : Yeah
2 : so that's gonna be
3 : mmhmm
2 : two of my moves
1 : Yup
2 : um,
2 : so two moves, I'm giving these to you

2 : Ok
1 : So for
1 : my
2 : Well you can turn two over for kicks.
1 : Yeah, I'll just turn
1 : this one over

1 : then
1 : m-move over here
2 : And
3 : Ok

2 : Oh
3 : left.
1 : then I'll
2 : You can give me a card, give me that card.
1 : I'll- Yeah I'll give you this card,
1 : then you just discard one of the cards.
2 : Ok
1 : Then just two treasure cards- Oh wait
1 : Oh, she was on the same island as me, that's right.
2 : Oh, true
3 : Ok
2 : So I
2 : can't, you can't give me that card. Is there anybody on your land?
2 : No, Fool's Landing
1 : Um
2 : You can
2 : m- that's funny.
2 : You have two fly anywheres.
2 : Um
2 : well
2 : if you fly to me
2 : and on his next move
2 : he flies to me,
2 : right?
2 : So you fly to me
1 : Ok
2 : I do some stuff,
2 : um
2 : but we stay on the same card, he can fly to us, then fly us all back.
2 : He can fly to us with his one move right? And then he can use the card
1 : Oh yeah, cause he can use his-
1 : But we need a move- We need a Helicopter Lift to get off the island.
2 : Uh, true
2 : Uh
1 : Um
1 : crap.
2 : Uh
2 : well you can just move
2 : one card over to a safe
1 : Ok, yeah
1 : just for time's sake, yeah. Ok so those are my three moves so
2 : Ok
1 : Two treasure cards
1 : Ok so
1 : those then
1 : three flood cards.
1 : So Temple of the Sun, Bronze Gate,
1 : and Misty Marsh
1 : so
1 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Bronze Gate,
3 : Alright
1 : Bronze Gate
3 : Two thirty five.
1 : And Misty Marsh.
2 : Misty Marsh
1 : (ok yeah so that just goes there)
2 : Ok, so now it's my turn, where I make three moves
2 : I'm right there
2 : I need to make
2 : two more moves to get here, so one move can be to flip
1 : Yeah
2 : this over
1 : Yup
3 : oh
2 : one, two
1 : Alright, so yeah, that was your three.
2 : Three moves
3 : Alright
2 : Water's Rising and one of these.
1 : Ok, so we're at four now
1 : for
2 : Yup
3 : Ok
2 : oh.
2 : Water's Rising, so move the water level, you did that. Shuffle the card
3 : Alright, quick shuffle, two minutes, two minutes.
2 : Hmm
1 : We only have two minutes left.
2 : Oh, ok
3 : Yup
2 : Put it down and I pull four. Misty Marsh, flip that
2 : or move that. Howling Gardens,
2 : remove this.
2 : Copper Gate, flip it.
2 : And Breaker's Bridge
2 : Ok, and now that's the end of my turn, now it's your turn.
3 : Alright so
2 : So strategically
3 : I guess
2 : wait,
2 : you can fly
2 : you can um
1 : Like you just go one, two, three, and still wind up on Fool's Landing.
2 : Or he can fly to you
2 : Oh no,
2 : yeah he can wait (wait a minute)
2 : If he flies to you
2 : on his next move, he can play this card
2 : and he can
2 : pick you up and f-
1 : Well, here, we, we only have a minute, like cause I have a Helicopter Lift, so I can- If he just goes one, two
3 : So I (--) one
3 : two, three, there we go.
1 : three.
1 : Yeah, and then two treasure cards.
3 : Ok, ok
2 : Ok
3 : Alright
1 : Cause I have a Helicopter Lift card too so I can use that to get us off the island, so
3 : alright
3 : and we've got
1 : Coral Palace, Dunes of Deception, Temple of the Moon,
3 : two
3 : Dunes of Deception is done, Dunes of Deception is done.
1 : And Watchtower.
2 : Hmm
3 : Temple of the Moon
3 : is done
1 : Dunes of- Oh, Watchtower.
3 : Dunes of, Dunes of Deception, Temple of the Moon,
1 : Mm
1 : ok.
1 : This is
3 : Both done, we need, I need- Yeah, Coral Palace.
1 : And Coral Palace
1 : Ok, so my turn
3 : We need-
3 : yeah
1 : So
1 : gonna
2 : You wanna end up on that card
3 : Yup
3 : yup.
1 : So
2 : So flip that,
1 : One
3 : One
1 : uh
1 : no
2 : If you move over, you can give me a card
1 : two,
3 : two,
1 : mm
1 : then
2 : Oh, actually you can just fly us all out
3 : Ten seconds.
1 : Yeah
1 : In, then- Fly, fly us out? Yeah fly out.
2 : Fly out? Yeah.
3 : Yup
1 : Ok
2 : Ok
3 : Done.

1 : Ok
4 : Alright
1 : So, our strategy, I think, should be-
1 : Make sure this is-
1 : Never flooded. Like that sh-
4 : Right
1 : Especially for you, if you can fly there and get there.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Um
1 : And also, whoever has-
1 : Lke, see how I have two? If you have one, that should be one of your actions would be like to get the person with the most-
1 : Then, once we have-
1 : Like, one of the treasures-
1 : I don't think we need to care about-
2 : Yeah, 'cause I was gonna say you should move there first to-
4 : Unsink it
2 : Flip it over.
1 : Yeah
2 : Shore it up.
1 : Ok
4 : And then shore up-
2 : Mmhmm
4 : (And) you can do two, right?
1 : I'll do these
1 : So that's-
1 : Two-
1 : (My) second action
2 : Right, that counts as one
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And-
1 : And
1 : I'll just start moving closer to this one so I can get the chalice
1 : Ok
1 : So two-
1 : (Now) take up to three, that (wasn't)-
2 : Alright, go back.
1 : Oh
2 : 'Cause you moved, flipped it up, that's two. Yeah
1 : I guess I moved there, then I shored it up-
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Got it.
1 : Right.
1 : Ok
4 : Put that up one
1 : Move the water level-
1 : Shuffle-
1 : Oh
4 : You have to shuffle all these and put 'em on top
1 : There's already ones in there?
2 : And discard that-
2 : First
2 : And then draw two
1 : Ok
2 : Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : And we already lost a tile
4 : At least-
1 : That's- that's a- that's a meaningless tiles anyways
2 : So that gets discarded and Lost Lagoon also gets-
3 : Hmm, hmm, mmhmm
4 : And discard that
1 : Ok
4 : And then-
2 : Now it's my turn?
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Um
2 : I will-
2 : Move here-
2 : (--) I can move again, I guess, and then flip it.
4 : Is that like one-
4 : You have- you can move two places
4 : Or just-
2 : I guess that's two moves
3 : Mm
4 : Oh, ok.
2 : Will that be my three?
2 : Sandbags
2 : And-
4 : Should we use the sandbags right away?
1 : I think we should keep 'em
2 : Yeah, 'cause we're good right now
2 : Draw two flood cards
3 : (--)
4 : Only if you get a water rise
2 : (Do I-)
2 : Good
2 : Phantom Rock and Breaker's Bridge
1 : No
3 : So this is goin', right?
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, what was that? That's-
1 : Phantom's Rock
3 : Phantom Rock, doesn't mean anything anyway
2 : (And) Breaker's Bridge
1 : NnMm
3 : Alright
4 : Um
3 : Where should I fly?
1 : Um
2 : Gold Gate?
1 : Yeah
1 : (I'd) pick that one.
3 : Why?
2 : I don't (know)
1 : Just 'cause it's-
4 : Why not fly there? Because if we get a waters tise card- I mean it's not an important tile but-
4 : If we keep losing all the tiles-
3 : Yeah, that m-
2 : Yeah
3 : We lose this, it doesn't mean anything
4 : And like we have-
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah
3 : So fly here?
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Shore that up-
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Then I have- I have one more
1 : Oh
4 : Uh, it doesn't make sense to give anyone-
1 : No
3 : Mm I'll just keep it
1 : NnMm
3 : (If) I can only do two actions, right?
3 : Mm
2 : Yeah, unless you want to move again. That's be another ac-
1 : Mmhmm
4 : You just can't fly again. You can just move a space
3 : Hmm I think I'll stay there
3 : I'm- sh- and I'm gonna save this. Should I keep this, just in case? Ok, so-
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Mm
4 : Mmhmm
1 : (Probably) need it
4 : You pick
3 : I draw two of these
3 : Alright, well now I have two
3 : Then-
3 : Draw two of those
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Golden Gate-
1 : Mm
3 : Um
3 : Temple of the Moon
3 : Flip that one back.
3 : This one
4 : Ok
4 : So
4 : I can-
2 : You can go diagonal and then give me your lion card-
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh that's a good idea
4 : Oh good call
1 : You can only give it somebody you're on the tile with
1 : Ok
4 : Uh, that's yours, right? Ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Hmm, that's two
4 : And then-
3 : You could sh- shore up that one
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh
4 : This one?
2 : Yeah, 'cause you're next to it
1 : Nice
4 : Alright. That was three right?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mm
3 : Mm
4 : And can I have two flood cards?
4 : Whispering Garden and Iron Gate
4 : (Garden)
1 : Ok
1 : Hmm
1 : Any ideas?
4 : Move one and shore
4 : Oh wait, that's not-
1 : Are only allowed to give one treasure card?
1 : Like-
1 : If I went here, could I just give both of these to you- no, I guess that would be a waste of time
2 : No, I guess
2 : Yeah, you would only give one card per-
1 : Yeah
1 : Mm
1 : Can I-
2 : (--)
3 : I would move one, two, and shore that up. 'Cause next is adjacent to you. That way you're still close to them if you need to be
1 : Eh
1 : Ok
2 : But can't Messenger- Explorer only-
3 : Be your one, two-
4 : Moves
3 : That's one move, that's two moves, that third action would be to sh- shore the-
2 : But can't the Messenger only- I mean. Explorer only-
2 : Shore it up if they're next to it?
1 : Can move or shore up diagonally
1 : We can all do adjacent.
4 : Can't we all shore-
2 : Oh, oh. Ok, ok, ok.
3 : Well she- if it's adjacent, yeah
4 : Are you going to shore that up?
1 : So
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright
2 : Good
1 : Two
1 : Oh my ga-
1 : 'k
1 : So try to keep in mind whichever ones were recently flooded, I guess.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : (Well we) unflooded Iron Gate. It doesn't mean anything
1 : Ok
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Iron Gate
1 : Whispering Garden. Oh my goodness-
1 : Alright, so we wanna make sure- I think these ones are the most important.
1 : No matter what
1 : Eh-
2 : But there's another one
1 : Yeah
3 : Hmm
4 : Ok
1 : Is that everything I have to do?
3 : Mm I think- I think we're good
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
2 : So, I guess the first thing I'll do-
2 : Is shore up-
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
2 : And then-
4 : Mean you can move one and shore up that but-
2 : Yeah
1 : 'k
4 : You're gonna have to discard something
2 : Oh, you're- you're right. One, two, three-
2 : (Four), five
2 : Well, I'll discard a sandbags
2 : Right? Should I do that?
3 : (Mm) do you have to use it?
4 : Can you use it?
3 : Do you have to use it?
1 : Can you use both sandbags?
4 : We don't even have anything flipped over to use it on
1 : Can- can they just rest on there?
3 : (Perhaps we could)- or do you have to use it to discard it?
4 : No, like if she has five she c-
2 : I don't think so. 'Cause it's kinda like I have to discard one of them
4 : Well I think you s- even if you discard that you still have six
4 : Don't you have four of those?
2 : Four, five six
1 : Wait, do you have four of these?
2 : Yeah
1 : Why didn't we get him?
4 : 'Cause she just picked it
3 : (--)
1 : Oh, you just picked it
4 : But, I would just discard-
4 : One of the sandbags and either the other sandbag or the-
3 : Mm uh, I would get rid of the fire thing
1 : Yeah, I think the fire thing is the-
2 : Ok
3 : Do you want me to just get rid of it?
2 : Yeah
1 : So sad
4 : Well she can hopefully move there next time
2 : One, two, three
3 : Ok, (--) I can do flood cards
1 : (--)
4 : Flood cards
1 : You need three now
2 : Breaker's Bridge, Temple of the Moon-
2 : And Temple of the Sun.
1 : Breaker's Bridge, where is it?
4 : I don't (--)
4 : Just kidding
1 : Ok
4 : Alright
4 : So
2 : Pilot, you're up
4 : I think that you-
1 : Think you co-
1 : Giver her one of those?
4 : I think he should give you this one
1 : Oh, yeah. 'Cause then I'll definitely-
4 : But, is he near you
1 : Can you fly me?
1 : 'Cause then-
1 : If you, mm, yeah-
3 : Right, I have two of these helicopter lift things
1 : So, maybe if you give me the chalice-
4 : Does he have to be on the same-
2 : Yeah, only I can give a card if I'm not-
1 : You're right
4 : (What)
1 : Mm
2 : I think you should-
3 : (--) I could- I could fly here-
3 : Give her the chalice
1 : And then fly me over there?
4 : But that doesn't count as a move so maybe you should-
4 : Flip this, Temple of the Moon
2 : I think you need to flip that one 'cause both of those are-
3 : Mm
1 : Good call
2 : Flipped over
3 : So, flip this-
4 : So, shore up that one-
4 : Give- fly- er, yeah. Fly yourself to where she is
3 : Fly myself here
3 : That's two
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
4 : And give her a card, which is three. And the helicopter lift card doesn't count as a move so you can still fly whoever's on here
3 : Right, I can use this at anytime, correct? I can use it, like, during your turn
1 : Mmhmm. So, I guess it can wait
3 : Yeah, just- just in case
1 : It's not, yeah
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Mmhmm
1 : (In) case something gets flooded-
4 : Ok
3 : So, wait
3 : Are (you --) I'm- I'm good then?
1 : Yeah, you just need the-
2 : Yeah, and then just three of these
3 : But I (didn't)- I (didn't)-
3 : Three actions, right? Yeah, ok.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah, (you) have to pick two of those first
3 : (--)
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh
2 : Ok
2 : That's that
3 : We can start- we can start discarding these, too, once we get- 'cause we have four
1 : Mm 'k
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, that's a good call
3 : Ok, so can- can you hand me three water cards?
1 : Oh, and she already does have this
2 : Yeah
3 : Um
1 : So you could fly her at anytime there
1 : Fly me at anytime there, just to get it
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh, yeah
3 : Do- but don't we need one of these to leave the game? So I should keep one, just in case, if we don't get another one
1 : Yeah
2 : Well yeah, my next move I'll be moving over there anyway so-
3 : Yeah
1 : So, I guess, yeah
3 : (So I-)
4 : So it's a good idea not to move the whole-
3 : (--)
3 : Hmm
3 : ('Cause)
4 : Crimson Forest-
3 : Hmm
4 : Copper Gate
2 : And what was it? Tidal-
3 : It's gonna (--)
4 : Alright
3 : Sh-
1 : Now fly me to it
2 : Mmhmm
3 : (That) doesn't sink
4 : I will-
3 : Most (--)
2 : And there's this one
1 : (--)
1 : Oh, yeah you need to come (--)
4 : I need to come on with you, one-
1 : So you can give her that
4 : Two-
4 : If I move over here I can still shore that one up
2 : Mmhmm
3 : (--) you already- you already moved one
1 : Oh
4 : No
1 : One, two-
4 : Oh, should I shore this one up?
3 : Two
3 : I would move there and shore it up
1 : Mm
4 : Move there?
3 : Wait, no 'cause- does that count as a-
4 : Oh, yeah, it will count
1 : Wait, can't you just shore it up?
3 : (--)
3 : (Yeah), just shore it up then
3 : Well 'cause you'd be closer for next turn but I would just do that
4 : Oh
4 : Oh crap
3 : At least we're still at three
4 : Ok, can you shuffle the-
2 : Oh, yeah
3 : Give me that card
1 : Yeah, at least we are still at three
1 : But-
1 : This could-
4 : Kill our-
4 : I don't know
1 : Our plan. Well, he can always deliver me there
4 : Deliver you
1 : And then we don't have to worry about it
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Temple of the Sun, Copper Gate, Whispering Garden
1 : Temple of the Moon
2 : Temple of the-
4 : Temple of the Sun
2 : Temple of the Sun's gone
3 : So you- hand me that
4 : I flipped- and then Copper Gate, the one-
1 : Wh- which one is it?
2 : It was a chalice one- no earth one
3 : Mm er- er- mm, earth
4 : But now-
4 : You can m-
1 : Ok, so
4 : You can just move there, though
4 : Don't you-
1 : I can't like, go there that fast
4 : Oh, you can't move diagonally
1 : Yeah. Do you want to fly me now?
3 : Mm wait
4 : Can you use that, like, in the middle of your turn?
3 : Uh can you (give me the) time?
3 : (--) play (at) anytime
1 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
1 : No
1 : Uh
2 : No?
2 : Guess not
1 : May only have five cards
1 : Oh, that's me!
4 : That is you
4 : Um
3 : Discard
3 : Ooo
4 : The-
4 : Fire
2 : The fire
3 : Yeah
4 : But now-
1 : (--)
4 : Can you fly-
1 : I think you still should fly me there.
4 : (Does) that work?
3 : I'm trying to think if we get- we get three actions, right?
1 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So if you-
4 : But she can't move diagonally
3 : Then, uh, so-
1 : Does that count as my action?
3 : Yeah, (you're) collecting the treasure so I- I have to fly you. I'm trying to think of another way you could do it but you- you can't.
1 : Oh, yeah, no
1 : I think I should be flown
3 : Ok, so I'll fly you there
3 : (We'll) discard this
4 : Do you just fly?
3 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile
4 : One person
1 : So does anybody else want to come with me?
2 : No, gotta- I gotta stay by Whispering Garden
1 : Yeah, you have to stay there.
4 : That does-
1 : But-
1 : Alright, any of you close? You're kinda close to that-
1 : (--)
3 : We have a lot of tiles. We should all stay close 'cause these are all (--) part
1 : Yeah
1 : Alright
2 : Should you-
4 : Just fly
2 : Um
2 : Flood up-
2 : Whispering Garden in case you pull-
1 : Like both of them first-
1 : And then fly there?
2 : Yeah, in case you pull a-
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok, 'cause I can do two.
2 : Water rising
2 : Yeah
4 : That counts as one turn?
3 : (--)
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah, one action-
3 : (--) two actions
3 : This doesn't count so you're (--) here
1 : S-
1 : Wait that was-
3 : (When)
1 : This si just one action
4 : For her, she can do two
3 : Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : So, now I'm here
2 : And then when you collect that-
2 : That's an action.
4 : Right
1 : Oh it is? Ok, so-
2 : Mm
1 : One action-
1 : Did that count as an action? Ok
3 : No
2 : No, but when you collect this chalice-
2 : It'll be- that's an action
1 : Now what do I do with the cards?
3 : (--)
4 : Discar-
4 : I think you-
3 : (--) (just discard the-)
1 : (--)
1 : Just-
3 : (--) you-
4 : And now we just have-
3 : You have one left
1 : (--)
1 : Yay, ok
3 : (Why don't you just) flip that?
4 : Yeah
1 : (It's) pretty good
3 : Mmhmm
4 : That was good
1 : We got one
4 : Alright
4 : Now you can pick-
1 : Two
1 : Woohoo! Look at that
1 : 'k
4 : Three
1 : Ok, Crimson Forest-
3 : (--)
1 : (Was) that a-
3 : (--)
1 : Special one?
3 : No
1 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : That's a central tile
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Oh
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah, we gotta keep that one
2 : That one's our last one-
2 : of the earth, so-
1 : Oh no
2 : That's important
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : So-
2 : So I'm gonna-
2 : Move, collect. That's two
1 : And then-
3 : Mm I-
1 : I can f-
2 : Or, no. Should I flip-
3 : Uh
2 : Should I flood this up-
2 : First and then move, collect?
3 : If you can do all three
1 : Well, I could fly her
2 : Should I do that?
3 : You sh- y- y- y- you need keep- you need to keep this one.
4 : Right, so if she moves there-
1 : So if you move-
4 : Flip-
4 : A f- uh-
3 : (--)
3 : Move he- move here, collect-
4 : Shored up that one-
3 : Fly her there and then shore up
3 : That would be three.
1 : Yeah
2 : Do that?
4 : 'k
3 : So
3 : Move there
1 : Hmm
4 : Collect
3 : Collect
1 : Nice
3 : That's two
3 : Then fl- can you use your-
2 : And then fly me-
4 : Fly her-
1 : Ok
3 : There
4 : To the Temple of Moon
3 : Shore that up
4 : Shore it up
4 : That's three.
1 : Ok
2 : And then- right
3 : Mm
2 : Fires
1 : Good
3 : That's good, yeah
4 : ('Cause) now we keep getting rid of those
2 : And three of these
2 : Silver Gate
2 : Tidal Palace
2 : And Breaker's Bridge
1 : I need to get off of that guy
3 : Breaker's (--) this is the-
2 : Breaker's Bridge
4 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : So
4 : I think you should give-
4 : Me or her-
4 : The Engineer, this card
1 : Who's closest to that-
1 : Piece? You are.
4 : Me
1 : So-
1 : And she could just, in one move-
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Just go bam.
1 : So I think you should give her one of the-
4 : But I only have two
3 : We have to wait a whole t- 'til it comes around again 'cause you only have-
3 : Three of them, she needs four.
4 : Yeah
1 : Oh, you're right
3 : So it would make sense trying to get- we should try to get you- us to try to get you closest to that
4 : One of them
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Does anybody have a flight card, though?
3 : I do, but I don't know if we're gon- gonna get one again
4 : Um
1 : Um
2 : Well
1 : I mean we could risk-
2 : Mm
2 : No, I wouldn't risk it
3 : We have fifteen minutes
1 : Oh my gosh
1 : Ok
4 : Let's-
2 : Pilot, it's your turn right now.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Do you- how close are you to her-
1 : Right now?
3 : (--)
3 : Close
1 : 'Cause like-
1 : She also has two
3 : Mm, ok.
4 : Oh, true.
1 : Um, I think you could do that
4 : So if you move, move-
4 : Or, I mean you can fly yourself there.
1 : Yeah
1 : I would fly yourself.
1 : 'Cause my place doesn't matter
1 : (--)
3 : I can fly myself here-
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Unshore both of those
3 : Shore this one- shore this one up and give her the fire thing
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : So (--) hopefully she can get another time it gets to her
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : So, one-
3 : Two-
3 : THree.
2 : Good
4 : Unflood-
3 : The Dunes-
3 : Bronze Gate and-
3 : Cave of Shadows
3 : Where's the Cave of Shadows?
3 : Right here
3 : Uh oh
1 : Oh
1 : Ok
1 : So, that's an important one
4 : Alright
4 : I-
1 : Ok
2 : I also have sandbags, too.
1 : Ok
4 : When can you use that?
1 : Whenever
2 : Anytime
1 : Um
1 : But when we pick a flood card, it has to be used imediately. So I don't think you can use a sandbag
1 : So
1 : Is there anymore- so we still have this one left so I don't think we should use it unless-
2 : Yeah
3 : (Mm ok)
4 : Well, I can do-
1 : Hmm?
4 : If I move here-
4 : Not that it-
4 : Helps that much-
4 : But I can give him-
3 : I would give her- I would give her those two cards-
1 : Oh
4 : I don't think I can give both of them
3 : It would count as-
2 : Two actions
3 : Two actions
4 : Oh
1 : Wait
1 : No, you should move here and give him your two cards
4 : But, she's over here-
4 : Yeah
3 : Wait, why?
3 : 'Cause then you can- you can-
4 : Because-
2 : Because you're
1 : Because I'm not close.
3 : You- one, two-
3 : That would be a third move, ok.
1 : Yeah
1 : And-
1 : It's her turn
3 : Yeah, ok, that makes sense
4 : So if I move-
4 : One-
2 : There
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Two-
1 : Mm give (--) the Pilot
3 : (--)
4 : Three?
2 : Pilot, Pilot.
4 : Oh
3 : Ok
1 : 'Cause then
4 : Three
3 : I have to discard two cards now, right?
2 : Yeah, and that's fine
4 : Yeah, we don't need those
4 : So I need two cards
4 : So we just have to make sure-
1 : Oh
1 : 'k
4 : That gets-
4 : Flooded whoever can-
1 : Mmhmm
1 : And-
1 : Need these two
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Mm three
4 : I would need another one
1 : Oh, ok
4 : Cave of Embers, Misty Marsh-
4 : Hollowing-
4 : Howling Garden
1 : Ok
3 : Mm we don't have to worry about that or that one.
1 : So, I don't know if you want to use one of your sandbags now-
2 : Yeah, this is fine
4 : And save what?
1 : Or, I guess-
1 : Ok
3 : Oh, yeah, you-
2 : And save this one?
1 : Ok, well I can-
1 : So-
1 : It's my turn now
1 : Um
4 : You can just save that one
1 : I'll save this one so it's not as important
3 : What don't you have to do two for one? Is that your thing?
1 : I can do two for one but they have to be next to each-
3 : You can just flip these two
4 : Both of-
1 : Can I?
3 : Yeah, (if we counted it)
1 : Up to two tiles-
3 : So if it- does it-
3 : (It's)-
2 : This doesn't cont as an action
2 : So it's
3 : Yah
2 : It can be played at anytime. So yeah, you could do that
3 : (But she can do- she can do)-
4 : But she can do it with her power
3 : Two for the price of one
2 : But, (wouldn't you have to be) next to it?
3 : Mm
4 : She does
3 : She is next to- yeah she's next to- just those two
1 : I don't know if that means this- ok
2 : Oh, you're red. Yeah, yeah
3 : (--)
2 : Yeah
2 : Sorry
3 : So- so that would count as one action, flipping those two
4 : So that's one action
4 : and then
1 : (--)
3 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : ok
1 : and then
4 : I guess just (--)
4 : move to Fool's Landing maybe, in case we get
3 : Yeah (--) just in case we're there
4 : K so two
2 : Well that's diagonal
4 : But she can one, two
3 : One, two, alright
1 : K
3 : Yeah
4 : Well she already did
1 : Wait
4 : Oh wait
1 : Give me a second to think
1 : Um
1 : we're all so much closer to this one
1 : what if I just did like
1 : (--) cause we don't really care about those, if I just went
1 : one, two, and flipped this one over
4 : Oh, I see what you're saying
1 : Does that make more sense?
2 : We could do that too, yeah
3 : Yeah, yeah
4 : So like there?
2 : So
2 : leave that flipped
1 : Yeah and go one, two, flip
2 : Two
2 : flip, yeah, do that.
4 : Uh three, good call
3 : (--)
1 : Ok
4 : (--)
1 : Well now we have one of these
3 : (--)
4 : That'll work, hopefully
1 : Ok, we're still at three
1 : um is there
3 : We can't even fly-
3 : (--) Rise card.
1 : Oh yeah
1 : oh (--) ok
3 : We've got twelve minutes.
4 : It- We're still good though.
1 : One, two,
1 : three.
1 : Ok, Bronze Gate
3 : Right there.
1 : It's gone.
1 : Cave of Shadows
2 : Ok, it's a good think you did that.
4 : Yeah.
1 : Yeah, wow.
3 : (--) just put that
1 : Misty Marsh
1 : Ok
1 : we're still good.
4 : We're still good.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Right
2 : Ok
2 : my turn.
4 : Yes.
1 : Yes.
2 : Do you want me to go boom, boom, collect? And that's three.
4 : (--)
3 : (--)
2 : Oh I don't
1 : And I didn't get one.
4 : I didn't get one till after my turn
1 : But it can't hurt to be on it
3 : Yeah
1 : for when you get it.
4 : Oh, one,
1 : And then
4 : two,
1 : one of us can fly you there
1 : Which one- Ok so are we just banking on
1 : Well wait, he has that too, we only need three.
1 : maybe you just wanna make
4 : So if we just get through her turn
3 : Mm
1 : maybe you just wanna make your way here.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : That makes the most sense.
3 : Except, I can collect there, then fly myself here, then fly us out.
1 : You could collect here and fly here there, cause you can fly
4 : And someone has to fly me
3 : Oh yeah, I was (--) yeah.
1 : another person.
4 : without it. Yeah, that'll work
1 : And then we won
3 : Yeah
4 : So get to Fool's Landing.
2 : Alright
2 : one, two, three
1 : One
4 : Pick cards
3 : Wait, wait, wait
2 : And should I just use this now to flip that over?
4 : Yeah, cause that doesn't count as a turn.
2 : Yeah
3 : It just (--)
4 : Might as well.
3 : Wait, no, no, no, no, no, just in case we get this.
1 : I would save it, yeah, just in case this comes up.
3 : (--) yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : so
4 : cause we don't need that if he's gonna
3 : (--)
1 : Did you move then
4 : do that one.
4 : Or just in case that one gets flipped, we're still gonna need it.
1 : Yeah
4 : You have to discard one
2 : Alright, so, we don't
3 : Yeah (--)
2 : need this.
1 : I don't need that.
3 : Yeah.
1 : Ok, I know
1 : three.
4 : Flood cards.
2 : Dunes of Deception,
1 : Ok
2 : Cave of Embers,
2 : (--)
2 : Howling Garden.
2 : Oh
1 : Oh, it didn't matter.
4 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : Some treasure
3 : Ok, so I'm gonna collect the treasure.
4 : So that's one.
1 : Nice.
1 : And then I'm gonna fly you to
3 : Ok
4 : Fly yourself
3 : (--)
1 : Can fly one action- Or
3 : So I can use this card to fly both of us here
4 : And then
4 : can she use that card even though it's not her turn?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : I'm not
3 : Yeah, because (--)
1 : Why do I need it?
4 : We need to fly ourselves off
3 : Cause I'm gonna use this, I'm gonna use, I'm gonna use this to fly us here.
2 : We will be good.
2 : We're out.
1 : Oh, yeah
3 : So I'm gonna use this to fly us here
4 : Get rid of that.
3 : This (--) this.
4 : And use that
3 : Use that card to fly us out.
1 : Yay, guys that was great
1 : That was intense, my heart started to beat fast.
4 : When he said fifteen minutes I was like

1 : Ok so
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Should I just
1 : move here and then just save these two
1 : as one action and then this one as another?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yup
2 : That's two actions, three actions. Alright

3 : Mmhmm
2 : So now two more
2 : I could move and save Cliffs of Abandon.
1 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : I don't have much else I could do
2 : Or should I move down to here?
2 : Just to stay closer.
3 : Yeah
3 : I mean cause we have all of these in one area right next to Fool's Landing.
2 : Yeah that's true yeah so we'll stay down here.
1 : Yeah

3 : If we need to
2 : Ok

2 : Not yet
1 : Crimson Forest
2 : It's up there
1 : Copper Gate
1 : and Tidal Palace
2 : We don't need any of those. Yeah.
3 : To worry about that
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok so
2 : I should
2 : give you this for one
3 : Ok
2 : Guess that doesn't really use my special power but
2 : Ok ah
2 : Then what else do we need?
3 : Um we need to be able to give you these.
2 : So you should stay.
2 : Well
3 : You're gonna want to move here,
2 : Yeah but I need to get it.
3 : so we'll meet you here.
1 : Yeah I would stay there for now cause I'm gonna want to move down and give mine to you to.
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so I'll stay there.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : You're turn you'll give me yours.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
2 : So good
1 : Mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : For
2 : Water's Rising
3 : We're ok with
2 : Yeah I think so

2 : Oh wait
2 : Still on three? Right? yeah.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : So Temple of the Sun
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and Crimson Forest
3 : And you said
2 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
3 : and there.
2 : Mm
2 : Um should I use my Sandbag for
2 : Temple of the Sun or should we wait?
1 : Um I would use it.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ah I'd say just in cause because we might be in a little bif of trouble if not.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok, so now your turn?
3 : I'm going to immediately give you this.
2 : So that's one.
3 : So that's one.
3 : Um
3 : Sandbag thanks.
3 : Ah
3 : cause I don't really need to do anything else do I?
1 : Nmhmm
2 : No so maybe
1 : I would say stay there just in case I'd
1 : anyone else gets something really.
3 : Ok
2 : Yeah so we can trade cards around.
1 : Cause you're within distance.
3 : Makes sense
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah so maybe we could draw
3 : Um
2 : Oh
1 : Stocking up
3 : Ah ok
3 : probably one of these.
2 : Yeah, yeah
1 : Yeah
2 : I mean we still have two so that's good.
3 : Yeah get rid of one after what happened last time.
2 : I know
3 : But ok ah three
2 : Ok so three
3 : So we have the Bridge
3 : Tidal Palace is gone and Copper Gate is gone.
3 : Discard that
3 : I'll take your (--)
3 : and I'm done.
2 : Ok
1 : Ah
2 : So you need to move down to me first.
1 : I think
1 : I think
1 : No I don't need to save those at all.
2 : Yeah
1 : And then you give me this
2 : And then give me that for two
1 : and then I think I'm good.
1 : Right?
3 : I mean we could
2 : You could move back up to
3 : Have saved them
3 : Anyways you know
3 : You did
3 : the one two three
2 : we don't really need then though. We just need this area right here
1 : yeah
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I think we're good with that.
3 : And just
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : I just get worried when we draw cards and they start being these ones
3 : Like the more we keep in even if
2 : Yeah
3 : Instead of
3 : getting rid of a turn there.
1 : I get that yeah. Wait so I used
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah that makes sense so that was your
2 : so we'll say that
2 : what are you again red?
3 : On the first she did that.
2 : On your first one you did these two.
1 : Ok
1 : And then
2 : Second you moved third you gave me the card.
1 : Yup
2 : Ok
2 : So here's your two.
1 : Yay.
2 : Oh! Yay.
3 : Whoo! I should do that more often.
1 : Um Cave of Shadows.
1 : Dunes of Deception.
1 : And Silver Gate.
1 : (--)
2 : Yeah
2 : Alright
2 : So my turn
2 : First I'll do oh
2 : First I should
2 : do this, shore up this one.
3 : Yeah I think that's smart.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Shore up one.
2 : Move two.
2 : Get the treasure, three.
3 : Three.
2 : Alright
2 : And that's all I can do then.
1 : Yeah
3 : Alright
2 : Yeah so I got these two.
2 : My next turn I can give you this one.
3 : Well I mean she's gonna get it.
2 : Or you got it so ok.
3 : Um I was just trying to figure out the best way to get us all over there so.
3 : Quickly as possible.
2 : Ok so Howling Gardens.
2 : Cave of Embers.
2 : It doesn't matter.
3 : (--)
3 : Hmm
2 : And Bronze Gate doesn't matter.
3 : Cool.
2 : I think I'm lucky with that.
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : Now your turn. So
2 : Maybe you should use
3 : If I stand, oh it doesn't matter.
3 : Hmm
3 : Wait
3 : If I stand with you
3 : Hmm
3 : on any time after she gets that I can just fly us both over.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Using one.
3 : And can she just do one get one three?
1 : Yup
2 : Yeah yeah
3 : And then we fly?
1 : Yup
3 : Ok
3 : So we got our airplane? I'm gonna shore this up.
3 : Move one, shore up two.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : Been there.
3 : Should we just fly over him?
3 : Can I fly now? I guess I drew.
2 : Well it doesn't matter, you can use that at any point.
3 : Right
3 : Um
3 : Yeah
1 : Nope.
2 : No nope.
3 : Ok
1 : Um three.
3 : So we have Observatory.
3 : Of the Watchtower.
3 : Tower
2 : Watchtower.
3 : And the Misty Marsh.
3 : All good?
3 : Thank you.
2 : Move one
3 : And capture two.
1 : Then move three.
3 : Three
2 : Hmm
3 : Let's fly us to any time.
3 : and fly us all away.
2 : And then use that.
3 : Yeah we did.
2 : We did good.

1 : Mmhmm
4 : I'm much better at word games
1 : Is each one of these considered
1 : an action, like each single step?
3 : I think we can only do one
1 : Ok
4 : Take up to three
3 : That was my understanding, cause (--) you'd just be hopping all around the place.
4 : actions.
2 : Yeah
1 : Right
4 : Well the three actions are move, shore up
4 : give a treasure card or capture a treasure.
1 : Right, but moving one
4 : Yeah
2 : One space is one action.
1 : one step at a time is a single action. K gotcha
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : K
1 : So my first thought was again to
1 : exploit
1 : the advantage that
1 : I have, that you don't have
1 : um considering how much flooding is going on around me.
1 : Um and so I thought of
3 : Mmhmm
1 : getting some of these guys
2 : Mmhmm
3 : I think so, for sure
1 : switched over, would that be right?
1 : Um
3 : cover our bases.
1 : So
3 : You don't have to move to flood, right? Uh
1 : Yeah I don't have to move I guess I would, so I would
4 : But if you- You have to be adjacent right?
1 : Yes
4 : So if you moved to
4 : this one then you could flip
4 : these two.
4 : Or if you didn't move you could
1 : Right
1 : Or I could move, flip
4 : Yeah, sorry
3 : But he's a little isolated out there so maybe
1 : I, I, I'm less concerned about getting to this one, especially since there's no
4 : Well
1 : um
1 : little symbol- There is (--)
3 : treasure, yeah.
4 : Yeah, yeah
1 : what it is when (--) it was purple (--), so
1 : If I did this as a first move
1 : right?
3 : Then you could fip
2 : Yeah
1 : and then
3 : That was two, was another
4 : Yeah
1 : flip these two as another.
2 : Yeah
3 : Uh huh
1 : Let's go ahead and do that and
1 : bring it up,
3 : Alright guys this is good.
3 : This is good, good start.
2 : Yeah
1 : bring the color out.
3 : So that was one for the move, two for the flip,
1 : And then
4 : You could flip this one too cause you're (--) that, right?
1 : Right
1 : and I could flip another one, (--) don't say (--)
4 : Cause you're (--)
1 : not to, I mean can I
4 : Shore up
4 : uh, shore up any adjacent tile
4 : Oh it has to be- Ok that's adjacent. Or the island tile your pawn, your pawn is on. So you can
1 : The yeah-
1 : your pawn is on, so
4 : do that one,
4 : yeah.
1 : Alright so that'll be three,
3 : Ok
1 : that'll be my three.
2 : And so you, now you need two treasure cards.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And now two treasure cards.
1 : Alright
1 : So got the fire thing and one of them is Water's Rise.
2 : So the water's rise is the only one you have to do first
3 : We have to play right now.
1 : Right
3 : The cards are stacked against us
3 : I can tell
1 : Alright
1 : move the water level up one tick
1 : Alright
1 : and then shuffle the flood discard pile
3 : Yeah and we gotta throw those guys away.
1 : and place it on top of the flood draw.
4 : (--)
4 : Alright now what goes over in the discard
3 : Yeah and then this guy's
1 : And then this one goes in that corner there, correct.
2 : Yeah
3 : and we do it
3 : up right? Yes
4 : Yup
2 : Alright
3 : cool.
4 : Ok
2 : So how many did, do you need to take from this?
4 : Ok
4 : you got to two
3 : Two
4 : Yeah
1 : Alright
1 : Alright Cliffs of Abaond and Breaker's Ridge
1 : so
1 : (--) I just
1 : flip em right back I guess
2 : Well it was a good decision then cause otherwise they'd be gone now.
1 : Yeah
3 : They'd be sunk, yeah.
4 : Right
4 : mm.
1 : Alright and then these go in here?
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Yup those go up also.
2 : Mmhm
1 : Ok
4 : Alright
3 : Cool, alright Messenger.
4 : Sweet
2 : Ok
3 : So what do we have, what are you near?
2 : So
2 : I'm over here
2 : So
3 : And you have a red and a gold
3 : Gold ok
4 : Hmm (--)
2 : So since we know the Cliffs of Abandon is here
2 : I should probably move and flip that back over?
3 : Can you move that
4 : Uh no you can only go up or down, left or right
2 : No
3 : Yeah you can't move
2 : But if I move
1 : Yeah that's what I had been asking about before. If that one and then two and then flip
2 : I can do adjacent ones
3 : One, two
4 : Oh that's right you can do an adjacent pointing to this.
4 : Shore up
4 : shore up any adjacent island tile up, down, left, or right
4 : or the one that you're on.
4 : So if you move to that one
1 : Yeah you actually wouldn't even have to go here, you could just move over the one and then flip it
4 : Right cause it's, it's adjacent, yup.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Put that bad boy back on.
4 : Cool
2 : So that was two actions, moving and then flipping.
1 : Correct.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
2 : And so
4 : We're not ev-
2 : Um
4 : not gonna give a card or capture a treasure.
2 : I could give a card if anyone-
2 : So you have a
1 : Mm
2 : a lion and you have a fire
2 : Is there anything that we're closer by that would make more sense for me to give up first?
3 : I don't know if it makes sense to be giving up stuff right now, cause we still don't know
4 : Mm
1 : Right and there's also, there's
2 : Ok
1 : two of everything out right now, right
1 : so
4 : Yup
3 : Yeah
1 : There's not like a natural one to go to right?
4 : Yup
4 : K so now you draw
3 : Or you still have another move
1 : No you don't have to use it
2 : But you don't have to use it.
3 : You don't have to.
1 : Up to three
2 : Cause I don't- I'm not by anything else to help
4 : Yeah
2 : flip anything else over.
2 : Unless you want me to head somewhere, I can just move,
2 : like make a move towards the- like the
3 : Should we all try to be like in charge of
3 : a treasure?
3 : Like because you have a gold guy like-
3 : you can like, maybe like hang out around here,
3 : or is that premature?
2 : I think- Yeah I think it's
1 : Well the only issue with that is we could draw at anytime
2 : Yeah
2 : And then have to move
3 : And then just
1 : the ones that flip it
3 : Yeah
1 : Would there be any reason to kind of stay towards the middle until we have more information, I mean
3 : Well if
3 : we need to like share cards if we're close to each other, it's easier to move there and then do the swapping.
1 : That's a good point
1 : that's a good point
3 : So
2 : So just not take a third move then and just move into the cards?
3 : What's your special thing? Give a single card per action to any one anywhere
2 : It's giving
2 : Yeah so I could give
2 : my card
2 : to the other people that have cards like this
2 : or we could wait.
2 : But I'm the only one who can do that so
3 : That makes me think
4 : Well
4 : should you draw your cards
4 : to see what
4 : you end up with?
3 : Or do we have play first, yeah
2 : I, I have to take my actions first before I can draw my treasure cards.
4 : Oh ok
4 : ok
3 : So
3 : what if you just give him the red?
2 : I'm good with that.
3 : Yeah and then you know what
1 : Fine make it my problem
3 : if it doesn't work out you guys can like hook up on another
3 : square and then give it back.
4 : But the issue though
4 : Sorry
4 : is that if he has that
4 : he has to draw two cards so he's gonna have to give up one of his pairs
1 : I'm gonna have to discard something next time
4 : One of his pairs is gonna have to go in the pile
3 : Mm that's true
3 : That's true but we don't have anybody else that has fire right now
4 : Nope
1 : Yeah I don't think there was a natural
3 : Yeah I think we just gotta, yeah
1 : but we don't have enough information yet to
1 : definitively say what the
3 : make a real choice.
1 : if there is a right move. So I'm gonna just do it and see what happens.
3 : Cool so you got your sandbags, you got your
3 : Flying things- Wow that turned out really well
2 : Yeah um
2 : I have to wait to use this right, cause this is an action? So now I just do the flood
3 : Uh
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Correct
3 : Yeah
3 : and it's still two floods
1 : Dun dun dun
3 : Let's enjoy it while we still have two floods
1 : I know right
2 : So Phantom Rock and Lost Lagoon
3 : Phantom Rock is
2 : That one's gone
3 : So is this one.
4 : Oh they're both gone.
2 : Ah
3 : We're sunk.
1 : Oh
3 : That's cool though cause we don't even need these ones they don't have the
3 : the treasures on them
1 : Right they just give us a few more steps, potentially.
3 : Yeah
4 : K
1 : It's also less to worry about though.
3 : Cool
3 : alright so
3 : I only have one of these rocky looking things
3 : If we wanna keep a couple of these guys maybe
3 : So
3 : we don't need to keep the ones that don't have the treasure right?
2 : You're the
3 : Are they just kinda like
3 : just another place to be?
4 : Well I think
4 : strategically that one would be an ok one to go away
4 : because it's on an outside
3 : I think so, yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : So
3 : I can
3 : move anywhere on the island
3 : so if I move somewhere who's
3 : near someone who needs this
3 : I could give it to them.
3 : The only other person with this is gonna be you Explorer.
1 : This
4 : Mm
3 : We're both equally far
1 : (--)
3 : Actually I'm really close here
2 : Yeah you're actually you're closer
3 : Yeah
3 : so why don't I just
2 : But you have to be on the same one to give it to her
2 : like to exchange.
3 : Yeah but
1 : But you can fly there,
3 : Yeah so I can like fly to you and then hang out and then you can give me the other one and then I can
3 : you know, move towards this guy.
1 : fly back to the
4 : Or
1 : the Temple.
4 : Ok I see what you're saying (--)
2 : But we still need two more cards anyway.
3 : Yeah
3 : Yeah I'm kinda cool hanging over here
1 : While you do that, maybe we should, now that we have three of the four lions, I wonder if we should start thinking about how to
4 : Mm
1 : bring home the flying lion
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
1 : Uh if there's- Oh wait now what can the Pilot do to facilitate that?
3 : Not much, I can just kinda fly around.
1 : Not much right now.
3 : But what I can do is if
3 : the flying lion people are close to each other I can, I can fly you both
3 : to the flying lion
3 : and then you can do the card exchange there.
3 : That's what I can offer.
4 : Mm
2 : Ok
3 : So right now is, again it's a little premature
4 : We still have to find another one
2 : Ok
1 : Or do you wanna just f-
3 : So I can
2 : Draw your treasure cards.
3 : Should I just do it?
1 : Cna you fly somewhere, flip it, and fly back?
1 : Are those
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : I mean why not- Oh
2 : Oh,
3 : I could right?
1 : You wanna just do that and just
3 : Yeah why don't I just flip this bad boy?
1 : Keep, keep one step
2 : Yeah so fly
1 : This one here? Yeah
3 : This guy?
3 : Fly, one,
1 : So fly, flip,
3 : two,
1 : and then fly home.
3 : three, cool.
3 : I hope that's not against the rules.
2 : Oh
3 : The p-
3 : Only once per turn, oh
3 : So I can't
3 : But I can fly here and flip this
2 : And then flip it
4 : And flip it, yup
3 : And then I can move here
2 : and then stay there.
1 : Oh gotcha
1 : Ok, hmm
2 : Ok
3 : That's cool
3 : alright.
3 : Uh
3 : pull two of these
3 : Oh I got another Helicopter Lift
1 : Count it.
3 : and I got the chalice.
1 : Count it.
1 : Alright so you're sittting near five right?
1 : Oh wait- Oh no you'res sitting at four. That's your- That doesn't count. That's your
3 : Is this not- This isn't a card right? Yeah, that's kinda misleading.
4 : Hmm
1 : Oh (you are card)
3 : Ok
3 : And then you have the chalices so at some point we should probably like
1 : We should totally get together
3 : try to get together and do that yeah.
1 : Yeah
3 : I can fly to you, don't worry about it
3 : Alright let's do
3 : let's
1 : Yes you need your two flood cards now.
3 : Right?
4 : Yeah cause you do your
3 : Temple of the Moon and Golden Gate, alright
3 : buh bye
1 : Buh bye
4 : Mm
1 : And what's it called?
3 : Temple of the Moon.
1 : Temple of the Moon.
3 : Oh this guy- Oh no that's Temple of the Sun
1 : That's Temple of the Sun
4 : Mm
3 : Temple of the Moon
4 : Mm
1 : Oh oh
3 : But
3 : Explorer can move and shore up diagonally. Oh so you're gonna wanna probably
3 : flip that over for him.
4 : But I can only go one
3 : Oh
3 : we don't have to move that up.
3 : Ok sorry I just wanna make sure we didn't have to (--) that.
4 : Right
3 : So
4 : I can only move one space?
3 : can move and or shore up diagonally.
3 : So that would just count one of your turns.
1 : Right
3 : And I think you should save him
1 : I appreciate it.
4 : So move over diagonally?
3 : Oh wait you're green. Oh I thought you were gray for some reason.
4 : Oh
4 : (--)
3 : Uh the Explorer can move and shore up diagonally
2 : Well you can make two moves
3 : Or- No so you can move and or shore up, so you can move
2 : And then flip
1 : Right right
1 : and then shore up
3 : and then shore up
1 : adjacent
4 : Oh ok
3 : Cause we don't want you to sink
1 : So one
1 : right
1 : two
3 : two
3 : and then
3 : let's look at our cards and see what we
3 : have going on here.
2 : If you
1 : Should we get you to the lion?
4 : Yeah cause I can give a treasure card
2 : It would be, it would be two actions though right? Cause we have to be on the same, like she would have to move up, and then she would have to give me the card, which would be two. She only has one left.
1 : Should we start, start collecting
3 : Yeah
1 : Oh ok that's a good point.
3 : So
1 : I didn't realize- I forgot about that.
2 : But I could give her both my card ooo
2 : Well if she went on that tile
4 : How? We have to be on the same tile
2 : I could use two actions to give her my cards
1 : But she can't get all the way over there just yet
4 : I should've moved over there
4 : No cause we still needed to shore that up.
1 : Uh mm hmm hmm
3 : Yeah we needed to flip you
4 : Yup
1 : You saved the (--)
3 : Because if not we have the treasure on that, so if for some reason we get a flood
1 : And you can also get there
3 : Mmhmm
1 : quickly with your
3 : So I
3 : think
2 : Well we could do that
2 : is
3 : What if you guys just get close together?
2 : because
2 : Yeah, say if you got closer and then
2 : on your turn, since we don't want to like,
2 : lose, since we have pairs, you can give me maybe two of those?
3 : Exactly
2 : Like either one, and then I'll give up my cards.
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
3 : and then
3 : as, as your first move
2 : Yeah
3 : and then you can pick up the two and then work from there. I think that's a good idea.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
1 : (--)
4 : So what am I doing?
4 : I was done moving
4 : correct?
1 : You're good.
2 : Right
2 : Yeah so two treasures.
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Alright so now I have to do the
4 : Alrighty
1 : Mm
3 : Nice
4 : Alright we have the four chalice cards showing
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Sweet
4 : Can I give (--)
4 : Or if I moved all of my other- I've moved and I've shored up
1 : Yeah you (--)
3 : Uh
1 : The actions have to completely preceed the you know
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok so let's do the
3 : sinking
1 : Mm go
4 : Keep your fingers crossed
4 : Whispering Gardens and Iron Gate
3 : Iron Gate, ok
1 : Ok
4 : K
3 : Alright we gotta make sure we- Cause that's got the treasure.
1 : So just bear in mind we have- Right
4 : Yup
1 : Alright we good?
4 : That's it.
1 : Ok
1 : mm
3 : We need to be c-
3 : ready for a flood card to come.
4 : Yeah
3 : I think that's what we need you to be here for.
1 : So presumably I
1 : could get over here,
1 : get that back, if we wanted it.
1 : Or we can
2 : You're the red person right?
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Or I could start distributing these
1 : (--) cause we also have
1 : We have these four
2 : Yeah
1 : Can you give only one card at a time?
2 : It's like one action per card
3 : Per card yeah, giving a single card
2 : So it's like you could give me
1 : Ok so I can move one over and give two cards, or move twice and give one.
2 : You could give two to somebody
3 : But you need to be at the same place so
1 : Right
1 : right
4 : Mm
2 : Um
3 : You could
3 : uh
4 : (--)
2 : So you could move one action,
2 : two action, and then give me one of the cards this time.
1 : Right
2 : And then, when it's my turn in a minute
1 : and
3 : You're gonna give those over
2 : I can give
2 : mine
1 : (--)
2 : but then if I give you two
1 : That's two actions
2 : If I give you those two then that means you have to get rid of
4 : I have to get rid of
2 : one of the cards.
4 : yeah.
1 : Well if we
1 : do that
1 : should
1 : I move to say this then?
3 : I think so
1 : Wouldn't that be the
1 : (--) one, two
1 : and then
3 : Oh
2 : And then flip
3 : yeah
1 : flip that.
3 : I think we should cause I'm just afraid of that sinking and then we lose our opportunity
1 : And (--)
1 : and then we have to get all the way down to the other end.
2 : Yeah
1 : And we have potentially the benefit of (--) right there.
2 : Ok so that was three
3 : And then other thing is I can play this at any time.
1 : Yes
3 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any tile
3 : or lift your team of Fool's Island. So I can move people who are like hanging out with me
3 : anywhere.
1 : Right
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh look you got two people on one.
2 : Yeah that's me and him.
1 : Mhmm
3 : So you guys can do the swap.
1 : We're walking down the Marsh. Alright
1 : um ok, uh god (--)
1 : Um can I just discard the Water's Rise card? Does that count? (--)
3 : Well we have to use it immediately so then you still have five cards
2 : Yeah we have to use it right away
1 : Oh bummer
4 : Yup
1 : Alright um
4 : (--)
1 : So (--)
1 : to three
1 : Alright shuffle the flood discard pile
2 : You good?
3 : That's what
4 : I don't know
3 : (--)
1 : Yup that's
3 : At least you don't have to worry about losing this
1 : This is why, this is why we flip stuff
1 : And then place it on top
3 : Alright I'll take that guy and discard
1 : And then discard this card into that pile
2 : And then now you have to take three of these ones
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mm
1 : Right
1 : Let's see here, Iron Gate
3 : Cool we don't need that guy.
3 : Dead weight.
1 : Breaker's Bridge and Whispering Garden again. That poor garden just
1 : too much water, not enough water
2 : It's a good thing we keep flipping it though, cause it keep going back over
3 : Breaker
1 : See
3 : Cause if not that thing would've been sunk
2 : Ok
1 : Yup
3 : then we would have to somehow- And but again I can fly
4 : Mm
1 : So would we
3 : And I can fly you guys too and I keep forgetting that.
3 : Ok
1 : Alright
1 : you're up Messenger, let's see um
2 : Yes
3 : Messenger
2 : So I should probably flip that Whispering Garden
2 : and then
3 : Yeah I think we should keep our options open.
1 : Yeah if we, if, if we get another flood card there's a good chance that this one's drawn again, now- especially now that we're at three.
4 : It
3 : Mmhmm
4 : You and I should be together on the same tile
4 : so that she can fly us up to here so that we can exchange
4 : cards
2 : I can give my cards to anyone
2 : that's my p- power, I don't have to be on the same
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh right
2 : Tile thing, but the thing is now I have two, but if I give you both that means you have to get rid of something
4 : Oh
2 : you have now.
4 : One I'd have to discard
2 : Yes
1 : Do discards go
1 : to the bottom of that or the pile?
4 : In the pile
1 : Ok so we'd be done with
1 : one of em
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mm
4 : Ok
3 : But it seems like there's so many
4 : nois
1 : Oh are there more than four- oh there must be. Yeah ok. For some reason I was thinking like if we get rid of the chalice and that's it, that's the one we can't get.
3 : There must be so it seems like we just gotta like
4 : Yeah
3 : Seems like we should just like risk it.
1 : Ok
3 : I mean it look- Again, I've never played this, but it looks like there's more in here.
4 : Yeah
1 : There would always have to be
1 : Yeah
4 : We have those nasty little Water Rise's
4 : Do
2 : So should I give you both of these?
2 : And then you'll discard
2 : one of yours
4 : This one?
1 : Discard the chalice. Oh actually no, we have all- We have four of both of them so it doesn't
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Oh ok
1 : really matter.
1 : I don't think.
2 : You can have
3 : And then we have four of both so
3 : those rock thing or the chalice so it doesn't matter.
1 : Right, exactly?
1 : Rock things, the official
4 : Ok
4 : rock
4 : is going away
3 : I'm gonna discard that guy.
4 : Alright so this
1 : There you go.
4 : Three of the four
2 : So that's my three turns.
1 : Three of a kind over there
2 : Got another sandbag and another lion.
1 : Hey
3 : Nice
4 : Ooo
1 : So yeah it's
3 : So what does it say (--) do again?
2 : Um
2 : shore up any one island-
2 : one tile on the island
3 : Any one tile
3 : before it sinks, but it can't be used with the flood deck.
2 : So I-
2 : Does that mean I don't have to be next to it I can just
4 : Mmhmm
2 : choose this one and then shore up
3 : Yeah is it at any time?
2 : I mean not on this turn, not
1 : On your next turn, um
2 : um
3 : It says any time
1 : (--)
4 : sandbags can shore up
2 : Yeah
4 : any one tile before it sinks but it can't be used if the flood deck card for the sinking tile is already drawn.
3 : So it can be used at any time though
4 : Mm
3 : Is that true?
1 : It looks like the only limitation is you can't
1 : use it
4 : Yes
1 : to save something that was just flooded completely and is sunk.
4 : Yeah cause it says action cards can otherwise be played and discarded at any time not just your turn and do not count as an action.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : Cool
1 : There you go.
3 : That's good to know.
2 : So we're the-
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : maybe it's already gone.
4 : There's bronze and silver
2 : I don't- Oh wait
1 : Mm must be
2 : Silver Gate
3 : Gold Gate it's already gone.
4 : Yeah
2 : And Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Oh
4 : Oh oh
1 : It's alright, we, we got your back,
1 : we're all close.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : We'll flip it.
3 : Ok
3 : so
3 : I have a feeling-
3 : So you are the Explorer.
3 : Cause I feel like I need to move you two together so you can get that last golden card.
3 : Right but we can only exchange cards
3 : when it's your turn right, so you can only give when it's your turn.
2 : If you can,
2 : you can take her though to the
2 : either
2 : palace
2 : and then
3 : And how you gonna get it to her?
3 : Because my power's I can move two people.
2 : Because I don't have to be on the same tile to give my card up
2 : I'm the one who has to give a card up
3 : Oh yeah ok
2 : So she just has to be
3 : Near it
2 : on the a- Yeah that way whenever it's her action she can get that
3 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile
2 : So maybe first
3 : Maybe I should fly to
2 : flip
2 : Oh maybe this one
3 : You think I should
3 : Yeah I have to move and then flip though.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Mmhmm
3 : One
3 : two
2 : Two
3 : Well should I just fly somewhere?
1 : Oh
1 : definitely want you off of this.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : So I don't know like fly here.
4 : Yeah
4 : Oh
4 : Oh poo
2 : Temple of the Sun
1 : Oh
1 : that's harsh.
4 : That's the Moon.
1 : That's the Moon.
1 : Um
2 : Temple of the Moon.
3 : That's the one
4 : The Sun's over here
2 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Ok well why don't I hang out over here in case that guy goes.?
1 : Ok
4 : Yeah
1 : (--) away.
3 : So I have to get rid of one of these
3 : I can't give it though right? I have to throw it away
4 : Oh that's right you have to discard.
2 : Oh yeah
3 : so what should I
2 : Well since you have two of the
1 : Why don't you dump the purple one
3 : This one?
1 : since that- That's the old- We already dumped one of em.
2 : Or
2 : the- One of the Helicopters- How many Helicopter things do you need?
3 : So these are the ones that I can lift our
3 : team off Fool's
3 : Landing
3 : or I can move the players but these are any time so that's kind of cool.
1 : Yeah those are pretty valuable.
4 : Mm
3 : So if it's kind of like oh this, this might flood, ah
2 : Well maybe you should get rid of your lion one then cause if I'm gonna give her mine on my turn then you don't need that.
3 : Yeah
3 : Let's do it
1 : Good call.
3 : Ok
4 : And now the flood tiles.
1 : How many- Oh my goodness gracious.
2 : Three
3 : Alright Tidal Palace,
3 : Copper Gate,
4 : Mm
3 : Crimson Forest.
2 : (Up top)
4 : Alright
3 : Least the thing didn't go up.
1 : That's right.
4 : Should I move diagonally to here?
2 : Yeah I think we should try flipping some of those back over
3 : Yeah I think we should flip
2 : So
3 : What if you flip, move, flip
2 : You
4 : So
1 : Don't
2 : you can flip diagonally
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : you can shore up diagonally.
2 : So if you move here
3 : So what if you move, flip
2 : Can you flip and flip?
1 : Well don't forget I'll be able to do two, also, next turn.
3 : Yeah, that's true.
1 : But I can't move diagonally.
1 : So if you moved here and flipped
1 : or shored up that one
3 : I think you gotta get here
4 : So I can turn these itn.
3 : Yeah, or actually I can fly you there, so it doesn't matter.
1 : Mmkay
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok so
4 : we're running out of time.
1 : Oh I didn't even realize we had that.
4 : Am I uh
4 : doing this?
3 : I think we gotta flip this guy cause we need that.
1 : Yup
4 : Ok
4 : So that's
4 : two
1 : And then I think you're right, with her Helicopter Lifts it's
1 : kinda irrelevant where you move from here.
2 : And so then just leave that and do the card draw?
1 : Yeah
3 : Why don't you just flip this one
3 : while you can?
2 : Oh yeah as another action? Yeah.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah might as well.
2 : Ok
3 : Just flip it
3 : Yeah
2 : number three.
3 : You guys we also have to think about this one.
2 : Yeah
4 : Oh crap.
4 : Water's Rise.
1 : Alright
3 : We gotta shuffle those bad boys
4 : Put that over there
4 : And a chalice
4 : We have four of those showing too so I'll discard this one.
1 : We do.
3 : Mmhmm
3 : I think we just choose not to keep this one
2 : And then
3 : cause all we need is three treasures.
1 : Right exactly, that's why- Yeah.
4 : Yeah
4 : Thank you.
4 : Breaking Bridge.
3 : Breaking Bridge
4 : That's gone.
2 : Breaker's Bridge?
4 : Yeah, sorry
3 : Cool we don't need that one.
4 : Iron Gate
4 : Is that already gone?
3 : That one's gone
3 : right?
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok and Whispering Garden
3 : Mmhmm
2 : So then we have to pull another one?
3 : Is that
1 : Whispering Garden
4 : Yup
1 : But we had to toss the one cause it's already gone and flip this now.
3 : Yeah
4 : Oh wait a minute, Whispering Garden goes back cause that's not, that's not
1 : Yeah
1 : only discard the uh Iron Gate.
3 : Oh oh
4 : Ok
4 : And Temple of the Sun,
4 : which is now gone.
3 : (So you have to do it)
2 : Eh
1 : Yeah that
2 : Oh with one of the rocks
1 : that purple one's not happening.
2 : So now we gotta
4 : Yeah
2 : save that one.
1 : Yes but there should be
1 : three here though. Where's the third one?
4 : We had- Oh Iron Gate
4 : Iron Gate is the other one.
1 : Well this is the one that's already gone though
3 : Yeah
4 : It- Oh it is?
1 : With this is the one we replaced.
3 : Another one?
2 : Thought we alreaady
3 : We did three.
2 : did
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : We re- we replaced it already.
1 : So there was Whispering Gardens, which we had, there was Temple of the Sun, which we dumped
3 : Now that one's gone now
1 : That one's gone now.
3 : And then the third one we replaced.
1 : Ok
4 : Alright so if it's still showing on the board though, we put it back.
3 : Is that right?
3 : Yeah
4 : Correct
1 : Right
2 : Yes
3 : Yeah so we're good
2 : Yes
4 : So these are all gone?
1 : So Break- uh
4 : Breaker's
1 : Yeah
3 : Yes they're all gone
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah those three are gone, yeah yeah, ok
4 : Ok
1 : We're good.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : Uh that's, that's it for me.
1 : Alright so um
3 : Who are you next to?
4 : Oh
4 : crap you know what?
4 : Oh I can't do that until he gets on the chalice.
3 : Mmhmm
2 : He's with me
1 : Right
1 : um
1 : so we definitely needed
2 : Do you wanna give me some of your cards?
3 : We need to flip that guy
1 : We need to flip this guy for sure.
3 : Yeah, well you can flip two at once, I would do
4 : Do the Copper Gate
1 : Uh adjacent ones
1 : So I can do these two as one action if I want
3 : Mmhmm
3 : I would do that.
1 : And then
1 : ok
1 : I'm fine with that.
3 : Just cause we need to save that guy
1 : We definitely need to save this guy.
1 : And we might as well do this while we're at it.
4 : And that's a p- pathway.
3 : I think this is important also cause we don't want to isolate the fire.
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
1 : Um ok so
1 : does it make sense to-
2 : That was one action
1 : Correct.
3 : T minus seven and
3 : seven minutes forty seconds
1 : Yeah alright
2 : And then I think that you should give me
2 : either of these.
3 : I think so too.
2 : Because you're running out of space, yeah.
1 : A, a pair of them you mean? Yeah ok so how bout I give you a pair of them?
2 : So that's two actions
1 : A pair of the fire, correct.
3 : Yeah
4 : So that's
1 : And then
2 : And then
1 : Two of those please, thank you.
2 : (We are) two.
1 : Alright uh
1 : more purple rock and Helicopter Lift
3 : Nice
4 : Oh cool
3 : I have so many of those
2 : Ok and then you're
3 : We should start using them, probably.
1 : We probably should.
1 : Alright Temple of the Moon,
1 : Crimson Forest,
4 : Oh gone
1 : uh
3 : Ok buh bye
1 : That's alright, and Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : right there in the middle.
2 : That's alright.
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : Do you wanna give me the Crimson Forest card?
2 : Oh yeah
1 : Oh did we
1 : Oh is that- Oh that's gone for good. Right, right, right, right.
3 : Yeah now, yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok my turn
1 : Alright, cool.
2 : Ok so
2 : for my first action I'm going to give you my card
4 : K
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And then
1 : Hold on you can't have- Can she have
3 : Yeah cause that's her
4 : Oh I have to get rid of one.
1 : (--)
1 : Yeah
2 : Oh yeah so you have to give- get rid of
1 : Yeah
3 : the chalice.
2 : Yeah one of those.
4 : Mm
1 : Yeah I guess
3 : But we still have one, two, three, four in play.
4 : Yup
1 : We do
2 : And then um
2 : I should move or flip
3 : Can you sandbag this guy
1 : Yeah why don't we use the sandbags too, just
2 : Oh yeah
3 : Can we just do that, just right off the bat?
4 : Do we have a Whispering Garden?
4 : Garden (--)
4 : lurking in that pile.
1 : This one here?
4 : Yeah
1 : No
3 : I don't think we
1 : Oh no I'm sorry yes we do,
1 : we do.
2 : I do that one and should I just use my- the other one as my-
2 : Or should I start moving down since I have these two?
3 : Move
1 : I think hanging onto one is a good idea.
4 : Yeah I would hang on to one.
3 : Yeah I would move.
1 : Yeah so why don't you start- why don't you
2 : If I move
1 : start working down towards the fire and we'll see if I can get them to you somehow cause you can fly
2 : Should I move over since this one's flooded?
1 : We have enough to fly people around.
3 : Yeah
3 : I can fly you there.
1 : Yeah
1 : yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Let me fly you there.
4 : K
3 : Or do you just wanna be like right next door?
2 : Uh
2 : just put me there.
3 : Cause we haven't ha- We haven't pulled the Cave of Shadows- Oh do these ones
1 : Right
2 : Ok they- And then I still need
2 : three
3 : Do these ones first.
1 : Yeah the, the, those are the actions.
2 : Ok
1 : Hey look at that
2 : Oh
3 : Yes
4 : Oh
2 : Ok
4 : Yes so we captured that, right?
4 : Can we do that- Oh no, we have to wait.
2 : Uh I think I have to wait
1 : But eh, that's an action though, yeah that's an action. Ok so
3 : You have to wait, you have to wait. That's ok, we'll just, we'll just make sure you don't die in the mean time.
2 : Yeah I have to wait till my next turn so we, we gotta be quick.
4 : Yeah you have to wait
1 : Just don't move, don't breathe, don't do anything.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : Don't flood.
2 : Ok
2 : Oh crap, ok, so Silver Gate,
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah
2 : Copper Gate,
2 : and Tidal

3 : Ok
1 : Eh that's not too bad.
1 : Alright Pilot
2 : Alright Pilot
3 : Alright let's do this.
3 : Um
3 : we got less than four minutes
1 : Can you fly
3 : I can fly anywhere for fun.
2 : Um
3 : But I have nothing of value
1 : Right
2 : Can you flip the Tidal Place back over since that has our chalice on it?
3 : Yup
3 : One
2 : Um
1 : You wanna fly here just to keep her
1 : keep the
1 : the Explorer
3 : What if I do two and then I take us somewhere?
2 : And then fl-

3 : Where do you need to go green?
1 : Well the- Yeah that's fine.
3 : Three
1 : Ok
1 : that's fine.
4 : K
2 : Ok and then draw your cards
2 : and then you have to discard one
3 : Which one do I wanna get rid of the most?
2 : Get rid of the, li- the li- We don't need the lion.
3 : The lion
1 : Get rid of the fire
3 : Well the lion's gonna be gone right now.
1 : Oh actually well oh, oh
4 : Right, yup
1 : Yeah but (--), yeah same

3 : That's- Yeah
1 : Oh

4 : Yay
3 : Lion yay
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Now we take those out
4 : or put em back in there?
3 : I think we put em in here
4 : Capture treasure
4 : discarding four matching cards
3 : Yup, treasure discard pile, cool. Well one
1 : Gotcha
4 : K
4 : So we got that one
1 : Is that count as an action?
1 : Ok so that's one.
2 : Yes
3 : Yes
4 : Yes
3 : So that's one.
4 : Alright so now
3 : You gotta- We gotta save her.
1 : Right
3 : What can you do?
4 : Alright so I can move, I can move diagonally
3 : To
3 : K so that was one
1 : Well that's the same as moving
4 : So
4 : green.
3 : Fly her
4 : So if I go
3 : Fly her there.
1 : I can?
3 : Yes
3 : at any point in time.
1 : Ok so I- Does that mean my person takes you and we all three go there?
3 : Eh I don't know read your card
1 : Oh
1 : Uh move one or more players to the same tile
1 : No they have to be- you have to be on the same tile to start though. So I have to be on the same tile as she is
3 : Mm
2 : She can
2 : move to your tile and then- Well it won't matter cause then
1 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to
3 : No when the pi- when the pawns are on the same tile.
3 : You can do that at anytime
2 : But they're not on the same
2 : tile.
3 : We're on the same tile.
1 : I have
1 : Right but I'm not with you.
3 : We don't have to be, cause that's how I used that card before.
1 : Oh gotchu. Any, any pair- any- Ok.
3 : Yeah so, so, so if so if you're moving multiples than they have to be together.
1 : Ok gotchu
4 : So actually just move
3 : So I think we should move away from this gold, we don't need it anymore
1 : Ok, you wanna move, move both of you that direction?
4 : Right so
3 : Let it sink
4 : move both to this one.
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah and then- So that was
3 : Yeah so you only used one
1 : Right

2 : As the third action
3 : Yup
4 : Ok
4 : That's- Yeah alright
1 : (--) that's your

4 : No you have one more turn
1 : And I have one more turn

1 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : K
2 : Ok so um
2 : I guess I'll
2 : one move
2 : Shore up this one
2 : Um
2 : and
2 : would either of you want
2 : to start building up
4 : Uh
4 : No, I don't know, it's up to you.
2 : Um
3 : You don't have to take three actions
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok, uh
4 : And you can move yourself again if you want
2 : Yeah
4 : Like you could move yourself here if you wanted to
2 : Ok, I guess I'll just hang out there then

2 : (Uh)
2 : (that's)
2 : (--)
2 : yeah
2 : Uh Breaker's Bridge and Whispering Garden
3 : Ok

3 : guess
3 : I will
3 : go
3 : here
3 : cause I can fly
3 : um
3 : And shore this up
3 : Mm
4 : And then you can either
1 : That's bothering me
4 : do another move or you can just let that end
4 : and draw your cards.
1 : Yeah
3 : yeah
3 : I
3 : Um yeah, I'm going to
3 : draw my treasure cards
3 : which were here
3 : Ok

4 : damn
1 : I was gonna shore that up, dang it
3 : Uh
3 : (--)
4 : Ok, um
4 : Ok so
4 : I would
4 : I'm gonna move here
4 : and
4 : give this to you
2 : Thank you
4 : which is
4 : right, right? I can do that because we're both on the same card
3 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
1 : you can.
2 : So that's like two moves, I think then
4 : Yeah, so if I have one more if I want to but I don't really feel like doing anything so I'll take two of those
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Thank you
2 : Mmhmm
4 : And two of those.
4 : Thank you
4 : Oh ho ho, ok
4 : Temple of the Moon just got

3 : Right here
1 : Mm Silver Gate, there's Iron Gate.
4 : There we go
1 : Oh there's a Gold Gate
4 : That's it, I'm done.
1 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : I don't know what I want, I'm gonna
1 : shore up where I'm standing on
1 : and then shore this up so that's two moves.
4 : Oh no can't you shore up two up for one action?
1 : Yeah, but it has to be like two that are adjacent to me isn't it?
4 : Um
3 : The Engineer may shore up two tiles for one action
4 : Just two tiles per an action so
3 : The Explorer may also shore up tiles diagonally. You can do like, do do
1 : Oh well then it is one action
3 : do
3 : do
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
3 : And this because
1 : And it's all I wanna do
2 : Do you- Would it maybe be worth if you were to like move up here as a second move and then shore up that one as a third?
1 : Ooo yeah
1 : second move,
1 : third
1 : K
1 : No
2 : Oh
4 : Oh
4 : You ca-
1 : You're the only one that can do it diagonally
4 : I can only move diagonally- Oh yeah, I can shore up diagonally
2 : Ah
1 : Yeah you can do both. ok so I'll just stand th- I'll hang out.
1 : Can I have two of the
1 : I got a Water's Rise card
4 : Ah
1 : But I also got that
4 : That one's gonna for sure up Temple of the Moon soon especially cause we're just shuffling it
1 : Alright
1 : But then the
1 : I'm not very good at shuffling
1 : And then draw three now
1 : So I got Temple of the Moon, which you guys are on, Whispering Garden, and Iron Gate
1 : So Iron Gate has sunk also
3 : Oh yeah
1 : And Whispering Garden is now back to that
3 : Um so now you can
1 : So Temple of the Moon
3 : Move to anything right
4 : So we can move
3 : left, uh up, down
4 : Yeah
4 : So
4 : us two have to move immediately.
1 : Do you- Wait, do move
1 : on the your turn, or just immediately?
4 : Just immediately I think to get out of swimming
1 : k
3 : Yeah
1 : Yes
4 : Cause it's not an action, we just have to
1 : Oh yeah, it is an action is it?
4 : be on land.
4 : Um
4 : You cool if we both do both of us, both of us here?
2 : I think so, yeah
4 : Ok, your turn
2 : Ok, um, hmm hmm hmm hmm,
2 : I guess
2 : maybe I'll start moving forward in the hopes of going here.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Um
1 : How many- Do you wanna move one or
2 : One
3 : Or you can also move to Whispering Garden and then
4 : You can move
2 : And shore it up
3 : on yeah
2 : Yeah cause
2 : Ok, so that's three
2 : um
2 : alright now I need
2 : to discard one of these
4 : What'd you get?
3 : Um
2 : These two
2 : uh this was actually the most recent one so I guess I get rid of that
3 : Oh wait, but don't you wanna keep that cause yeah then you have four
4 : Well keep that, cause then you have four.
2 : Or
2 : Is it, is it, is it, I guess it's a- Is it a choice though? Cause it's- Ok
4 : Yeah,
4 : like you have five cards in your hand you can discard any one of them that you want.
3 : Like you can give that
2 : Ok
2 : cool
2 : one
2 : Two uh
1 : Yes or no
1 : Only have five. How many do you have right now?
1 : Oh you have six
2 : Um, oh I do, that's
3 : Your treasure and your special action
2 : Never mind
4 : Well no you can still keep that, yeah
1 : Don't give her that one, you can
1 : get rid of like the chalice or like the sandbags
2 : Yeah, that's a good point- Ok, I gotcha
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : I keep thinking it's like
2 : chronologically which one's I got
2 : Ok uh Cliffs of Abandon,
2 : Breaker's Bridge, and Gold Gate.
3 : No
1 : No
4 : No
2 : Mm
3 : Uh
1 : Hey this is not going well
3 : I don't know if there's any strategy to this but
1 : Ok, it's your turn now
3 : It is my turn, alright
3 : Um
1 : You could
4 : Ooo you should lift him
1 : As a suggestion you could fly him
3 : I
4 : Yeah
1 : to you.
3 : How does that exist?
4 : You could
3 : Once (--) fly- Oh just saying this, ok
1 : Oh wait, and you have, it's
4 : No yeah, you have to use a Helicopter Lift and you can
1 : Helicopter Lift
4 : Well wait can you lift anyone?
3 : Lift your teams off
1 : Helicopter Lift is required to leave the island.
3 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile.
3 : So yeah, I can just lift him over there but I can't lift anyone else or myself.
4 : Yeah that's because there's no one else on the
3 : and then
4 : card.
3 : And also that doesn't even count as an action so
1 : Use
1 : gray not green.
4 : Yeah so you can
3 : Ok so you're- What color are you?
1 : gray
4 : gray
3 : gray
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok so I
3 : will
3 : put you
4 : She'll have to just wait till this turn to do that
3 : put you
1 : We'll just have to make sure to keep
3 : there
1 : that safe.
3 : and
3 : I still have three more actions.
3 : Um I can
1 : Oh yeah we don't have any other
4 : (Oh you're gotta) just
3 : I can go here
3 : and
1 : Shore up
3 : also shore it up
3 : so that's only two actions
2 : Mmhmm
3 : and um
1 : You have to get rid of your Helicopter Lift card
4 : Yeah
3 : Yes
3 : Uh
3 : I don't think
3 : I could fly to another tile but I don't know what the purpose would be. Ok yeah I'm just gonna
4 : You don't have to if you don't feel like doing anything else.
3 : chill there and now
2 : And then
3 : draw
3 : three of these.
1 : Do your treasure cards first.
3 : The treasure cards first, is what I meant.
4 : Mmhmm
2 : I, I also think there's a limit that you can only fly once per
1 : There's three, you're supposed to only do two.
3 : Once per
2 : I think
1 : You have three, or were we supposed to pick two?
4 : Two
3 : So sorry
3 : Ok
3 : treasures
1 : Oh
3 : Um
4 : Keep it (fine)
4 : And then two- three of your
3 : Right
2 : I can
3 : Oh
3 : if you
3 : y-
3 : Nn
1 : Oh I should probably
3 : Thank you
3 : Copper Gate,
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : Howling Garden.
1 : Nn, mm, mm, I didn't know where it was.
4 : Oh thank god
1 : K
3 : Ok
4 : Ok, so um I was thinking
4 : that
4 : I would
4 : hmm.
3 : I think it's important to make sure we keep shoring up, especially places where there's like, where we need to get the treasure from
1 : Get a (civil) card
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Um
3 : Which aren't any of these specifically but like that one- You're not anywhere near that one, but um
4 : Mmhmm
4 : And also- Also I was thinking, she
4 : You already have
4 : two of those.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : But we're very far from those cards
1 : Yeah
3 : I have two as well
4 : Because I have to move away from- I have to like land on you to give you the card anyways
3 : I have two as well so
1 : I mean I could just slowly move that way
3 : But you're the Mess-
4 : You're
3 : Wait
3 : You're the Messenger? No
4 : I'm the Explorer
3 : Who's the Messenger?
1 : I think maybe
3 : You're the Messenger.
2 : I'm the Messenger, yeah
4 : And you're Pilot right, so
3 : Give treasure cards to player anywhere on the island for one action per
1 : yeah you should probably give it to her cause she can fly wherever she wants to.
4 : Yeah, there we go
1 : And then I'll give one to her next turn.
4 : So if I can move
4 : Well I can move this way
4 : I can give you this card. That doesn't take an ap- action right? Giving you the card
1 : Yes it does
4 : It does?
3 : Well, I mean, technically you don't even need to give me that
2 : I think
3 : Well
1 : Yeah because
1 : We should go it too cause you can fly anywhere
3 : I mean because we need four.
1 : Yeah and then I'll give you
3 : You have two already
1 : I'll give you one next card,
4 : Mmhmm. She can use two turns to get to you too. She has to be on the same card as you, so like
1 : next turn.
3 : Ok
1 : I'll just do a pair and give it to you
3 : But now I have to discard a card
4 : I did that
1 : Oh
4 : Yeah but you can discard, you can discard one of these if you wanted since
1 : Yeah so it's
1 : None of us really have that many
3 : So go two
4 : Yeah none of us have that anyways.
3 : So
3 : I'll do this.
1 : So you should probably do the air one since you already have two in next.
2 : NnMm
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Eh
1 : If we
1 : get any.
4 : I shored that. So that was three actions right? I moved one, I gave her a card, I shored up a card.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yes
4 : Awesome.
4 : I'll take two of those
1 : We're done.
4 : Water's Rise
1 : Hmm yay
4 : Ok, Water's Rise
1 : Legendary
4 : I mean you can shuffle em up and put em on top.
1 : (I guess)
4 : And then I discard this
1 : What was the next one you have with the (--) one?
4 : I just got a thing but no one needs it anyway.
1 : He already has that so we can
2 : Mmhmm three
4 : And then three flood cards, oh god
4 : Whispering Gardens,
4 : Howling Gardens,
3 : Oh
1 : Aw
4 : and Breaker's Bridge.
4 : Here
1 : Here it is
4 : We are sinking faster than Atlantis
3 : Ok we definitely need to get the Whispering Garden one because it's the only one we have left with that
1 : We really need to protect these two, the only two left
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
4 : Ok, you're turn
1 : My turn
1 : I'm going to
1 : move here,
4 : You
1 : yes
3 : Or
1 : No
3 : Don't you wanna
4 : You gotta take two turns to go there cause you can't- Can you move diagonally?
1 : I can't move diagonally, I cannot
3 : But
4 : So yeah you can take turns, you can go one, two if you wanted
3 : Well don't you,
3 : don't you wanna maybe shore up the Whispering Garden one?
1 : I wanna give you a card though.
3 : Um ok
4 : Well can't you shore up a- Uh you can shore up oh two tiles never mind, I don't know what I'm talking about.
1 : Mmhmm and it doesnt' count as
2 : Um I think, I think it might be more important to shore it up first and then
3 : To shore up, yeah because if it's gone, then it's gone.
1 : Ok I'll shore up and then I'll just move there. Don't move.
3 : Ok
1 : That's me, ok, good.
1 : Two of those
1 : Please
1 : K I got
1 : this guy and Helicopter Lift so I have to get rid of. I have one, two, three, four
3 : Get rid of the chalice
3 : is that what that is?
1 : Chalice. So I have five now.
4 : Yeah
1 : Ok
1 : Here you go
4 : And then three Forbidden Island cards
1 : then
4 : Ooo fingers crossed.
3 : The only thing that we'll lose is Crimson Forest, yup.
1 : Guys I feel like Crimson Forest is- yeah Crimson Forest is gone.
1 : That was also Copper Gate, oh my god
1 : and Cliffs of Abandon.
4 : Oh we're all standing on it.
1 : Ah
1 : We need to shore that up soon.
3 : Yeah especially because it's close to Fool's Landing.
4 : Ok, Messenger.
2 : Ok so my first move is to cash these in.
4 : Does that count?
2 : Uh I think that's one move.
1 : Yeah it is.
4 : Yeah
3 : And you if you discard four
4 : Mmhmm it is.
2 : Uh discard cards to the treasure card discard pile and move the (--) in front of you, so I'll take that.
3 : (--)
2 : Um
2 : front of you, so I'll take that.
4 : Ok, so that's one action of yours
2 : Yeah, is there any other
4 : Um
4 : you c-
4 : oh
4 : wait
4 : oh never mind. For some reason I thought Fool's Landing was already gone. I was like hold on
2 : I
1 : Wait, is sandbags count as a move?
4 : What?
1 : It doesn't right?
4 : No, it's a special card so
3 : Um
1 : You could use it on Cliffs of Abandon
3 : Technically we don't even really have to worry about
1 : since we're all there.
3 : like
3 : kee- keeping that, like shoring that up again if it's not anywhere near Fool's Landing and we already have the
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, I might wanna hold on to this just in case one of the other ones uh gets in trouble, so maybe that's it?
1 : Ok
1 : Yeah
3 : But, do you, do you have to be on
4 : Mmhmm
3 : on the
4 : Temple Side? No he can move somewhere if he wants to.
3 : I mean
2 : Yeah, I mean maybe I'll go up two and
1 : Hang out with us
2 : Yeah, we'll
3 : Uh
3 : Mm
2 : Uh
3 : Oh darn it. Ok
3 : never mind, just kidding.
2 : Ok
1 : Oh
2 : Uh, Cave of Embers,
3 : So
2 : Silver Gate,
2 : and Dunes of Deception.
1 : Ok
1 : Silver Gate and Dunes of t-Deception.
3 : Hmm Dunes of Deception.
4 : Ok, your turn.
3 : Ok
4 : Hopefully Water Rise doesn't- I say you should shore up on Cliffs of Abandon anyways, because if we get a Water's- if you draw a Water's Rise card it'll go back right into the shuffle.
3 : I think
3 : Yeah
3 : um
3 : also I was thinking maybe it would be pretty important to fly here and then also shore that up because it's the only
3 : No there's only two of those
3 : Yeah, maybe shore that up.
4 : Well that would be three moves if you shored this, flied here, and then shored that.
3 : Yeah, I'll take that.
1 : Yeah and then
1 : I think for my move, so I can give you th-things
2 : Uh
4 : Oh no, you have to stand on the same thing
3 : Well are you gonna s-
2 : Um could you exchange a card, um dis-
3 : I don't
1 : I think it has to be my turn
3 : I think it has to be her turn to give it to me and then
2 : Ok that's
1 : So I think for my turn, like I know that your turn's next but I think I might go here and then shore these up and then- Oh wait no, that'd be three wouldn't it?
4 : Or no how bout this. If she shored this and then
3 : came here and then shored this up, waited here for her
1 : Yes
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : and then I'll just come here,
1 : come over and give it to you.
4 : And then you can give the card, and then she'll just have to wait another round.
4 : Only like one more turn before she
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok cool
3 : volunteer
1 : (Shorin' it up)
3 : Woohoo
3 : Uh
3 : And now draw two treasure (decks) right?
1 : Mm
3 : Um
1 : Thank God
3 : I think I'm just gonna discard both of these
3 : Wait cause
4 : Well you can keep one
3 : No I already have five
4 : Oh
4 : there we go.
1 : Yeah just cause
1 : Discard
3 : Um and then three of those
1 : (--)
3 : and
3 : Tidal Palace is
3 : is right here
4 : oh
3 : and Bronze Gate
3 : (which way)
3 : (it's right here)
3 : and Coral Palace.
3 : This guy
3 : Um
3 : technically speaking I think uh if we just let this guy go as long as we keep that one
3 : so that on your turn maybe shore that up
2 : Sure
3 : and if that goes away it's uh
3 : it's ok cause we already have another place to
1 : Mmhmm
3 : cushion that.
3 : Um (--)
4 : (moves)
1 : Yeah and plus
4 : Ok, we're already making moves to get
4 : the fire stone right?
1 : Yeah
3 : Right, and I think
4 : Then we needa make
3 : So we're gonna make, we're gonna try to get this and then this will be our next goal.
1 : moves to get this.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
4 : Uh, what color are you, red?
1 : I'm red.
4 : Ok
4 : You wanna give me one or should I give you one?
4 : how's this gonna work?
1 : I can't give you one right now
3 : Um
1 : and if I
4 : Well if I give you one
1 : If I
3 : I just need one more
4 : Yeah you can get rid of one
1 : Ok yeah
1 : Oh you know on your turn you can give me that
1 : Oh I have to get- I'll give her a Helicopter Lift though
1 : You only need one more fire?
4 : Yeah, so you can get rid of one fire. Keep the Helicopter Lift just in case
3 : Yeah I need one more fire
1 : Yeah, here
3 : Yeah
4 : Um
4 : so that's one turn.
1 : Ok
4 : and then
3 : Your next turns need to be to go to where I am
3 : right?
1 : Mm me, I need to
4 : No I don't need to. She needs to
3 : No
3 : you- Yeah, right.
2 : Um you
2 : Uh you can also, you can give a second card as a second move if we wanted to load up on
4 : Mmhmm
4 : but then she'd have to move away from that.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : (--) from her.
4 : Oh but if you did then you could use a Helicopter Lift
1 : You could
4 : to get to her because she already has- She's already saving a Helicopter Lift.
3 : But how many
1 : Ha ha
4 : We only need one to get to Fool's Landing, and all we're close to Fool's Landing as it is.
1 : Yeah so
1 : She give it to me
1 : that would be two turns for you and then I would
1 : go here
3 : Um
1 : that would be all one turn
3 : Should
4 : But you have to get rid of a card. We can't do that. Never mind.
1 : and then
3 : Just
1 : K
3 : Very quickly, um
1 : No it's good.
3 : We might wanna, wait, ok we actually don't care about this one right? We just wanna get- Cause we only need three treasures.
4 : Yeah
1 : Shore this up.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok so if
3 : any of those go it's alright we can like figure it out
1 : So you have
4 : You know what, I can move and or shore up diagonally.
3 : Alright
1 : You could shore up
1 : poral
1 : Coral Palace, not Poral Calace
3 : Well, technically we don't really need to worry about any of these that are
1 : On the outside?
3 : what they are right now, because we can still get to Fool's Landing
1 : We just wanna keep Fool's Landing safe
3 : and also
4 : No but we should shore up this because it's next to Fool's Landing and if
1 : Yeah
4 : If you're here
3 : Right, but we can always use a Helicopter- She has one and I have one, as long as we have
3 : one to get us all out.
1 : one left
1 : We should still shore up though
1 : like
3 : maybe yeah.
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Well I mean that's one turn for me
1 : Cause that's one
1 : thing for you.
4 : And then
3 : Wait, aren't you green?
4 : I am but I can shore anything diagonally or around me.
1 : She's right the-
3 : Oh ok
1 : adjacently.
4 : Um
3 : So that's one move.
1 : Everyone can shore up adjacently.
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah, I can- I'm the only one who can shore up diagonally. And then I have one more turn.
4 : So
4 : we are not doing this thing where I'm moving here?
4 : You're moving here?
1 : Uh
3 : Cause she still
1 : I'll go
1 : uh cause if I, if I move here and then I fly here
1 : Wait no
4 : If ok- If I move here
1 : Yeah if I move here and then isn't
4 : And then you also move there
1 : But I have to cap- I move there, and then I have to capture a treasure.
4 : But you don't even have the card yet cause I can't give it to you
4 : cause
1 : I know
4 : We're just gonna wait till the next round for that whole plan to work.
1 : Yes
4 : Until you get rid of that fire card.
1 : Ok, I'll just- I have to give her this.
4 : Yeah, so then I think I'm done.
3 : Ok
4 : And I'm just gonna take
4 : two of those
4 : I betcha there's a Water- Oh thank god
1 : Oh no what time did we start?
4 : Ok
4 : and then three of these.
1 : mm
4 : Watchtower,
4 : Misty Marsh,
4 : Temple of the Sun.
1 : Oh
1 : those are fine to
1 : have happen.
3 : Yeah
4 : Ok, your turn.
1 : Ok so I'm going to
1 : Should I Helicopter Lift to her or should I just
1 : Does Helicopter Lift card- count as a move?
4 : No
3 : I would say maybe save that- Oh ok
2 : Mm
2 : Mm
1 : I'm gonna save it, yeah
3 : (We could test) do you really need it if you just go one move and then one move
4 : And then give her the card
3 : and then give the card that's three.
1 : Yeah ok wait
3 : Yes
1 : so
3 : (So do you get to (--))
1 : One,
3 : Two
1 : two, that's two moves.
1 : Here you go.
3 : And then three, thank you. And then I'll dispose of
3 : this
4 : Yeah, you can dispose of that cause I have one
1 : Dispose of it, she has one.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Ok and t-can I have two
1 : Oh wait,
1 : is it your turn? It's my turn.
4 : Yeah
1 : K
4 : Ha ha
4 : ha ha
4 : Shuffle well.
1 : At least I got two of those now
4 : Shuffle well
1 : I will- hey wait where does this go? It goes there.
1 : (--)
1 : There it is.
1 : Now the stuff that's flooded now is real important but I also don't wanna sink anything.
4 : Same
1 : Come on
1 : ok
1 : I got Cave of Embers,
1 : which we're standing on
4 : But it'll be fixed soon enough.
1 : Coral Palace, and Tidal Palace. Tidal Palace is gone.
3 : And that's ok.
4 : That does not matter.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok, so I think, um
2 : I should probably move
2 : over
2 : up
2 : and shore up?
2 : maybe.
4 : Yeah
4 : You could
1 : Yeah
1 : that's a good idea.
3 : Mm
4 : Yeah
4 : and then you're still close to Fool's Landing.
1 : Just stay here because
2 : Yeah
1 : that'd be
2 : One, two,
3 : Ok
1 : Done
3 : That's good
2 : Alright
2 : Uh Breaker's Bridge
1 : Where is that?
2 : Oh, maybe that's already sunk.
1 : It's already sunk, oh whoops.
4 : Oh no then why is the card still in there?
1 : Just take it
4 : Oh well
4 : (--)
2 : Uh Dunes of Deception is now gone
4 : I think you draw a card another one anyways then
1 : Beautiful.
2 : And Bronze Gate
1 : Bronze Gate is gone.
3 : Hm
3 : Ok
2 : is also gone.
1 : Oh my home is gone.
4 : Do you still have to draw another card because the one card that you drew was already gone?
3 : Uh
1 : probably
4 : Another flood card
3 : I don't know about that.
4 : (What do you mean) that was like a scrub of ours in the first place so
3 : I, I don't know if that's actually in the
1 : Yes
1 : yes draw another card- Ok yes, she said draw another card.
4 : Yeah
1 : Here
3 : Ok
2 : Copper Gate.
3 : Ok, that's also ok.
4 : And that's gone as well.
4 : Ok
4 : your turn.
4 : Go, go, go.
4 : Capture
3 : Ok so
3 : I'm already there.
3 : So I guess I can turn these in
3 : and
3 : Do I put em in here or do I put em in here?
4 : No you put em in there
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok so we have this and that counts as one
4 : Mmhmm
3 : move right?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : And so I guess I can fly
3 : here and move it
3 : (--)
1 : Shore it
3 : Unless you wanna do that one?
4 : Do that one because
3 : Just in case
4 : Yeah because I have this
4 : Just in case this doesn't work out.
3 : Ok
3 : So one,
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah you could give it to that
1 : him
3 : two,
3 : three.
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Ooo wait you're
3 : Huh
3 : Huh
1 : Nothing, I'm talking to myself, I'm sorry.
3 : And then so draw two of these
3 : sandbags.
3 : (--)
3 : Um
3 : do you wanna shore anything up at this time?
4 : Mm
1 : Not really
3 : I don't think any of these things are radically important.
1 : Maybe Watchtower
3 : Um
4 : If you really want to. Nah
1 : But not really.
1 : Yeah, not really.
4 : Ok so then three
3 : Well
3 : ok.
3 : And
3 : yeah
4 : Oh well at least we know that, what's it called?
4 : Fool's Landing isn't gonna come anytime soon because it's at the bottom of the deck.
3 : Yeah
3 : Ok Misty Marsh, that's gone.
1 : Thank god
3 : The Temple of the Sun is
3 : gone.
4 : Do I need that? No
3 : And
3 : Watchtower is gone.
3 : Ok
3 : Wait, those were all gone? Wow.
3 : Ok
4 : Ok then, um
1 : Alright
4 : I'm going
4 : Oh I have to be next to you
4 : to give you this card.
1 : I mean you could just move
4 : Yeah
1 : one, two and then give it to me.
1 : Thank you
1 : And then I'll get rid of my Helicopter Lift because I already have two of em.
4 : Oh and then I have to draw two cards.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Thank you
4 : Wonderful
4 : And then three of those
4 : do do choo chooo
4 : We're sinking fast. The Observatory,
4 : Silver Gate,
4 : Gone
1 : Mmhmm
1 : That's dead.
4 : Gates of Abandon, Uh oh.
3 : No wait
2 : Was that- I think that one we just needed to flip.
1 : No, that wasn't flipped.
3 : That wasn't, that was
4 : or cliffs
3 : Yeah
4 : Oh that was flipped- Oh thank god, cause then we would be- No way to get to that.
3 : (--)
1 : You could get to it.
4 : Oh
3 : You could fly
4 : yeah, there you go.
1 : But I need to get to it.
3 : But
4 : Ok
4 : your turn.
1 : Ok so
4 : This?
3 : Yeah, because it was just uh
4 : Oh, right, right, right, cause I just flipped it over.
1 : Oh yeah
1 : Ah
1 : Ok so I'm gonna- This doesn't count as a move?
1 : Yes, no?
4 : It
4 : doesn't.
3 : It does
4 : It doesn't but I think you should just use
3 : not count as an action.
1 : Does not count as an action
4 : I think if you did one two
4 : Oh no you have to get to here
1 : I can get to here
3 : Um
1 : using this
4 : No you'd only get to here- Oh no, using the Helicopter Lift, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : I can fly where ever the heck I want
1 : Yeah
1 : K, that's gone
1 : I will
3 : That's- So that's not a move?
1 : That's not a move. So this is
3 : Ok so you can also flip
3 : the Cliffs of
1 : Yeah that's what I was gonna do.
3 : of Abandon. Ok, awesome.
1 : Ok
2 : Um
1 : Yes
2 : let's see so ok oh- If you- That's one move is to get the treasure. Um if you wanted to could you just hop one, two and then you're even closer.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Um
4 : To Fool's Landing?
3 : Well
3 : I mean
4 : Rather than shoring this up
1 : Rather than shoring it up
3 : But don't
2 : Because in
1 : Cause if that sinks, then I mean, we already did this.
4 : It doesn't matter, yeah, you're already out of- Just get close to
1 : So
1 : one move
1 : one, two
1 : and I'm back.
4 : Yeah
1 : We're good.
3 : Ok
1 : Oh yes
1 : No
4 : No
1 : I don't need you, go away.
1 : It's up to four
4 : We're so close to- We have like eight minutes left.
4 : Btdubs people
1 : Ah yes
1 : Oh ok
1 : Let's see which one of these goes
1 : I should probably do it upside down
4 : Wait how did
3 : Don't you still have to draw four?
1 : Yeah, after I shuffle all of them I'm gonna draw four.
3 : And
3 : we shuffled four and we have to draw four, it doesn't even matter to shuffle.
1 : I mean
1 : yes, I don't know why I did that.
3 : No, I mean that's the rules
1 : Ok
4 : Mm
1 : Ok, Cliffs of Abandon,
4 : I'm taking the Observatory
1 : thank god,
2 : That one's gone.
3 : Ooo
1 : is dead
1 : Um
4 : I'll take that card as well
1 : Yes
1 : Coral Palace and Cave of Embers
3 : Oh my goodness
1 : Great
3 : Ok, so
1 : We're getting really close.
4 : Ok, that's not that bad
3 : We actually can like just
3 : hop on that Fool's Landing guys, pretty soon.
4 : Just hop to it
1 : You need to
1 : to him
4 : And I can, yeah
2 : Ok, so I'm just gonna do that. Um
3 : S-
3 : Um
1 : But you're
1 : Coral palace
3 : Do
3 : Do you wanna maybe try saving this one so
3 : she can get over
1 : Why sh-
3 : in- like in case I'm
2 : Do- Um
4 : Well he can't because it's diagonal and
2 : Oh
4 : So this is your piece right here
2 : (--)
2 : That's right, yes,
2 : my colors.
1 : You can, you can flip it right now.
4 : And plus it doesn't matter because
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah so I'll just flip this one and then move down one.
3 : Ok
3 : that's good.
2 : by that
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
4 : And plus we don't need to wory about the
4 : ocean's chalice cause we already have three.
3 : Yeah
3 : And we just need to make sure to have one Helicopter Lift
1 : Oh but if this sinks
1 : that's not good.
4 : Well he can move
1 : Can you shore that up still? You already did, you only did one-
1 : two things.
3 : Well, actually if this sinks then you get to move like
1 : Yeah but
3 : then you swim to the
1 : Oh we already have three, never mind.
3 : nearest
2 : Um ok, so there's only three to draw from here
4 : What do we do if there's only three cards? Do you just draw those three?
1 : Yeah
1 : shuffle it.
4 : Oh
2 : Ok
1 : Shuffle your two cards.
4 : And then draw four.
2 : Ok
2 : underneath (underneath?) ok.
4 : Put it underneath.
3 : Mystery
4 : huh
2 : Uh ok Coral Palace
1 : You're swimming
2 : Um
3 : Ok
1 : with the fishes.
2 : Fool's Landing, uh oh.
3 : Oh
1 : That isn't good.
4 : Well we can still fly out of here if it's not sunk
2 : Um Twilight Hollow
2 : and Cave of Shadows.
1 : T-
1 : Cave of Shadows doesn't even matter.
3 : Ok
1 : Five cards in your hand.
3 : Alright
4 : You gotta get rid of a card.
2 : Oh, I keep
3 : Yeah
4 : You wanna sandbag something?
2 : I keep forgetting that that's
4 : Oh you have to get rid of it.
4 : Oh but you can get rid of a
2 : Uh
3 : Uh
1 : You can get rid of any of these
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : cause we don't need em anymore.
3 : Ok
3 : alright, three actions, I'm going to
3 : just go ahead and flip this one and
3 : cause I'm already there, also flip this one.
3 : I think that's all we need to do, right?
3 : Ok
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Well
1 : We just need to move back, don't use your Helicopter.
3 : um
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Oh well so I can have all those (--) six.
3 : Um and then
3 : I guess four of those
1 : Mm
3 : so all
3 : of them
1 : All of them
4 : Oh god
3 : Um
3 : Cave of Embers,
3 : Twilight Hollow,
3 : Cave of Shadows is gone
3 : and Fool's Landing again.
4 : I need Cave of Shembers, uh Shadows card.
1 : Or is it Whispering Garden
4 : Uh oh, uh we screwed up again
1 : Oh that's probably- We probably did
1 : the Cave of
1 : the Cliffs of Abandon. We probably mixed em up.
4 : Probably
4 : That's ok, we'll just keep continuing
3 : Um
1 : Mmhmm
3 : No I think that was right.
2 : goodbye
3 : Wait what?
4 : No cause there should be, there's
4 : there should
3 : Oh I see what you're saying
4 : There should be one more card in the
4 : deck but that's ok, we'll just keep going.
4 : Um my turn, so
4 : I'm going to
3 : deck
3 : Yeah
4 : shore this
3 : and
4 : um
3 : I would say just
1 : You could literally just shore
3 : move
4 : move this and shore this.
4 : And that's three cards
3 : Beautiful.
4 : Just in case something happens to you.
1 : And it's
1 : Yes
3 : And you don't actually have a
4 : Oh yeah
1 : What?
1 : I don't actually have a what?
3 : Do you have a
3 : I was
4 : Can I like get rid of this card?
4 : or do I have to play it?
1 : What is it?
4 : I have to play this card, don't I?
1 : You (don't) have to get rid of a card also
3 : Water's Rise.
1 : Ah yes
3 : Um I was asking for you about the Helicopter Lift
1 : Me
3 : because you're the next we could
1 : No, don't- We have to use the Helicopter Lift to get out.
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah but she has two anyways so
1 : Don't-
1 : Aha
3 : No what I was saying was
4 : Ok, here it goes. Cave of Embers
3 : Um
4 : out.
1 : Yes
4 : Fool's Landing,
4 : flooded.
4 : Twilight Hollow,
4 : Uh oh.
4 : Sunk.
1 : Sunk?
1 : No, no it's just
3 : No it's, no you're- Yeah it's just a blue
4 : Oh no
3 : looking card
1 : Mm
1 : I'm not dead.
3 : I think it was
4 : Oh right, there we are
1 : Yeah, give me these.
3 : I don't- Was it right here or was it right here?
4 : It was right above it.
1 : Wow
3 : Ok
1 : It's my t-
3 : Um so
4 : Oh and then get rid of this card
1 : Yes and it's my turn
3 : I would say definitely um
1 : What?
3 : Make that
4 : Yeah just and you can just move that right?
1 : I could just
4 : Yeah but you can just
3 : Yeah
1 : move there and then shore up both of them.
4 : Oh we have to wait all the way until her turn, don't we now?
4 : to fly out.
1 : Yeah it's not that bad though
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
1 : You don't have to do anything, you don't
1 : Ok that's all.
1 : You can just say I don't want to do anything.
1 : I don't need these.
1 : And then
1 : the two that are left.
1 : Fool's Landing and Twilight Hollow again
1 : I don't know what cards these are (--)
2 : Ok so uh I'm going to
4 : Don't they both go in the discarded pile?
1 : You don't have to do anything- No
2 : Should I- I'm just gonna shore this up
4 : Oh yeah, yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Yup
2 : Uh
2 : huh
1 : that's a good plan.
2 : Ah
2 : Ok, I'll discard that
1 : You got two minutes
2 : that
2 : Um
2 : Twilight Hollow's gone, Fool's Landing is flipped
1 : (both)
1 : And get us out of here.
4 : (--) get us out of here.
3 : Alright
3 : so
3 : Ok, the-
3 : I don't know what action, how do we
4 : And that's it
1 : We're done?
4 : End of game
3 : Yeah
3 : So
1 : Yay

4 : Ok
2 : Alrighty
1 : So I'm the Engineer, I must begin.
4 : Yes
2 : Mmhmm
2 : So you wanna
2 : do up to three of the actions
2 : You're on Bronze Gate
4 : Mm
2 : Mm
2 : Do you wanna put your cards out so we know what we have and we can-
1 : Oh, sure.
4 : Yeah
4 : Oh
4 : That makes that easier
2 : Cool,
2 : that's nice.
3 : Ok
4 : Alright
1 : So I have to make a move (--) one of this,
1 : one of these.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : You can, yeah
4 : Mm
1 : Can I go over here?
2 : Or you can-
2 : Nope, you can't move diagonally.
4 : No you can't
1 : Oh diagonally. I can move over here but I'll be in, I'll be flooded.
4 : Well you could
4 : right, you can move to a flooded one. And you could move over here but you'd have to take one action for this and then one action
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Wait, can I move to a flooded area?
4 : to there.
3 : Yeah, and you could flip it if you want.
4 : Yes you can.
1 : Oh I can?
4 : Yes.
3 : That counts as an action.
1 : I thought it was, I thought it was over.
4 : Nah,
1 : Oh
4 : as long as there's a tile there, you're fine.
1 : oh
4 : If the tile dissapears, then you're swimming.
2 : Yeah
2 : so shoring up might be a good idea just so that we definitely have that path and it
1 : Oh
2 : this doesn't get sunk, cause that's important.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
3 : so you could do-
3 : You have three actions right, so you could do, like one, you could move here and then
3 : shore up
3 : and that would be two
3 : Wait do we have three or four?
3 : No three
2 : Yeah
1 : So once I move I gotta turn the card over?
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Well you don't have to but
2 : That would be two separate things.
3 : it would be wise.
4 : Yeah
1 : Do you care as to where I move to?
2 : Nnhmm
2 : I mean, I think right now I would- the best
3 : Any of the, any of the flooded ones
1 : That's the one I was thinking about because Temple,
1 : I feel like I need some religion
2 : Yeah
2 : And
2 : these are valuable because
2 : you need to
2 : be on one of these in order to collect a treasure.
4 : Right
3 : Good point.
2 : So
2 : like
4 : Mmhmm
2 : anything that has these icons, that have the treasure on them, like this,
2 : you'd have to be on this one to collect this treasure.
4 : Right
4 : Our most important ones are the ones with the icons and also
4 : anything around
2 : Fool's Landing
3 : Yeah
4 : Yes
4 : because then we always need a way to get back there. So these two are our most important-
2 : Right
2 : I think the-
4 : two important ones to
2 : mmhmm
2 : Mmhmm
4 : shore up.
2 : Nice
2 : Mm
1 : And I turn the card over?
2 : Yeah, you wanna shore that one up
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
1 : And as I shore it up
1 : I still keep my piece on it?
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : And you have one more action
2 : right?
4 : So either can-, you can either use one more action and shore that up, which you don't have to move to it
4 : or
4 : you can
4 : not
4 : do anything.
4 : It's up to you
4 : We don't have to do three things everytime.
1 : What would make you happy?
2 : eh
1 : What makes everybody else happy if I make a move
3 : I think it would be good to shore that one up
2 : Me too, yeah.
4 : Yes, I think
3 : since you have the ability to.
2 : And it's- Yeah, it's close to this.
3 : You don't have to
4 : You don't have to move.
3 : Yeah
2 : You can shore up adjacent things
3 : Cause that would take up a tu-
4 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
2 : You can shore up like stuff that's next to you. Yeah
4 : So either one of those, yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Cause that's fine because I can do diagonals
2 : Mmhmm
4 : so
2 : Cool, yeah.
3 : That's good
4 : Ok
2 : Alright
4 : And now it's two
3 : So, Messenger
2 : Now me.
4 : Wait no, we have to do two treasure
2 : Oh yeah.
2 : So you take two of these guys
2 : so
2 : we got that Water's Rise
2 : so with that
2 : we need to move this up one level
2 : hmm.
4 : And that gets discarded
2 : Oh
2 : do we have to um shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top.
4 : Yes
4 : we do.
2 : Yeah, it's on the poster right behind. So
4 : Yes
2 : I'll kinda just shuffle this up a little bit
4 : We need to flip that over this way.
2 : doo doo
2 : Place it on top.
2 : Cool, ok
4 : Mmhmm
4 : And then we'll discard that
4 : card over onto that
2 : Yeah
3 : And then you have to draw
4 : area.
3 : right?
3 : Draw two
4 : Thr-
4 : Yeah
4 : Two
3 : Water's Rise
2 : Uh, yeah two of these.
3 : So, Temple of the Moon and Phantom Rock. So Temple of the Moon is this one so you would
2 : ok
3 : flood that one and flood
4 : Good thing you shored it up or it would've dissapeared.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : And where's Phantom's- Oh, here, I can do it.
4 : That one
4 : goes away.
3 : Oh
3 : yeah.
3 : And then we take that card with it, right?
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Is that a good thing, that they go away?
2 : Nnhmm
3 : No
4 : No
2 : No, because that means
3 : But luckily that one's on the end
2 : Yeah.
4 : Cause the island is trying to kill us
4 : off.
3 : It's like a self destructing island.
2 : We're gonna drown.
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
4 : So it's us versus the island.
1 : Ok
4 : So
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
4 : Alright, then that's the whole turn so now it's your turn.
3 : So
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : Messenger
2 : um
2 : let's see, what do I wanna do?
2 : I guess I'm gonna
2 : shore this up.
4 : Mm
3 : You could
2 : Mm
2 : Maybe I should move?
3 : You could move to that one,
3 : shore it up and then shore that one.
2 : Yeah
2 : Yeah,
2 : good idea.
2 : So that's three things.
3 : Yeah
2 : I think that's a good move.
2 : That's it, right?
3 : Um, and then don't you have to draw
2 : Yeah
4 : Yes
2 : Yup
4 : Then you have to draw two
3 : Yup, draw two treasure cards
2 : Ok
2 : So I got
2 : this
2 : and that.
3 : And then
4 : Ok
2 : Two of these.
3 : draw a flood card, yup.
4 : Two flood
2 : Two of them, right?
3 : Yup
1 : The (--) that's in my hand can I put down, can I put it down?
2 : Yeah, mmhmm
4 : Yeah
1 : Oh, ok
2 : So
2 : Cliffs of Abandon,
2 : flooded again.
2 : And Breaker's Bridge, where is that?
2 : Ok
2 : right
3 : Then
2 : that's it right?
4 : That's it
3 : Oh you don't have to do that cause you don't have a flood card.
2 : Yeah
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : So it's my turn.
2 : Yup
3 : Um
2 : Alright
3 : I am here
2 : so you're blue.
3 : Ok
2 : cool.
3 : Um
2 : Interesting
3 : If you want I could,
3 : I can fly anywhere, so I could go here,
3 : and I could get-
3 : Actually, I could go here
2 : Yeah, I think that might be smart.
3 : and then I could get that one and that one.
2 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
3 : And flying does not count as an action
3 : No, it is an action.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : But I think that's smart, cause we really don't wanna
2 : cause otherwise, like if those, like if this goes away, then we're gonna have to like go all the way around.
3 : Actually, technically that's not (--)
4 : Yeah
3 : It's just a move, but it doesn't matter
4 : Mm
3 : Um
2 : Oh yeah
3 : and then so
3 : These two.
2 : Ok so that's three things
4 : K
2 : Alright
2 : and
3 : And then I draw two of these
2 : mmhmm
3 : And
3 : two flood cards
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Got Gold Gate and Lost Lagoon,
2 : Uh oh, so this is sunk
3 : K
2 : another one on the end, that's cool.
3 : Lost Lagoon
3 : that is also gone.
4 : that's go- gone.
4 : Mm
2 : They go fast
3 : And that's it
4 : They do
3 : ok.
2 : Yeah
4 : That's it
4 : Alright
2 : So
4 : Well for one of my move, my first move
2 : let's see here.
4 : is going to be to give you
3 : Smart
2 : Thank you
4 : that card.
2 : So I have three now
4 : Well
2 : and I only need one more
4 : And now there's nothing to be shored up.
4 : Oh, wait, did I
4 : oh on the same- Oh.
2 : Oh
4 : Crap
4 : sorry.
2 : Darn it
3 : There's only one person who can do that right? You can do that to anyone
4 : Yeah, and that's you that can give-
2 : I can give it to anybody, yeah.
4 : Yes
3 : Ok
4 : Sorry
4 : Ok, wait
2 : Hm, ok so where are you?
4 : Wait
4 : yeah that's why I was trying to figure out where you are.
2 : Here
4 : No I'm here.
2 : Ok, you're green.
2 : I'm right here.
4 : So I can make two moves to get to you
4 : and then do that legally.
2 : Oh yeah because
3 : You can move diagonally
4 : Yes cause I can get one, two
3 : One, two
2 : Ok
4 : and then my third move can be
3 : There we go
2 : Sweet
4 : cause we're on the same tile.
3 : and I can get your two cards
4 : Thank you
4 : I have
2 : Cause she can move
4 : Two of these
2 : diagonally so that's why that worked
4 : Yes, I need two flood cards please.
2 : Ok
4 : Thank you
4 : Alright, I have Whispering Gardens and Iron Gates.
2 : Alright
4 : There you go
4 : now we're back,
4 : to your turn
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Engineer.
4 : Mm
1 : Hmm
1 : I can just move
2 : Yup
2 : So
1 : Mm
2 : Let's see, does anybody- You have this
3 : Yes
2 : And you do too
4 : Right, but we can't give em to him till we're
2 : Ok
2 : Right, yeah, no I know, I just
4 : So, yeah
2 : thinking
2 : Um
4 : Really it doesn't
2 : So I mean
4 : at this point, it doesn't matter where you wanna move, or you could just not move at all
4 : because
3 : He could do
2 : he could try to get close to that.
4 : actually if he
4 : doesn't move
4 : at all on this turn
4 : you're first thing on your first turn
3 : Could be to give him card
4 : to give him a card.
4 : My first turn is to give him a card then his next turn then he can move
3 : That's a good idea
4 : one, two, and three.
2 : But what if he-
2 : Would it help if he got close to that now?
4 : Then we'd have to move where ever he moves.
2 : Oh wait, oh is it give him a card? Yup, never mind, never mind. Ok, smart
3 : To give him a
4 : Yeah then to (--) a card
4 : So I mean, that's
2 : uh ok
4 : Yeah
3 : So
4 : So I think that would be best, is to actually not move at all
1 : Huh
4 : for you.
1 : I'll go along with the consensus, I won't move.
4 : Ok.
3 : Ok
2 : Cool
3 : and so then you'd still need to draw. Here's the two
3 : treasure cards.
3 : He might even get
3 : (--)
1 : Water Rise ca- card.
3 : (Flood)
1 : Is that
1 : That's a bad thing?
4 : Yup
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : Uh yeah, so move that up one more.
1 : Oh
2 : So
2 : yup, that needs to go up here.
1 : Oh wow
4 : Then we needa
4 : shuffle those cards too and put em up top.
4 : So
4 : And then the
4 : Water Rises card
4 : you'll discard
2 : So that goes back over here
4 : Right back over there.
1 : Thank you
2 : Mmhmm
4 : And then that one just goes into your hand.
2 : Yup, so that's yours, and you can just stick it right here.
4 : Now we need three flood cards
2 : Yeah
2 : so
4 : I'm sorry I feel like I'm being bossy.
2 : No you're- It's
2 : It's good, you're keeping it rolling.
1 : You're the only one who has the knowledge
4 : Sorry
1 : so I gotta rely on uh
4 : mhmm
2 : So these you just need to flood whatever
2 : location is like
1 : Temple Moon
2 : Temple Moon,
4 : No that's where we all are.
2 : oh no!
1 : That was a bad thing?
4 : Hmm
2 : Not really, we can just
3 : I can probably save it on my turn. Someone
2 : shore it up.
4 : Yes.
1 : So what
1 : I get this card?
2 : Uh
3 : Um
4 : Goes
4 : to discard over there.
2 : this goes back over here, yup.
1 : Ok
2 : discard pile.
1 : Breaker Bridge,
2 : Mmhmm, so that gets flooded too.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Also right here
2 : Alright
2 : so that goes over here.
2 : Alright
2 : so
3 : Do we need to shuffle those
3 : and put them on top or that's only when you get a flood card, ok
4 : No
2 : Nope
2 : we already did that, yeah
2 : Alright so I should
2 : probably try to move towards Whispering-
2 : No, because
2 : I need to be- Never mind
2 : nobody has this card.
2 : Um
2 : what should I do?
2 : I'm just gonna- Yeah, shore up
3 : You could try to shore up some, yeah
2 : So, I'm gonna shore up this
2 : and this
2 : and this
3 : Perfect.
4 : There you go.
2 : Alright
3 : Ok
2 : and
2 : Yes!
2 : Check it out!
3 : Awesome
2 : Ok
3 : So hopefully you can get to that
2 : And then
4 : And you can only have
4 : five
2 : huh, oh
4 : cards in your hand.
4 : I saw her move and I realized that's what our problem was.
2 : Ok
2 : one, two, three.
2 : So I should get rid of-
2 : I can get rid of two, right?
3 : Yeah
2 : And they just go here?
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : Three of these
2 : Alright, Temple of the Sun,
2 : Whispering Gardens, oh no!
4 : Is gone.
3 : Ugh
3 : No
2 : And Iron-
4 : Oh I need that
2 : Oh
4 : the Whispering Gardens
2 : Yeah
2 : Iron Gate,
2 : also gone.
2 : That's not cool
2 : Yeah
4 : Oh and
2 : Sorry
4 : also
4 : It's ok
3 : Ok, and that's it?
2 : Yup
4 : Yup
3 : Ok
3 : so I am-
3 : Where am I? I'm blue.
4 : You should give him, wait
4 : oh yeah, you are
3 : We're not on the same card, so I'll move to him
4 : That's right, ok, sorry
3 : Um, that's one action.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : I could do that cause I have the Helicopter.
4 : Right
3 : And then
3 : here's the one of those
4 : Well I have one, two
3 : and
4 : three, four, that's a fifth card, so, ok, we're good on that.
3 : Ok
3 : So that was two actions and I can do one more
4 : Mmhmm
3 : There's really nothing I can do right now, right?
2 : Um
3 : Cause I can't shore up
3 : All I can do is move.
3 : Is there somewhere that you guys think I should move?
2 : You
2 : what if you move-
2 : Can you move
3 : I could move to here
2 : somebody else?
3 : Um
2 : Wait,
3 : no.
2 : I mean just with these, but we might wanna save this.
2 : I'm just thinking about how can I get to here
3 : I could, I could probably just move you, I have two cards.
3 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile, and you are on the same tile
3 : so
3 : I think we could do that.
2 : Should we do that?
3 : Yeah
4 : Yes
3 : So you're
2 : Yup
3 : gray
2 : And that's just, and then that needs to go here.
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok, and then I get two of these.
2 : So I'm all set to
2 : grab that then.
3 : And can you grab me three?
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Those
3 : Tidal Palace,
3 : Copper Gate,
4 : It feels like the holding of the breath to see which one's going.
3 : and the Crimson
3 : Forest. Where's the Crimson- Oh, I got it.
4 : Oh
4 : here.
3 : And that's good.
4 : Ok
2 : So we should definitely unshore those because
2 : that's, yeah
3 : Like we need to get like those two
2 : This is our last one of the,
2 : the-
2 : Oh, never mind.
2 : What am I thinking?
3 : And we need these, for sure.
2 : Yeah, yeah
4 : Yeah
4 : So alright, my first move is to give you
4 : this
3 : Yay
4 : and you'll need to discard either this one or the
4 : rock formation
4 : one.
4 : Either one
3 : Probably the fire
4 : Act-
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah the fire one would probably be the best one to
3 : Cause you do have two of those
3 : if we wanted to do that.
4 : Yeah
4 : Ok
4 : so that's done for that.
4 : Um
4 : Let me see. So that's one action.
2 : Mmhmm.
2 : Wait he has these but he needs to get
2 : here
2 : or here.
4 : Right
2 : Um
3 : I think your best bet might be to move
4 : This is what I was thinking
4 : and then
4 : was to move
4 : diagonal here, cause I did one, that's two
4 : and then
4 : um
4 : I can shore up
2 : Yeah
4 : this card.
3 : Ok
1 : That's you?
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
4 : I mean other than that, that's about all I can really do
2 : I think that's good, that's- this is very important.
4 : at this point,
4 : so.
4 : That's my second move, this is my third
4 : Move, so
3 : Ok
4 : Alright
4 : may I have two cards please?
3 : And
2 : Oh sorry
2 : Uh oh
4 : Oh, the water rises again,
2 : I can do that for you
4 : which means we get to shuffle all this again too.
4 : And that goes
4 : discarded.
1 : So
1 : if we get up here and the water rises then that,
1 : that means we lose?
4 : Yes
3 : Yeah, if it gets to the skull and crossbones.
2 : Mmhmm
2 : the death,
2 : yeah
1 : Oh
2 : So
4 : I need three
2 : Yeah
4 : flooded.
2 : So it
3 : Uh oh
2 : it's
2 : also, we can note that like, these are gonna be ones that have recently flooded.
3 : Yeah
4 : Right
4 : When I
1 : Can the water level ever go down?
3 : No
1 : No?
2 : Nnhmm
4 : It won't go down, no. It'll only go up.
4 : Ok
3 : At least we didn't lose any.
4 : No
4 : that's the- Yeah, that's the best part.
4 : We lost nothing, at least.
4 : That's the end of my turn.
2 : Yeah
1 : Now I gotta move.
2 : Cool
2 : Mmhmm
3 : You could shore up- Or wait no, he needs to get to
2 : Oh yeah
4 : He needs to get to a cup
3 : One, two, three
2 : Yeah
2 : but then, that's an action
2 : taking it.
3 : Oh
4 : Oh
3 : I mean he could at least just get there
3 : and then on his next turn
2 : Yeah
2 : that's fine.
4 : Yeah
2 : I can't think of any alternate
3 : Yeah, so
2 : cause you should probably save that. Yeah
3 : Just go to this one, and then on your next turn you can turn em in to get the,
3 : that thing.
2 : Sound good?
2 : Does that make sense?
1 : It's alright with me.
2 : Cool
3 : Ok
3 : and then
3 : here's the two treasure cards
1 : Wow, look at all the cards
3 : We have to
1 : Helicopter Lift
3 : Uh oh
4 : One, two, three, four, five, yeah
2 : Oh
3 : Uh oh
4 : Oh
2 : Oh no
4 : Well no you can always discard what you just got
4 : it just says you have to discard
3 : I think you can do that, it doesn't say you can't.
4 : Nnhmm
1 : Didn't it say I shouldn't have no more than five cards?
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : So that's what we're saying, you should probably discard the ones that you just got, cause these are important.
2 : What's this?
3 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : The only thing is like are we ever gonna be able to get this like
2 : Yeah, ok and there's more than one of these. Ok
4 : Well, yeah
3 : We're good
4 : Yeah so we're still good on that.
2 : There's more than four in the whole deck, ok
3 : Um
3 : is it all- Oh, flood cards.
2 : And then
2 : flood cards, so three of these.
2 : There you go
1 : Breaker's Bridge
3 : That's that one
1 : Tidal
1 : Tidal Palace
3 : Oh
4 : Nope, that's out.
2 : Oh no
3 : Then can we have that card (--) this card
4 : Good
1 : Tidal Palace, Breaker's Bridge
3 : Um, we don't need to do- Wait, yeah
2 : Breaker's Bridge is ok so that can go in here.
4 : Good thing you moved in the direction you moved
3 : Yeah
4 : because that would've been a waste of moves,
2 : Yeah
4 : if we would've gone the other direction
4 : though.
1 : God made me do that.
4 : Yes
1 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Oo
4 : Yup
3 : Ok
2 : Ok, so this we definitely need to
2 : shore up.
4 : Ok
3 : Yeah, I can shore that up
3 : on my turn.
3 : Cause I'm on it
2 : Alright, so I'm gonna take this treasure
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Do I need to like put these somewhere?
3 : Uh
4 : I believe you discard them.
4 : Um
2 : Capture treasure, if you discard four matching treasure cards to the treasure discard pile.
3 : Mm
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
3 : So that was one action, right?
2 : Yeah
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Um
2 : And
2 : what else can I do?
3 : Probably just move
3 : towards the center more in case, so you can get to
2 : Yeah
3 : more places but you can't really do anything else.
2 : Ok so
3 : You can move to there and then shore up
2 : Yeah, one of em
3 : Something
3 : Yep
2 : (--) that's two
2 : and then I wanna shore up- What do you think would be better?
4 : Oh that's right, cause you can move two
2 : No, I can't but I just counted that as two, so one, two
3 : Oh wait, that would be all of your
2 : Oh, never mind, yeah
4 : Yeah that's her third move, that's- Yeah
2 : Shoot, ok
3 : Oh ok, so you're done.
3 : And then
2 : Was that smart though?
2 : I guess, can I go back?
3 : I don't think there's anything you could've done better.
2 : Yeah
4 : There's nothing, yeah
4 : Either way, there's- Oh wait!
3 : Sorry, I just like, took those away
3 : Oh
2 : Oh, yeah, thank you
4 : We
4 : screwed something up.
3 : We
3 : did that?
2 : Wait
2 : Yup
2 : I did that
4 : Did you miss
4 : a card, that- There's a card still sitting there.
2 : Oh, yeah I did. Oops, sorry
2 : Ok, sorry.
2 : Um
4 : K
2 : alright, so I got those
2 : and now, three of these.
2 : So
2 : Dunes of Deception,
2 : Silver Gate,
2 : Eeh
2 : and Crimson Forest, where's that?
4 : That's this one.
2 : Oh no, that's ok
4 : Ah I mean
2 : Oh yeah, thanks, sorry
4 : That one.
3 : Ok
3 : so it's my turn?
2 : Yeah, mmhmm
4 : Yes
3 : Alright, I was thinking
3 : I could move here, so that I can give you
2 : Oh yeah
3 : a card, so that's two, and then I could shore something up.
2 : Yeah
3 : Actually, I should shore this up first.
4 : (--) yeah
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok, so I'm gonna do that
4 : Yes, that's
2 : Awesome
3 : So one move
2 : Yup
4 : Mmhmm
3 : and then I'll use my Helicopter thing as another move to move here
2 : Uh huh
3 : and then I will give you this card.
2 : Sweet
3 : One, two, three, four, five, ok
2 : Three
2 : So nervous
3 : Ok, I think we're good
3 : Bronze Gate
2 : Bronze Gate, where you at?
3 : Cave of Shadows,
4 : It's over here.
2 : That's Cave of Embers
3 : Oh there's Cave of Embers and then Cave of Shadows is
4 : right
4 : no
2 : Cave of Shadows is this one.
4 : Oh yeah, that's- Ok, sorry
3 : Yeah, that's ok I needed that one too.
2 : (--)
3 : We definitely need to shore up one of those because
4 : Yeah
2 : Yup
3 : You need this
3 : Ok.
4 : Alright
2 : Alright
4 : My turn
2 : so
2 : yeah, I don't know.
4 : I go
3 : Definitely shore this up.
2 : Yeah
4 : That's what I was thinking, cause I can move here
4 : and I can shore these
4 : two as my second and third turn.
3 : Yeah
3 : that sounds good.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
3 : Then make sure you only have
4 : Right
3 : five- Oh you do, yeah you're good.
4 : Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : I only have five and then I need
3 : So, Engineer
4 : three
3 : Oh
4 : flood cards, unfortunately, we still have to, we still have to do that part.
2 : Yeah
3 : Oh no, there's so many sunken things.
4 : Watchtower,
4 : is down there.
4 : Misty Marsh
4 : and the Howling Gardens.
4 : The bottom
4 : Which is fine because we've already gotten that treasure anyway.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : So, we're still good.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
2 : Alrighty so
4 : And now you get to come save the day
1 : I can move
1 : over here.
4 : Well
3 : No, uh
4 : first thing you need to do is turn in your four
2 : Mmhmm
4 : cards so you can get
4 : one of the treasures.
1 : Oh
4 : The four matching
3 : We're so close
2 : Cause you're on it, so you're good.
2 : Thank you
4 : And then
4 : You get that treasure
3 : So that was one action
4 : Ok
4 : now
2 : Ok
4 : Wherever you would like to move.
2 : Maybe we should
3 : This should be shored- Wait, no that's not
2 : That's already shored it up
4 : Yeah that's not
2 : He could shore up-
4 : really
2 : These are like kinda not a big deal, right now
3 : Might as well
2 : Yeah
1 : Maybe if I don't do just-
1 : Don't do nothing again
3 : It wouldn't be a bad thing to shore them though.
2 : What if
2 : what if he moved here, shored this one and that one up?
4 : I-
4 : Mm
4 : I was thinking actually, better would be to move here.
2 : Uh huh
4 : Eh since we're getting close, we're only one treasure away
2 : Oh yeah, get close to Fool's Landing
3 : If he moved to this one he could shore it up too
4 : We need to stay as-
4 : You know, yeah that would
2 : Yeah
2 : He could shore this up and then he'd be close to Fool's Landing to-
4 : Mmhmm
3 : Ok
4 : Yeah, cause you'd only be one move away from
1 : Go for it.
4 : joining when we need to get in there.
2 : So we'll shore that up
4 : Mmhmm
2 : and
2 : move you here.
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : My cards
3 : Two treasure
3 : Oh no
1 : It's like the same cards
1 : How come it always rises when I get the cards?
2 : So, here we have to shuffle these again
2 : Eeh
4 : We're good
3 : We're close
4 : Yeah
4 : we're actually only
3 : We're actually all around it too, which is really nice.
4 : Yeah
2 : K, so
2 : what else do we have to do?
2 : Discard
4 : We discard the
2 : Yeah
4 : the Water Rises
2 : That, um, Water's Rise card needs to just go
2 : here.
4 : You get to keep the Helicopter one
2 : Mmhmm
4 : and then we need three flood cards.
2 : Yeah
2 : So we wanna flood these.
2 : Not that we want to
1 : K, Cliffs of the Canyon
2 : Cliffs
3 : Cliffs
4 : Where is that?
2 : of Abandon, right there, yeah.
4 : Oh
3 : Oh, there we go
1 : Oh, oh
4 : Yeah
1 : Abandon
4 : It's alright
1 : K
2 : That goes here.
1 : Caves of Shadow
1 : oh, right here.
2 : Also here, yup
1 : Copper Gate
3 : Oh
4 : That's gone.
3 : I'll take it
3 : Can I have the Copper Gate?
4 : Oh no
1 : Oh
2 : Just the card
3 : Yeah, that one, good
4 : Yeah
4 : And that's it
4 : we've survived the turn.
2 : Nice
3 : One more
4 : Yes
3 : Wait
3 : what's that?
4 : Oh that's the Helicopter, yeah
1 : Helicopter Lift
3 : Oh, ok we're good
2 : Yup
2 : Ok
4 : You get to keep all that
2 : so
2 : I should grab this treasure
2 : Eh
2 : Ok, wait
2 : should I unflood?
3 : Yeah
2 : I mean
3 : You can do that too
4 : Mm
2 : Yeah
2 : I'll just- It doesn't matter
4 : I don't think it would
4 : really matter at this point
2 : Yeah, that's true
3 : You might as well
3 : So get the
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
3 : thing and then, so that's one action.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Oh yeah, because if it doesn't and we have a fl- Ah
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : The yeah- You could be the one swimming, so
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : That's another action
2 : And then I'm also going to, so that's two actions
4 : I would just move to Fool's
4 : Landing at this point
3 : Oh yeah that's true
4 : We have three treasures.
2 : Sweet
2 : Ok
4 : We just needa make it back,
3 : Ok
4 : all of us make it back at this point.
2 : Let me pick these
2 : We have three already?
4 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh my god, heck yeah!
2 : Ok
2 : um
2 : and these
2 : Breaker's Bridge, bye
2 : Temple of the Moon,
2 : Cave of the Embers
4 : Wha-
2 : K
2 : Oh yeah
4 : We need the Ember one (--)
3 : Ok
4 : (--)
2 : Alright
3 : So I am here
2 : That's it, yeah
3 : I don't need to do anything except
3 : get here,
3 : right?
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Should you-
3 : Do I need to
2 : What is your power?
3 : I could lift people
3 : Uh well you don' t even, we don't even need the lift.
4 : No because he has a lift
4 : to- for
4 : for
4 : Engineer's turn.
2 : We're good, we can all just move there.
4 : Yeah
2 : Let's just do it.
3 : Ok
4 : So, that's your one turn, now we need to
3 : One, two, three, four, five
3 : I don't need them so I'm just gonna- It's a sandbag
4 : Yeah we don't
3 : and we, we're good. Ok
2 : Ok, three of these
2 : Misty Marsh,
2 : Yeah
2 : Dunes of Deception,
2 : where's that? Oh
4 : Oh there it is
3 : There
4 : That one's gone too
2 : Oh yeah, I'm so sorry, I'm awful with that
3 : Wait
2 : Watchtower.
4 : Alright
2 : Ok
4 : And here's gonna be my one
4 : big move
2 : And then
4 : (that'll) take my cards.
3 : Oh wait, you should probably shore up Watchtower, just so that he doesn't disappear.
4 : Good point
2 : Yeah
4 : Oh
4 : glad you thought of that.
2 : That's it right?
1 : Thank you.
2 : He would, he would be able to just swim over there, right?
4 : Yes, I'm sorry, I wasn't even th-
3 : Life saver
3 : Oh that's true.
4 : Well yeah, actually, he would be able to swim, that's fine.
2 : But whatever, yeah.
3 : Eh
2 : Ok
4 : Let's just- Better be safe than sorry, on that.
2 : Yeah
3 : You wanna give em back?
4 : And I'll just give em back, it doesn't matter.
4 : And then three flood cards
2 : Alright
2 : Bronze Gate,
2 : Silver Gate,
4 : This is actually our last
4 : flood cards.
2 : Yeah
2 : Howling Garden.
2 : Yeah
4 : Adn that's gone.
2 : Ok
2 : and now
2 : you just need to move here.
1 : (--)
1 : Right, that's exactly where I was going.
2 : Yeah
4 : Yup
4 : and then
1 : We're now a happy family.
4 : And use your Helicopter Lift card
2 : Ba bam!
3 : Yeah!
4 : And that lifts us out and then we're out of the game.
3 : And now we won
3 : Yay!
2 : Wow!
4 : With seven minutes and fifty eight seconds left, we did it!
2 : Woo!

2 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
3 : That's the Messenger
1 : That's the Messenger
2 : Yes
3 : and this is the Explorer.
3 : Right
1 : Ok, so starts with my turn
1 : um
4 : We just start where we're placed there?
1 : Yup
1 : looks like it.
4 : Just randomly? Ok
1 : I'm not sure it's random, but yeah we just start there. There's little icons on the tiles
4 : Oh yeah
4 : Oh
1 : that show you where they start.
4 : oh
1 : Ah so I think
2 : You might as well start shoring up the ones that are next to you
1 : Yeah
1 : that's what I was thinking. Actually I can just shore up these two
1 : move here, and shore up these two, just to get us out of
1 : trouble
1 : when we need.
2 : (--)
2 : Don't you have one more action?
1 : Nope, that was three actions.
2 : Oh, cause you moved one. Got it.
1 : I moved
1 : so then I need
1 : two,
1 : two of those.
3 : Is that your ability, as an Engineer, to be able to shore up two?
1 : Yeah
1 : I can shore up two- Uh and we got a Water's Rise.
4 : Wh- What was your third action then?
1 : Um
1 : So my first action was to shore up these two,
4 : Yeah
1 : my second action was to move, my third action was to shore up these two.
4 : Oh, ok, got it.
1 : Um, alright, so this goes
4 : Good engineering
1 : up,
1 : this gets shuffled,
1 : and then two.
1 : Alright, well looks like it was these two.
1 : So that was this one
2 : I'll take your treasure card
1 : Hmm
1 : Yup, thank you.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Think that's everything, so that's my turn.
1 : Yeah
1 : You're up
2 : Ok, um
2 : so I guess I will
2 : shore up Whispering Garden first.
1 : Yeah
1 : um what do we have for
1 : treasure cards out on the table, um
3 : I have one
1 : Yeah
3 : Lion with wings
1 : I got two fires and a cup and you've got a cup so
1 : looks like we've got about two of each out.
4 : Yup
1 : So I guess we have to wait and see what we get next.
2 : Ok
2 : um what else should I do?
1 : Um
1 : You could
1 : give one of us a card and then start moving somewhere.
2 : So should I maybe give this to you since you already have one?
1 : Yeah, I've got one of them, if you give me that I'll have the second.
2 : Then
1 : And then
3 : Um
3 : I think since I'm the closest
2 : Mmhmm
3 : to that treasure
3 : um
3 : that maybe I should get those cards,
3 : the card.
1 : Well he can move diagonal so I don't know if we need to worry about that.
3 : Oh yeah
1 : He can't get there in one turn, but there's the other one right here.
3 : Oh, yeah yeah
1 : Um so
1 : you've got
1 : two action- one action left.
2 : One more
1 : Oh if you move
1 : Yeah I was gonna say if you move to the Marsh he can give you
1 : the other stone
1 : and then we can move from there.
2 : Ok
1 : Right, so then draw a treasure first.
2 : So
2 : You (--) another one, right?
1 : Yeah
1 : Ok that
1 : yeah, that makes sense.
1 : And then, two of these guys
2 : It's only if you (see em)
1 : So the Gold Gate's here, that goes away.
1 : That was quick
4 : And then put that guy in here
1 : no this one, Gold Gate
1 : Yup,
4 : Gold Gate
2 : Sorry
1 : And Phantom Rock
1 : is there, that also goes away.
2 : Is also gone.
4 : What
1 : Well nobody was near them, there wasn't anything we could've done about that.
4 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
4 : And they didn't-
4 : Did they even have any treasures?
1 : And then Pilot, I believe
1 : No, they didn't.
4 : They didn't, that's good too.
1 : Yeah
1 : Pilot, you're up.
3 : Oh um, so I cna fly anywhere?
1 : You could, um maybe get the Lost Lagoon flipped back over.
3 : That's what I was thinking.
3 : So
3 : I don't need to necessarily be on it
1 : Nope, you do not.
3 : to,
3 : to shore it up
3 : Just be adjacent to it
3 : So I'm gonna shore it up
1 : And then one more action, where do you wanna go?
3 : I can still move again
1 : You've got- Yeah, you've got one action
3 : Or I can give a treasure card
1 : Yeah, well you're not on a tile with anyone
3 : Oh you have to be on a tile with someone to give a treasure card, ok.
1 : Yeah
1 : unless you're her.
3 : Uh
3 : so I will just move
2 : There a lion by you?
1 : No, uh
3 : No
3 : Uh, yeah there is.
1 : Yeah, the lion, the lion's right where I am, on Whispering Garden.
2 : What if
1 : So you could move up to that
2 : you move on that with him and then give him the fourth one?
1 : Uh that's three actions
2 : Oh wait, you only have two.
2 : Oh, you're right.
3 : Oh alright well I'm just gonna move to Whispering Garden
1 : Yeah, and I also don't have the lion, those two have the lion
2 : Oh, my bad
3 : I draw two treasure cards
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Yup
1 : two of those
3 : Helicopter Lift and fire
1 : Ok
3 : And flood cards right?
1 : Yup
1 : you need two of these.
3 : Thank you
1 : So we got the cl-
3 : Um chiefs of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge
1 : Yeah, the cliffs are right here.
1 : And Breaker's Bridge is here.
3 : Oh (--)
3 : (--)
1 : Nope, that goes here.
1 : Um, Explorer
4 : I'm good
4 : ok
1 : I think you should
4 : Can I, can I shore up a card that's diagonal to me? Ok.
1 : Yes
1 : Yeah
4 : So, what if I did
4 : what if I went
4 : shored that up,
1 : Yup
4 : went here, and then gave her my earth stone?
1 : That makes sense.
4 : Shoring it up,
4 : going there,
1 : And she's got
1 : plenty
2 : (--)
4 : Yeah
4 : She's got only earth stones
1 : You think she's got three of them
4 : Yeah that's a good look.
4 : So then take two treasure cards
1 : Yup
4 : That's some good times there.
4 : and uh
1 : Alright, it looks like we got four fires out also
4 : to my flood thing
1 : Yeah
4 : Still take two
1 : Yup, we're still on two
4 : Moon
4 : and Iron Gate
1 : Iron Gate is
4 : That's probably negligible but that's probably
4 : bad, I don't know.
1 : Well we just, we can't lose both of em.
3 : Does anyone else have a Helicopter Lift card?
2 : Nnhmm
1 : Nope, you've got both of em
3 : Ok so
3 : I'm thinking maybe I can
1 : But we
3 : possibly move uh
3 : somehow get to like the same card that she's on and then lift her
1 : Uh maybe
3 : Or never mind it's right there, Temple of the Moon is right there, actually, yeah.
1 : It's right there and she's just one step away anyway, um we need to
3 : Yeah
1 : get her a fourth one first. Get her a fourth one first
1 : that's the trickier part
1 : um
4 : Is to go to the
4 : to the space that has the thing on there, to get the treasure, right?
1 : Yup
4 : Once you have all four cards.
1 : I think
4 : But we don't want that to sink
1 : Yeah
1 : just,
1 : oh we don't
1 : uh what makes sense?
1 : Well I can, um
1 : go ahead, shore up Breaker's Bridge
1 : move to Misty Marsh and shore up the temple.
4 : There you go
1 : That seems like it'd be useful, so
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Oops, sorry
4 : Wait can you move diagonal?
1 : Uh, no I can't
1 : You're right
1 : Uh I
4 : Maybe you should just move twice and then shore it up.
1 : I can't move twice but- Uh I can move twice but I can't shore it up if I move twice
1 : um
4 : Wait
1 : Yeah I guess I'll go ahead and move.
4 : Wait, wait, wait, why can't you shore it up if you move- if you go like this?
1 : I only have three actions, I already used one.
3 : He shored up Breaker's Bridge.
4 : Oh well I said if you, if you don't shore up Breaker's Bridge
1 : Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can
4 : and then just move twice and then shore that up cause that's
4 : more important to get to, I'm just saying.
2 : The only thing,
1 : Uh, I think it's gonna be ok
4 : Alright, well yeah
1 : it just came out.
2 : yeah
4 : Alright
1 : Um, no I guess- Yeah might as well do that though, just in case
1 : I'll do that
1 : and then um, so that's my three actions.
4 : Uh huh
1 : So we will
1 : we'll, we'll do your idea (--)
1 : And it's a good one too.
1 : I got another Water's Rises
2 : (--)
2 : Good thing you did that then
1 : Yeah
4 : Uh we're at three.
1 : Good idea, good idea.
1 : Iron Gate goes away
4 : Buh bye, Iron Gate
4 : (--)
1 : Alright
4 : Ah man
1 : Um and I've got five and that goes, thank you
2 : Mmhmm
2 : Alright
2 : oh
2 : I might as well just flip these over.
1 : So you, we need another, you know we don't
1 : Yeah
2 : Both of these? K
1 : And then go ahead and move to the Temple
1 : um and we'll try and find a
1 : fourth one for you.
4 : Soon
1 : Hopefully
4 : Or maybe (--) one
2 : I got it!
1 : Got it
4 : Yay
2 : So does that mean I can get the treasure now?
1 : Nope, you have to wait and you have to discard a card so I would toss the sandbags
1 : You're at six right?
2 : One, two, three, four
4 : Yeah
1 : So toss one of the sandbags
4 : In the discard pile.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
1 : or, oh, well I guess we could've used- Oh well
2 : Can't I
2 : was that
1 : Nope, there's nothing- Yeah, I- You could
2 : What if
4 : Would- by wait, what do you mean, like
4 : isn't, isn't grabbing a treasure one of the three actions
4 : one of the four (--)
1 : Ye-
1 : Yeah, it's one of the actions, I mean she has to wait until her next turn.
4 : Oh
4 : Oh
1 : She used three tu- three actions already.
3 : Oh
4 : Oh she did, oh ok
1 : Yeah
4 : Oh, I see
2 : Unless I turn this back over and then I can give this to someone.
1 : No, you'd have to use it
1 : um
1 : that's a
1 : question.
2 : But I drew this after this was already turned back over
1 : Right, right, right
2 : like my turn so
2 : maybe I can't go back.
4 : Yeah I guess you can't
4 : you can't reverse your, your
4 : sure.
1 : I- What I'm wondering is if you could just use it instead of discarding it.
1 : I think it's immediately you have to re- You have to discard a card
3 : Uh yeah I think you have to discard it as well.
1 : when you draw.
4 : Well anyway
2 : Wait, it can played at anytime, does not count as an action.
1 : Yes, but I thi- Mm
4 : Yeah
4 : uh, you can
1 : You must immediately choose and discard extra cards. You may use the power before you discard it, so yeah go ahead and flip Breaker's Bridge.
2 : Awesome.
1 : Ok, um and draw three.
2 : Ok, now
4 : Flood
4 : Yeah
2 : Good thing we did that.
1 : Alright
1 : Breaker's Bridge, Whispering Garden, and the Lost Lagoon, it's right here.
2 : Where's Whispering Garden?
1 : Right here, I'm on it.
2 : I think yeah
1 : You're not on
1 : I'm sorry, he's on it
1 : Pilot
1 : Um I was going to suggest
1 : um, I've got two of the fires.
1 : You've got one and you've got one.
1 : And you're on the tile with me right now, if you can get to the tile
3 : Yeah
3 : mmhmm
3 : Misty Marsh
1 : Yeah, um, but maybe just go ahead and
1 : shroe up the Whispering Gardens first.
3 : Ok
3 : I'll shore it up.
1 : And then you can
1 : fly over
3 : To Misty Marsh
1 : Yup
3 : Cause I'm the Pilot.
3 : And then
3 : I have one more action.
1 : And then give me the fire.
4 : Give him the fire.
3 : Oh
1 : Oh wait, that means I have to get rid of something.
4 : That's ok
1 : Yeah, it's just
2 : Wait, why doesn't he like shore up this too, while he was over here?
1 : Um, ac- He has only three actions.
3 : Yeah
1 : Actually yeah, don't give that to me yet.
2 : Instead of the fire.
1 : Um
1 : I think
3 : I- You know I think you're
3 : (--)
1 : I think, I mean I'd have to get rid of a card and we might as well get it traded
3 : Yeah
3 : And give it (--) to him.
1 : or something first.
3 : Yeah, ok
1 : Um
4 : Yeah, I could use a, a lion
3 : So I still have one more action
1 : Right
1 : cause I've got a lion and he's got a lion.
1 : Actually, why don't you, you, you- we can- so we've got two options here.
1 : Um, either you could've moved here and shored up these two tiles
3 : I don't think
3 : I can move back
1 : No I mean, we can- Your turn's not over.
1 : We can
3 : I have one turn and I can't fly again.
3 : I can only use this
1 : No I'm saying that we-
1 : Your turn's not over
1 : we can do different actions, it's just
2 : I think it'd make the most sense if you gave him the lion because
1 : Yeah
1 : Or you can give him the lion, that's easier
2 : the chance of getting another Water's Rise card right away is probably not
3 : Uh huh
1 : Hopefully
2 : likely, yes.
3 : So I will give you the lion (--)
4 : Oh
4 : Nice
1 : thanks.
3 : End my turn has ended.
1 : Yeah, so draw your two treasure
3 : I have a cup
3 : or the chalice and
3 : the purple rock thingy.
1 : Well we're good on the rocks so
3 : (I can)
3 : I don't have five yet, I mean I don't
1 : Mm no, she's got four.
3 : don't have six.
2 : Like
2 : that one's
2 : useless at this point.
3 : If you have- You can have five cards, right?
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah, you-
2 : Yeah
4 : You can't have more than five, yeah.
3 : Can't have more than five?
3 : Alright
3 : I need
3 : two of those
2 : Three of em
1 : Three
4 : Three now, yeah.
3 : Three
3 : Thank you
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Um Copper Gate,
3 : Crimson Forest,
3 : and the Howling Garden.
1 : That's the one over there.
4 : Oo
1 : It's ok
4 : But we get back to that lion.
1 : You're- We're closer to this one.
4 : Wait
1 : Nope, those go over here.
3 : Oh
3 : Those are for sunken
1 : Yeah
3 : Right, ok
1 : These can come up again
2 : Alright
3 : How would they come up again?
2 : next
1 : Uh if we had a Water Rises card
3 : Ok
1 : they get shuffled and put on top.
1 : Um, I think that's a- You're, so you're up Explorer.
4 : Yeah, ok
1 : So I think
4 : So I can do some shoring
1 : Yeah
4 : um
4 : I think I'm gonna wanna shore
4 : this guy,
4 : yeah?
1 : Yeah
4 : Uh
4 : I think I'm gonna want to
4 : um
4 : let's see.
4 : Do I wanna give you a
1 : No, don't give it to me
4 : No, not yet, cause that'll drop one of your guys off.
1 : Um
1 : Yeah
4 : But wait
4 : you could, you could drop a chalice off no problem, right?
1 : No, we
4 : Because you can give me well a, a lion next turn
4 : I can just move to the lion
1 : Right, but it- So
4 : and secure
1 : I think it's gonne be better if you don't trade me the fire yet
4 : No?
1 : Yeah, um
4 : I don't know it's like a bird in hand next turn man
1 : Right, but I can do it- I'm the next person to go and I can just give it to you.
4 : Right
1 : Um, if you
2 : But you have to be on the same card
4 : No, no, no, what I meant is
1 : Yeah, I know
2 : Like he's thinking ahead
4 : What I meant is
4 : uh, I'm thinking ahead that you give me the lion next turn
4 : and I give you the fire now, you drop a cup
1 : Ok, I guess we could do that
4 : No?
4 : Is that cool?
2 : I think
4 : And then
1 : Yeah
2 : that makes sense because
4 : I jus-
4 : Ok
2 : we're gonna- our three treasures, I have this one already, then it makes sense to get the lion and the fire so that
4 : Right
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, ok, that works
4 : Ok, so I shored, that's one
1 : Yup
4 : Two, I'm moving to um Whispering Garden
1 : Nope
4 : No?
4 : (--)
1 : You're gonna give me the fire first
4 : Oh, ok, whatever
4 : Sorry
1 : Uh, cause you can't do (--) before you move.
1 : Or you can't do it after you move. Now you can go to Whispering Garden.
4 : Oh
4 : like oh I can only give you a card as my last action?
1 : No, you can only give me a card while we're on the same tile, then as soon as you lose
3 : Yeah
4 : Ah, oh right, oh God, I totally forgot about that, ok so great, of course, oh right.
1 : And then now you can move to
4 : Technically, right, ok
1 : Whispering Garden
4 : Uh and I'm gonna go there, ok
4 : and uh two treasures please
1 : Uh I guess we
1 : oh well.
4 : What?
4 : Oh
4 : Oh, look at that.
4 : Um
1 : Cause now I'm not on
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah, that's fine.
4 : Um, Water's Rise
1 : Oh again!
4 : T- Tick it up.
1 : Alright
4 : Tick it up, oh boy.
1 : Do you wanna shuffle em, or do you want me to?
4 : Yeah
1 : I mean you draw three, so, it's gonna be three off of that
1 : anyway.
4 : Lagoon,
4 : Howling, and Copper Gate. Well that's good, that didn't-
4 : Ok.
1 : So the Copper Gate, and the Lost Lagoon, and the Howling Gardens are both gone.
4 : Oh boy
4 : well
4 : See, luckily
1 : Yeah
4 : Alright
4 : that was good times.
1 : Going quick
4 : Whoa
4 : (--)
1 : Alright
1 : so I'm pretty sure
1 : that my turn is just gonna be moving to Whispering Garden and giving you the card.
1 : I don't see any
1 : reason not to do that.
2 : Mmhmm
4 : Mm
4 : No, that's yeah- Well I mean
1 : Right
4 : you can do one other thing. You wanna shore something?
1 : Nope
1 : I can't do one other thing, cause I can't move diagonally.
1 : One, two, three. Three actions
4 : Oh, right, ok.
4 : There you go, that makes sense.
4 : There we are
1 : Alright
1 : Um, alright, I got a Pilot and another one of these guys.
1 : Alright, and
4 : You gotta discard something.
1 : No I don't
1 : Oh yes I do,
4 : Yeah
1 : you're right.
1 : Oh, we can get rid of this.
2 : Lion
4 : Yeah, exactly
1 : And then
1 : see Temple of the Moon,
2 : Can I still
1 : Yeah, you're still, you're still good.
2 : trade on it with the- Ok.
2 : Awesome.
1 : The Whispering Gardens
1 : and yes, you can still trade on it.
4 : Right, right, right
1 : And the Cliffs of Abandon, yikes.
4 : Yikes
1 : Um
1 : so I would suggest, I mean you might as well go ahead and shore it up while you're here.
1 : Turn in to get the
2 : Mmhmm
1 : the chalice.
2 : Oh
2 : do I
2 : put them here?
2 : And then just take that?
1 : I think they go there.
2 : Or do I like
4 : Yeah
2 : like this maybe?
1 : See it here
3 : This says you discard
1 : Discard the cards to the treasure discard pile and move the figurine in front of you.
2 : That- Perfect.
4 : Take that.
2 : Thank you.
1 : And then this, or yeah, that one
4 : K that's one action
4 : or
2 : And then
2 : I think
1 : Yeah, and then shore up maybe the Temple and the Crimson Forest, just to give us
2 : Well, both of these are kind of useless and we really wanna
1 : or
2 : have this one because the other lane was already
1 : Yeah, but you can't get there.
2 : Oh, you're right.
4 : (--) not, I ca- I mean
4 : one of us can shore that.
1 : You'll have another turn first
2 : Wait, I have a sandbag.
2 : Can't I use it on that?
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok
3 : Does it need to be flood- Does it need to be um
1 : No
3 : shored before you can claim the treasure?
1 : No it doesn't, but that just means that, just in case
1 : the, if it, we don't want it to sink before we get the turn.
3 : Oh ok
4 : Was that three actions?
1 : Cause then we lose. Ah that was two.
2 : That was two,
4 : Two, ok
2 : so
1 : No, it was- Just one.
4 : No she moved
1 : The sandbag
2 : I traded in my
1 : she didn't move.
4 : Oh, she didn't move.
2 : things
1 : Sand, sandbags doesn't count as an option- as an action.
2 : Oh, ok
4 : Oh, ok, so you still have two actions,
1 : Yes
2 : So
4 : cause all you did was trade so far,
4 : or capture, as it were.
2 : Um
1 : So
2 : which two things
1 : Um, maybe move and shore up the Cliffs to make sure that we've got a path to walk on.
2 : That's a good idea.
4 : Cause we- you're gonna need to get to that chalice.
1 : Well, we'll also need to get to the landing afterwards.
4 : Palace
4 : Of course
2 : Ok
4 : Yeah, chalice
2 : Maybe we can go for this.
4 : Mmhmm
4 : Embers
2 : Crimson's gone.
4 : Crimson
4 : yeah
1 : And so is Breaker's Bridge.
4 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : Well this is going quick.
1 : Um
3 : It's my turn.
1 : Yup
3 : Um
1 : so why don't you give her a
1 : chalice?
1 : Give the Messenger a chalice, um and
1 : what can you do with
3 : I shouldn't give you this fire just yet?
2 : You're not on the same
1 : Well you need to be on the tile.
3 : Yeah, I was thinking of moving, oh so, I only have
1 : Yeah
3 : two moves left.
1 : um
1 : You could give it to me then we'd have
1 : the tokens for fire
4 : You'd just have to get
3 : I would have to fly
4 : to you know to one of the Caves.
1 : Yeah, but we have a couple extra Helicopter Lifts if we need to.
3 : Yeah
1 : So, yeah, I don't see why not.
4 : Move to his, his uh, move to the Whispering Garden, give him a fire
1 : Yeah
3 : Move using my Helicopter- Oh wait, I'm a Pilot, I'm a Pilot, I'm a Pilot
1 : No, move- You're a Pilot.
4 : (--)
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah and if you give me the fire then I'm tossing this.
1 : Um, which is unfortunate but
3 : We'll get it back.
1 : Yeah
3 : And um
1 : So then on my turn I'm gonna end up-
1 : I think that's it for you.
1 : So draw your cards
3 : My uh
3 : Only gave her a card
1 : Yeah then you moved and then you gave me a card.
3 : Ah ok
2 : Well
2 : do you think it would make more sense for him-
2 : Oh never mind.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : I was gonna- Never mind, it doesn't matter.
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah (--)
3 : And then, two, three
1 : Three
4 : Oh my
1 : Alright, we have the Coral Palace,
1 : it's right here.
4 : Definitely gonna shore that back up.
1 : The Dunes of Deception, that's a lovely name.
1 : And
1 : the Silver Gate, here.
4 : K
1 : I think it's you, you're up, so first thing's first
4 : That's it, it's me, ok
4 : So shore Coral Palace
1 : Uh sure
1 : I don't think- Actually
4 : Yeah
4 : Should I just
4 : go ahead and cash this in first?
1 : Cash it in,
1 : but we do not have- Yeah
4 : Cash this
4 : What?
1 : Yeah, go ahead and cash that in
1 : um
1 : Why don't
1 : I go ahead and play the Helicopter Lift
1 : and get the three of us to the Caves of Embers
3 : Yeah
1 : um cause I can do that on your turn.
1 : Then you can shore that up and that way we're set to
1 : get that and move towards the heli-
4 : And
4 : But I
1 : move towards the-
4 : Ok, ok
1 : You wanna shore one thing up before I do that?
4 : Um, I, I would like to make sure that
4 : we could get a,
4 : a-
4 : oh, oh you think that-
4 : What if ah-
4 : Alright
4 : yeah, go ahead, I mean
1 : Do you have another idea?
4 : No, go ahead, go ahead
4 : lift us all.
1 : Alright
2 : But if this thing sinks, then we're all screwed.
4 : Wait, wait, wait, but it's not, it's
1 : No, it's still his turn so he can shore it up.
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh, ok
4 : Why are you playing then?
1 : Uh
1 : because you can play those at any time.
4 : Oh, even if it's not your turn? Oh, crazy, ok
1 : Yeah
4 : Go for it then,
4 : have fun.
1 : Looks like- It says you can play it at any time.
4 : Is that right?
4 : Really?
3 : I've seen that too
4 : I just thought it didn't count as an action
1 : Uh can otherwise played at any- Action cards can otherwise be played or discarded at any time.
4 : Special action cards
1 : Yup
4 : Ok
4 : alright so
4 : these guys are flying to this, is that what you wanted to do?
1 : Yeah
4 : Ok, cool, we're flying.
1 : And then you can finish your turn shoring up the caves.
4 : Ok, I got two other things to do though, right?
1 : Yeah, so
4 : Um
1 : that's why I was gonna ask if you wanted to shore up maybe the Coral Palace before we did that.
1 : but
1 : think it's ok either way.
4 : Well, well, ok, well fine
4 : can, can, can I shore up the coral palace? Ok so that's
1 : Yeah
4 : one thing right?
1 : Yup
1 : and then shore up the Caves when we get there.
4 : Uh
4 : shore up the
4 : Caves.
1 : And your other thing was turning in the thing.
4 : And
1 : The lion.
4 : Right
4 : ok
1 : So that's three.
2 : Perfect
1 : So draw
4 : Alright, lots of cups everywhere
1 : Alright, and three of these, let's see
1 : how badly
4 : Oh wait, wait,
1 : Yeah
4 : oh yeah, yeah. Yeah
1 : Temple of the Sun,
4 : Yeah
4 : That's un,
4 : unneeded.
1 : Tidal Palace,
4 : Uh ok
1 : above us.
4 : (--)
1 : That'll be fine and the Bronze Gate, right here.
4 : (--) shore it
4 : Yeah, that's unneeded.
1 : Ok
1 : so now it's my turn.
4 : Yeah you wanna
4 : grab that fire
1 : So, let's get the fire.
1 : Throw those go over there
1 : So that is three.
1 : Now we just need to make our way to the landing.
1 : So that's my last two turns-
1 : moves are gonna be
1 : moving me there.
4 : Mm
4 : K
3 : Can't,
3 : can I interfere and play the Helicopter Lift and move
1 : Eh
3 : everyone to Fool's Landing?
1 : Uh, sure but the- Yeah
3 : Oh, or these two
4 : But you got two different Helicopter Lifts so you can move
2 : But we need one of them to get off the whole island.
1 : Well
4 : Oh right, oh yeah, yeah, of course, of course
1 : She needs to get to us also. Actually, it'd be better if you use it to get her in
4 : Or yeah, yeah
2 : But my turns next so I might as well just use my
4 : Get
1 : Yeah
3 : Do I have to be, I have to be on the same
2 : three
2 : turns to use it.
1 : No
3 : I don't have to be on the same land as hers to do that.
1 : Nope
3 : So I can just lift her right now?
2 : But my turn's next, what if I just use my three turns to get there, use the Helicopter to move
2 : both of you guys, cause then
3 : Alright
1 : Yeah actually, if you use it now then you can- Then when she comes we can just leave.
1 : That's the end of the game.
4 : That was good
1 : So, go ahead, mo- Um
1 : Go ahead and move everyone in.
1 : Yup
1 : Alright, and then I have to end my turn so
1 : two of those
1 : and a Water's Rising.
4 : Oh no,
4 : still three though.
1 : Yup, it's still three.
1 : And it doesn't matter cause it's not gonna cost us the game so
4 : There's two Helicopter Lifts
1 : Yup
4 : Oh
1 : Alright
1 : Dunes,
1 : Tidal Palace, and the Bronze Gate, all gone.
2 : Perfect
1 : Alright, and your turn, so
2 : One, two, three
1 : Do you wanna do it, or do you want me to?
3 : You,
3 : you do it man, you're the brains.
1 : Alright
1 : and we're done.
4 : We won!
4 : That was cool, we had like six, more than six minutes left.

1 : (--)
1 : So apparently
2 : So
1 : Ok
1 : Can I have two of those
2 : Yup
1 : So I have the Water Rise
1 : and the
1 : the fire
1 : And then I'm gonna shore up
2 : (--)
2 : You gotta draw
1 : Oh yeah
1 : Um
2 : You have to shuffle it and then put it on top.
1 : Right
2 : because you have two of these
2 : Er
3 : Oh yeah
3 : You should shore up the one that you're on
1 : Oh yeah
2 : (--)
1 : do I have to put that back?
1 : Ok
2 : So that's one action right?
1 : That so like from before.
2 : Oh
1 : Ok
1 : So that's
1 : three right?
1 : Ok
3 : Yeah
1 : So
3 : And then did you draw two?
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
3 : No I mean like the
2 : Well you have to put that
2 : in there.
3 : W-
1 : Oh
3 : We have to put this back
1 : Wait
2 : Alright, and you have to draw two
1 : So the phantom Rock and the Lost Lagoon
1 : So then
3 : So they both sink
1 : Yeah
3 : Thanks
2 : Alright
2 : Ah
2 : Um
2 : Go here for the second one and then shore it up for the third action.
3 : I think you can just be like
3 : adjacent to it, I don't think you need to
3 : Yeah you don't need to be on it in order to shore up
2 : Oh
3 : So you can stay on the one with the Engineer
3 : If you want to
2 : What was I before?
1 : here
2 : Oh
2 : I'll take this
2 : Two actions right?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
2 : Alright
2 : Two
2 : And then two of these
2 : (--)
1 : Yeah
2 : This is flooded.
3 : Thanks
2 : And then the Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Shores it
3 : What is it called Cliffs?
2 : Cliffs oh it's right here.
2 : Oh it's
3 : This one sank
1 : That was sunk
2 : Oh yeah
3 : Ok
3 : Mm
3 : I guess I can use my special power to fly over here and like
3 : from that
1 : Yeah
2 : Here?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah
2 : And then shore this up
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Yeah and then shore up
2 : Isn't that four actions?
3 : NnMm
2 : Cause
1 : Mm
2 : You moved once and then you shored it up and then you flew which is a third.
3 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
3 : No I don't think it counts if
1 : No no she-you can do it adjacently I think
3 : This
1 : No
3 : Does one of your action
3 : if
3 : Oh you're right I did
2 : Yeah so you can't. Ok
3 : Ok never mind so I'll stay here.
3 : Um
3 : What else can I do?
3 : And then give the treasure card, ok
2 : But you have to be
3 : That wouldn't be, that wouldn't be helpful.
2 : Yeah
3 : And on the same, ok I'll just draw these
2 : You have to be on the same tile
2 : Ok
3 : And then
2 : Alright
2 : So you should try to
3 : I need two Flood cards
1 : Huh
2 : Get to here?
2 : And then you should also go there and then she'll give you that.
2 : and you'll have three and hopefully we can draw one by that time.
1 : Yeah
3 : And Gold Gate and Temple of the Moon
1 : Ok
2 : Temple of the Moon. Where is it? Oh
1 : So
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : I'm gonna shore this up
1 : and then
2 : Right here so move two over there yeah.
1 : I'm gonna move yeah
1 : Sweet
1 : Ok
1 : And we have the Whisepering Gar, Garden and the Iron Gate
1 : Yeah
2 : Uh oh
2 : Oh
3 : I mean I don't think you need to do that yet
1 : Ah ok
2 : Yeah it's only after the Water's Rise
1 : Oh
2 : Alright so
2 : Alright
2 : I have two of these so
2 : I'll go
2 : One, two
2 : and then
2 : I'll shore this up
2 : for my third.
2 : (--)
1 : Ok
2 : This counts as a card, right?
2 : So this would be four. Ok.
3 : As a move?
3 : Yeah yeah
2 : So draw two
2 : and then I have to use this immediately.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And then (this goes over)
3 : And then you have to discard one
2 : But I have five now cause I have to use that immediately.
3 : Oh yeah that's not a car- oh yeah
3 : Ok cool
2 : So three
1 : And then
2 : Oh there
2 : (--)
2 : So Iron Gate.
2 : The Whispering Garden(--) ok
1 : Two
2 : And that pulls (--)
3 : Thanks
1 : Ok
3 : Ok so
3 : I have two Helicopter Lift things.
3 : So I'm gonna get us all
3 : to here
2 : Or just you two.
3 : I'm gonna
1 : Yeah
3 : get the two of us to here.
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yup
3 : One of my action, my second actions will be to give you this.
2 : That doesn't count as an action
1 : Ok
3 : Are you sure?
2 : Yeah
2 : So that would be one.
3 : Oh ok
1 : Uh
3 : Then
1 : Ok and then I've
3 : Should I also move you here so that we can
2 : Huh?
3 : I'm gonna, I'm going to move, I'm going to use my other Helicopter Lift card to move the Messenger to this island as well so that
3 : When it's the Engineer's turn.
3 : She can get the treasure.
2 : Do all of us have to be on it to get the treasure? Oh ok.
3 : Is that ok?
2 : Yup
3 : Ok
3 : I think we all have to be on it together.
2 : Do we? (--)
3 : I believe so.
1 : Nnmm
3 : Capture treasure.
2 : It only says if your pawn.
2 : So I don't think all three of us should be on it.
3 : I'm pretty sure that we all have to be on it.
3 : To get it
1 : mm
3 : Where does it say if your pawn?
2 : On the side thing.
2 : At the bottom.
3 : Capture a treasure.
3 : Oh if your pawn is on it.
1 : Both of you
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Oh ok alright then. I'll move you back.
2 : Alright so
3 : But I need to move you anyway.
1 : Yeah
1 : So that works
3 : So that we can do
3 : Ok
3 : Um
3 : And then I guess I can use my special power.
3 : To
3 : Fly here and flood this up.
3 : Or shore this up.
1 : Yeah
2 : Yup
3 : Ok
3 : And that's I think all my turns.
2 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : And then I'll draw
2 : yup
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Cliffs of Abandon
1 : Cliffs
1 : Lots
3 : That's for you
1 : Oh wow
2 : Oh
3 : And Crimson Forest
1 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Ok so I have six cards and I have to get rid of one.
2 : Oh you gotta-
2 : Get rid of um
2 : Uh
1 : I'm gonna get rid of that.
3 : Oh
1 : Earth yeah
2 : Yikes yeah
3 : It doesn't matter I mean six one (--)
1 : So
1 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : I'm gonna get the treasure
2 : Yup
1 : Then I'm gonna
1 : Shore up
1 : This guy
2 : You have to be next to it though.
1 : Oh
1 : Or
2 : So
1 : Does the Engineer have to be next to it?
2 : You have to be
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : I think so.
3 : Wait what's your special power.
2 : Wait you were here right?
1 : I shore up two tiles for one action.
3 : She's right here.
3 : think you still have to be next to them.
2 : That's cool.
2 : So you have to move here and then shore it up.
1 : Ok so I'll move yeah.
1 : Oh that's
3 : Be
3 : Yeah he
3 : Yeah you can do it.
2 : You can shore it up. Yeah, that's the third action.
1 : Is that ok?
1 : Alright
2 : Oh yeah you can shore up two right?
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Thanks
1 : Ok
1 : So I lift the Copper Gate
1 : Um
1 : There we go the
1 : Tidal Palace
2 : K
1 : And then the Silver Gate
3 : Oh ok
3 : So I think that our strategy should be
3 : To make sure that
3 : Like the Palaces and the Gardens and like anywhere that we can
2 : Yeah
3 : get things from
3 : We don't let them sink.
1 : Mm
2 : Alright
2 : Um then let's use this right away.
1 : Would it matter? So yeah we don't need that one.
3 : Well we already have that one.
2 : Oh
2 : Oh yeah
3 : So you can use that for a different one. Cause I guess this doesn't- I would use that for that one.
2 : alright
2 : Yeah that one.
1 : Yeah
2 : So I have two.
2 : alright
2 : Ok
2 : Alright, I'll just shore this one up.
2 : Well no wait, I'm the gray one, so I'll go here
1 : Mmhmm
2 : And then I'll shore this up.
3 : Ok
2 : And then you can give me this one next turn and then that one. Alright.
3 : Mmhmm, that's yeah
1 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok
2 : And
2 : These two
2 : It's five
2 : But this thing again
2 : So what was up?
2 : (--)
2 : Do this first
2 : Then draw three
2 : So Cliffs of Abandon this
2 : So Whispersing Garden
2 : And then Temple of the Moon. Where is it? This one
3 : Alright my first action
3 : Shore up
3 : Second action I'll give you
2 : Me, cause I have two
3 : You you yeah sorry
1 : Oh yeah yeah yeah
2 : And then I'll throw away this one.
3 : Cool
1 : yeah
3 : And then
3 : Third action
3 : I'll f- I'll use my special power to fly here and
1 : Oh
2 : That's the third you can't
2 : Shore it up
3 : Oh
1 : Ok
3 : Ok well
2 : (--)
2 : And then these two
3 : Yeah oh wait I have a Sandbag thing, so
2 : Oh yeah
1 : Oh cool
3 : I'll shore this up
3 : But I can stay here
3 : Cause like it's like anything on the table
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : So that would still be three moves
1 : Ok
3 : Helicopter
3 : Another one of what is this? the Stone of
3 : Enlightenment, what is this called? the Earth Stone
1 : Earth
2 : Stone of Enlightenment
3 : Silver Gate, Crimson Forest and the Temple of the Sun
1 : Oh
1 : Ok
1 : So
1 : For my first move
1 : I'm gonna give you this guy
2 : Other way
2 : No this one, wait.
3 : Oh throw that one away, oh
1 : yeah
1 : oh
3 : It's
3 : equal
2 : She has to get here
2 : then you have to get here. I'll just throw this away because she's nearest.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok I mean I also have that power but
3 : It's cool.
2 : Oh sorry, I keep forgetting.
1 : Ok
1 : Um I'm gonna move
1 : One
1 : Two
1 : Can I do that?
2 : Well you should get here. Cause I already have the four, so I can do it myself.
1 : Oh right
2 : You should get there so I'll give you that
1 : Ok
2 : Those too and then shore, not we already had that
1 : Two
1 : One
1 : We have that yet?
3 : Yeah we don't.
1 : So
3 : Does it matter?
2 : So just
2 : Shore this one up
3 : Yeah that's a good idea, just so you have somewhere to go after.
1 : Mmhmm yeah
2 : Yeah
1 : Y- yeah
2 : Mm
1 : Ok
1 : So I have
1 : These guys
1 : Ok we have the Tidal Palace

3 : Oh it's squishy
1 : Oh
2 : That

1 : Yeah
2 : Ah
2 : Uh-Ah
2 : I'll just go here for the second action and then
2 : Shore this one up for the third
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Draw two

2 : Embers
2 : Bronze Gate
2 : Oh
3 : And Cave of Shadows
2 : (--) yeah
1 : Shadows
3 : Ok
1 : Ok

2 : We all got out here though.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : So
1 : So
3 : Two
2 : I don't think you have to shore it up though cause it's gonna fall anyway
1 : Oh really?
1 : Ok
2 : Well I mean, we already have it though, so
3 : Right so you might as well like not use a move then.
1 : Alright
1 : Ok

2 : One
2 : Can I turn these over?
1 : Um you can turn that one over but
2 : What?
1 : Next turn I can
2 : Oh
1 : move both of them if
2 : Not this one
2 : Um
2 : Let's see, can I move again?
3 : You have three actions yeah
2 : Yeah
2 : That's three take two treasure
2 : Uh one
2 : Two
2 : Nice
2 : I shore up again and I have this
2 : So I'll shore up on any one tile
1 : I would wait to use that
2 : Use that yeah
2 : And this one
1 : What's the other treasure card that you have?
2 : These two
2 : They're over there (--)
1 : Ok
1 : So we should start thinking about how to get
3 : Yeah
1 : People with all of the same kind
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah that's all I got
2 : Oh
1 : I guess you have to draw two of these and then
2 : two of these
2 : Ok
2 : Whispering
2 : Garden
2 : and Gold Gate
2 : (--)
3 : Hm
2 : Here it is so I can turn that over
1 : Well no that one was
2 : That
1 : Sunk so
2 : You have to keep it there
3 : Now it's sunk
1 : Well it's
1 : sunk now because it was flooded before
2 : Uh oh (--)
3 : and that's gone
2 : Ok
2 : Alright so now I can get rid of these
1 : I think this one goes in the uh like
1 : discard pile over there though since
2 : Oh ok
3 : Those two don't
2 : Now I have to take these two
1 : Wait you just drew
2 : Oh
3 : Then you just, you just got then
1 : So put them at the top I guess
2 : I
2 : Ok
2 : Alright
2 : Then I'm done there
3 : Yeah good
3 : Three two, um
3 : I can fly anywhere
3 : Uh
3 : I can only draw two Treasure cards at the end
1 : Yeah
3 : I'm thinking I'll fly here, flip this over
1 : Is there any reason that
1 : We need this one though?
1 : I mean if we lose it doesn't mean anything to the game.
2 : Yeah, it doesn't have one of them
3 : Any other ideas?
2 : No
1 : You could
1 : Hmm
3 : Um no
1 : I'll shore these
1 : But
1 : You could just move here and shore both of them since
1 : there's nothing better to do.
3 : That's what I'm saying I might as well get here and shore this up.
1 : Yeah
1 : Or
1 : either way
1 : just go ahead it's
1 : a matter of time I suppose
3 : And another move
3 : um
3 : Yeah just skip it
3 : Um
3 : draw
3 : two
3 : and
3 : two water
3 : phantom Rock Lo
3 : Lost Lagoon
3 : That's funny
3 : phantom Rock
3 : Lost Lag-
2 : We have to think about this thing here, when is that we move that up, is that any one
1 : Um only when we draw the Water's Rise
2 : Ah just the Water ok
1 : I think those go in the discard pile
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh
1 : So my turn
1 : Let's see
1 : Shore these, both of these up
1 : and I'll start moving towards this because I already have two of them.
1 : Unless you guys have any
3 : Yeah I got one to give you
1 : Alright
1 : And then I draw two of the treasures.
1 : So this is already almost done.
3 : Now you have three
1 : And then
1 : Iron Gate and Temple of the Moon
2 : Ok I guess it's my turn if I'm up here
1 : Yeah
2 : (--)
1 : So you could shore this just in case
2 : (--)
3 : Yeah
2 : (--)
2 : Ah and then
2 : This is two, two other actions
2 : Um
2 : Can I mo- hit you here?
1 : Yeah that'd be a good idea because then I can give you this when my turn starts.
2 : Yeah ah
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
2 : That's two and then the third one
1 : You don't have to do a third one, it's probably good to wait there.
2 : It said one, (--) ok then two treasure
2 : Uh oh we finally got this
3 : Oh
1 : So we move this up to three then.
3 : Boomer
2 : (--)
1 : And then
2 : (--)
1 : discard this
2 : down there
1 : And shuffle that
2 : And this one's
2 : One of the kings
3 : This is it
2 : This is it?
3 : Shouldn't this go up here?
3 : Treasure discard
2 : I don't know
3 : Yeah
2 : this one I guess I can hold on to.
2 : then I can get th-
2 : to the water level I get three of these.
1 : Yeah
3 : It's not a three though
1 : No it just moved up to three
2 : No he just moved it
1 : because we did it twice
1 : because I, I drew the card on my first turn
1 : and so it went up from
1 : Novice to normal and then it went up again just now
3 : Oh
2 : Oh
3 : when
3 : you can push it up
1 : Hmm?
3 : You push the notch up physically
1 : Yeah
2 : So this
1 : it is, it's here
3 : Oh I'm
3 : I was thinking this would be three
2 : Oh this one
1 : No this whole, this whole like blue section's three, yeah.
3 : Um yeah ok alright alright yeah you're right, you're right
3 : My bad
2 : Temp- Temple of the Moon
1 : No worries
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : Mm no
1 : That's this one
2 : And then that thing is over
2 : And then Iron Gate
3 : Ah
2 : (--)
1 : So
2 : Yeah stick it over there
1 : Iron Gate had
1 : No it didn't have one
2 : Like it or not
2 : I guess it's your turn
1 : Oh I'm sorry the ah that one got it
2 : Oh
1 : Discard so
1 : This one goes in here
2 : Um
3 : Makes sense
3 : Alright so
3 : What can I do, um
1 : So you could
3 : I'm going to
1 : move over here and give me that card so that it could
1 : Um have another one of these
1 : and then
2 : how did you luck out with all of those
3 : I need three though
1 : luck
2 : just lucky
3 : Yeah he only
3 : You only need three though I think
1 : No you need four for it
2 : We should all move to this and then get out of town
3 : Mm alright what else can I do um
2 : Get out of town
3 : two more moves
3 : I'll
3 : push this thing.
1 : Oh you may only have five so
1 : I have to discard one
1 : Um
1 : that was ah
1 : dumb choice on my
1 : Mm
2 : You wanna give any out?
1 : I can't give them though
3 : Yeah
2 : Ah
3 : Not yet
2 : How about if I give you this
2 : You give me that
3 : What's the red thing, (--).
1 : Um this is my, my card like.
3 : Ah
1 : Can we undo a move that we've
1 : made or is it too late?
1 : Ok
2 : I can give
1 : So
2 : treasure card to a player anywhere for one action.
1 : Wait
1 : in that case
1 : take this one back
1 : so they don't have to discard.
1 : And then I'd recommend moving here to shore that so that we don't lose
1 : the treasure
1 : although the treasure's here
3 : So I did just shore this thing up
1 : Ok
3 : but I can fly
3 : So
3 : fly here
3 : and shore this baby up
3 : that's a problem
1 : well
1 : no it's fine just switch the
1 : Ok
1 : Was that four?
1 : Ok so which one should we undo then?
1 : Sorry
1 : um this was unshore, this was
3 : yeah
1 : sh
2 : Mm
1 : Sorry about that
1 : Um
1 : So then did you draw the ah
1 : Flood cards?
3 : Mm do I draw two of these?
1 : No I don't think so
2 : (--)
2 : Is he still on his turn or did we skip a turn? Oh his turn is still ok
1 : He's on his turn still
3 : Alright so which one to get rid of?
3 : I'll keep this one for you
3 : I think I'll
1 : We should probably
1 : give up on this because
3 : Yeah
2 : I have one of these
3 : this dis
3 : that and
3 : three flood cards
3 : Lost Lagoon, Whispering Garden, Breaker's Bridge
1 : what's the second one?
3 : Mm ah
3 : Break
3 : Whispering Garden
1 : Oh and Breaker's Bridge
3 : Yeah
1 : and then
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : Ok
1 : Ok
3 : Oh these go to flood discard except for
1 : So then
3 : Lost Lagoon
1 : I would start
2 : ok
1 : Going to
1 : give you this one
2 : ok
1 : um
1 : then
2 : I have to get rid of one
1 : move here
1 : and shore both of these
3 : Oh we, we kind of gave up on this (--)
2 : Yeah
1 : Yeah so
2 : What about
2 : if I use this for anything?
1 : Yeah you could use that
3 : On your turn you could but right now he gave it to you
2 : On on my turn. See I have six cards now
3 : So you gotta
3 : give up
1 : Oh wait wait
1 : this one first.
1 : So
1 : Right
1 : Flood cards
1 : phantom Rock
1 : Howling Garden
1 : Crimson Forest
1 : Ok
1 : and then your turn
1 : So
2 : Well I told them yes so
1 : he yeah
3 : Yeah you gotta get rid of that one
1 : I guess you either have to use the Sandbag
1 : Or discard a card
2 : Yeah
1 : Um
2 : I don't know
2 : doesn't count as your-
2 : one tile on the island
2 : shore up
1 : so you get to shore up this since it's
2 : this one?
3 : Yeah why not
2 : then do I just discard this
1 : Yeah
2 : Over here? Ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Now is it my turn now? So I have to
2 : move
2 : Guess I could move here
2 : Um
1 : Well
3 : What
2 : No
2 : what, what
2 : (--)
3 : And that was three turns wasn't it?
2 : (--)
2 : three actions
2 : is that that doesn't count as action.
1 : That didn't count
3 : Oh yeah, yeah
2 : Oh so I can do this
3 : It's
1 : Well you don't want it to be
3 : that's a bet
2 : No, no
3 : this is good right now
1 : flooded
2 : then ok what about if I change this?
1 : You have to be next to it though
3 : Y-
3 : Yeah
2 : Well can I move one more?
1 : That would actually be a good place to move because
3 : You didn't
2 : (--)
2 : Yeah
1 : We can start giving you more of these
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah yeah yeah
2 : Yeah ok
2 : And then one more
3 : (--)
2 : action
1 : Oh give him
1 : Ah this card
2 : Yup
1 : Yeah?
2 : Alright that's a good idea.
2 : And then I get two of these.
2 : Uh oh, I got these.
1 : Oh another one.
2 : (--)
2 : another one
2 : See I don't know if you'd move
2 : in that same thing
2 : for water- one tick mark
3 : Oh
2 : So it's just still on three
3 : Yeah we
3 : We gotta immediately discard it
2 : and this one's what you need.
1 : Yeah I think you do have to
2 : so
3 : Yeah I gotta immediately do
3 : I'm thinking Helicopter Lift card
1 : yeah
2 : Ah
1 : You practically have that ability
1 : Not quite but
2 : I bet I
1 : Wait
1 : You have to wait until it
2 : Are we up to
1 : Now you can draw three
2 : (--) three
2 : because it went up
3 : lucky us
2 : Ok
2 : Crimson Forest, where is that now
3 : Um
2 : There
2 : (--)
2 : Temple of the Moon
2 : and that would be discarded here.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Ok and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Cliffs of Abandon where is that?
2 : Oh
2 : So you stay on there and then discard there
2 : Ok now it's your turn you always take ten minutes so it's long.
3 : I'm gonna flip this boy
2 : Heh
3 : Um
3 : You're trying to get this thing right?
1 : Yeah but
1 : I don't know if I should
1 : give up on
1 : ah one of these cards since
1 : these are the treasure we're closest to
1 : I'd have to discard if you gave it to me
3 : How else are we going to do it though?
1 : Um let's wait
1 : We could wait for that one.
3 : I flipped it I'm going to
3 : Can you
3 : I'll go move here and flip this alright?
1 : Or um
1 : If you move to where I am I can
1 : shore both of these in one move
1 : and give you the card.
1 : So
3 : That's good
3 : And
3 : I'll use
1 : well there's not point if I'm going to
3 : No point
1 : Shore both
1 : Unless we lose one of them
3 : Might as well cause I'm gonna give up one anyway right?
1 : Ok, right, right.
3 : He just picked Cliffs of Abandon right?
1 : Um he picked both of them I think.
3 : Yeah he did
3 : Ok I'll just pick this then.
1 : Ok
1 : So then draw the two and then
1 : or from the
1 : the normal one right?
3 : My bad
3 : I think I'll just
3 : put them right back.
1 : Well you get one extra card.
1 : You're
3 : Oh I have four, my bad.
3 : Yeah this we gave up on so I'll just take this.
1 : Ok
3 : And the
3 : Flood
1 : Yeah three of these
1 : Yeah three of these
3 : Howling Garden, Whispering Garden, Breaker's Bridge
3 : Oh good thing.
1 : Ok um
1 : So I'll start off
1 : giving you this one
3 : Thank you
1 : and then
1 : I'll
1 : shore up both of these
1 : and move one here
1 : So then I draw two of these
1 : Thank you
2 : I have to remember the color.
3 : Oh good
1 : Ok
2 : How come I have five? I always thought it was four, but I have two of these
2 : I know I'll give you one of these
1 : Great
2 : Um
1 : So I'll
1 : get rid of
1 : this one
3 : Yeah, yeah
1 : And then I'll draw these three
1 : Silver Gate
1 : Cave of Embers and Copper Gate
1 : Cave of Embers is here.
1 : Oh that's Cave of Shadows
3 : that's right here, where's Cave of Copper Gate
1 : And that
3 : Right here
1 : Ok
1 : So now it's your turn
2 : Ok
1 : Um
1 : If you
1 : give him this card
1 : We can
1 : get that treasure next turn
3 : He has to be on the same square though right?
1 : No he's the
1 : Messenger so that's his power
3 : I can get anyone, awesome
2 : Ah
3 : Alright
3 : Um
3 : He can give you the red one correct?
2 : (--) kinda give you this one for one action.
1 : But then I lose one of these is the problem.
2 : Hmm
3 : Oh
1 : So we might want to wait until next turn
2 : (--)
2 : Alright
3 : So I'm gonna get rid of
2 : Then um
3 : this
1 : If
2 : If I move here
1 : Well
2 : I could get rid of
1 : If you move here
2 : It'd be there yeah
1 : And shore it just in case
2 : Yeah
1 : Then I can give you
1 : both of these next turn.
2 : Ah
2 : That's the second one
2 : and the third
1 : If you shore it up just in case
2 : Shore here?
1 : No um
2 : Um
1 : flip this one
2 : Alright just flip that one?
2 : Now do I still have one more action?
1 : I don't think so
2 : No then? Alright we turned it over so I get
2 : Two of these
2 : So that leaves me with five and this one
2 : I have to get rid of hm
1 : I think we gave up on this treasure.
2 : This one, yeah
2 : Should I just
2 : get rid of one?
2 : And keep one?
2 : Do it that way?

1 : Yeah you trade them in there and then you just take them.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : I guess (--)
3 : and
2 : (--)
3 : move up figurine in front of you
1 : Oh treasure card pile

1 : Yeah it does
3 : Alright
1 : Alright
1 : so then you draw.
3 : Well I just flew up there and
1 : Oh so that's two but you don't really have anything else to do so

1 : You'll have to discard but
3 : Mine is easy
1 : Well

2 : Oh this would be the only one unless I give you one of those back
2 : cause you need one
3 : the Lion, the Lion we gave up on.
2 : So should I just give it to him like that?

1 : And then I take
2 : Three
4 : Uh it's still on two I think so
1 : T-Two
1 : It's still on two
2 : Oh ok
3 : It's still on two
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok so
1 : Temple of the Moon
4 : which you're on
1 : (so I'm on that) And then Golden Gate
3 : Golden Gate, Golden Gate, ah we lost Golden Gate.
2 : Oh no
1 : Oh that's sad
2 : Ok
2 : So now it's my turn?
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Ok
2 : So I am
4 : Did you
4 : that card also needs to go in here I believe
3 : Oh thank you, thank you, the Golden Gate card
1 : Oh yeah
1 : Good call
2 : Ok
2 : So I am going to
2 : give this to you
2 : just in case and
2 : shore this
2 : That's two, I think I'm, should I do one more or is that
2 : And I think isn't it, is two shore ups count as one I thought
2 : So hers was
3 : For the Engineer. Engineer can do two shores ups as one action, everyone else it's
1 : Yeah for me I can do two (it's like one)
2 : Oh so she could have taken another
4 : can only do
3 : No no she shored up
2 : couldn't ok
1 : Cause I moved yeah
3 : Moved to sh- mmhmm.
2 : Oh ok ok
2 : So should I move or should I just stay?
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Yeah
2 : Do I need to be closer to, ok I'm going to start moving to Fool's Landing.
3 : Good i- good idea get a little-
2 : Just because
4 : Yeah
4 : Um I don't
1 : Oh yeah you can't go diagonal
2 : Ok
4 : You can't move diagonally though
2 : Oh right ok so
4 : So
4 : You could move
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah that's just an L both ways
1 : Ok
2 : Ok so I have a Sandbag and then I'll do this ok I'm good.
3 : And flip
2 : And then
1 : Yeah
2 : Two of these?
4 : So
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Two yeah
2 : So Lost
2 : um Lagoon and phantom Rock
1 : Oh
1 : That's right there.
3 : Oh no Phantom Rock's gone.
1 : Ah man
2 : (--)
2 : Oh man ok
3 : Ok, ok my turn I'm on Fool's Landing
3 : I'm gonna Helicopter over to uh Lost Lagoon as my first action and then shore it up as a second one.
3 : And
3 : As I'm the only one with an Earth card right here, I'm just going to um
3 : I'm gonna stick close to you right here if we need to uh trade off things so I took my two actions, draw two treasure cards please not uh Water Rise cards
1 : Alright
3 : I get a ah
3 : One of the Water Treasures and another
3 : Ah
2 : Oh so you
1 : Oh you can only mo-
2 : You couldn't do the last. You
1 : You can only
2 : couldn't
1 : helicopter over there (--)
2 : but couldn't you move one?
3 : Oh sorry that wa- that was a diagonal move. I am sorry, it was a diagonal move, that's what the error was so
1 : That makes sense
3 : sorry about that. I'm just gonna move horizontally cause we cou- all of u- cause you are the only one who can move diagonally right?
4 : Mmhmm
1 : Yes
3 : Ok, ok we're good.
2 : We, yeah we're getting there don't worry
3 : Ok so it was helicopter
1 : Mmhmm
3 : shore up
3 : now
3 : orthogonal move
3 : two cards
1 : Yeah and then we need
3 : Got a water treasure, I have four, I don't have to discard anything now. Flood, Cities of Abandon and Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ok that's Breaker's Bridge
3 : Oh good and city, Cliffs of Abandon. Yeah thanks, thanks. These go on the discard pile
3 : And I think I am done then
4 : Ok um
1 : Alright
4 : I'm gonna move diagonally
4 : And
4 : Then shore up, so that was two
4 : Um
4 : So before they were both sunk I was thinking about
4 : Using one of my turns to move to you and then give you that but
4 : Discard it um
3 : Ah
3 : You could try to move closer and we could do a handoff on my turn.
4 : Yeah
4 : I'm just gonna move over here that way I'm at least
1 : Yeah that probably works
4 : Well let me see
4 : Because you have
1 : Yeah we don't have
4 : I think it's better that I move closer to you cause I do have one of the same cards as you.
1 : Yeah
3 : Uh I think you moved dia-, did you move diagonally on that one?
4 : Ok
1 : Yeah you can't
4 : Yeah on both of them, I'm, I'm allowed to so yeah
3 : Oh duh, oh sorry, that I just said you were the one
1 : Alright
2 : Can you shore that up on one of your turns?
4 : No I already use
1 : Or I can shore- I mean it's my turn now.
4 : Three turns
2 : Uh ok
2 : Oh
3 : So you got your- your actions and I
4 : So
4 : Yeah so
1 : Oh yeah we still have to do that
3 : get
3 : Two of these cards
4 : Ok
4 : And then two of these, Whispering Garden and Iron Gate
1 : Is that one
3 : I got Iron Gate
1 : Alright
4 : Ok
1 : So should probably shore this up
1 : So that's one
1 : Um
1 : (--)
3 : We better get, if we had a way then, better to get to Whispering Gar-Garden
4 : Yeah everything's far away.
1 : Yeah
3 : actually you're the Ex-
4 : Well
3 : You're the one we're going to be passing off the cards to and
4 : She's closest to Whispering Garden so on her turn I think
1 : Yeah so you could
1 : Should I just move to you guys just
4 : Yeah it's probably not bad to be on the
1 : in case
1 : So we can get these
4 : Yeah I
1 : ones maybe?
1 : (is that what)
4 : Think that would be good?
1 : Alright
2 : So do you need to be near me to get those cards or can I just take them on my turn?
4 : Um you're the Messenger, so I think you can give me a card from wherever.
1 : But then you'll have more cards in your hand you'll have to discard one so we have to wait on that one.
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Ok then
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Actually ah, if you've got five cards
3 : If you've got ah an extra action, do you ha- do you have any actions left? You could hand off one of those cards.
3 : To ah one of two of us
3 : If you want
4 : It's not my turn though so if I can't hand off.
3 : Oh ok ok that's right.
1 : Yeah it was my turn, I still have one more move but
3 : That's right sorry
1 : Nothing really
4 : Uh I would just
2 : Ok
4 : leave that action there.
1 : Yeah
1 : So I guess it's your turn.
2 : Oh
4 : And did you draw your two cards?
1 : Oh no I forgot. Good thing. I always forget to do that.
1 : Oh I got another Water's Rise card.
2 : Oh no
1 : I no
4 : Well this is bad now.
2 : Ok
1 : I know
2 : So you have Copper Gate, Temple of the Sun, Crimson Forest
1 : We (have to) ah put these on top first yeah
3 : why do
2 : oh my God sorry
3 : Yeah we have to shuffle first
2 : That's sucks guys
4 : Yeah we're
3 : And then ah this goes into the
1 : Yeah
3 : Thank you
1 : So (--) we got
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : and Iron Gate, um
4 : Ok
2 : Iron Gate
1 : Yeah oh it's gone.
4 : Oh and we're on Breaker's Bridge
3 : Ok
1 : Oh and
1 : Of course
2 : Ok have we lost any of the ones where we can go to?
3 : I didn't
4 : Ah
3 : Um no
4 : As far as
3 : No I think we've got, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven all the treasure spots are good.
4 : You mean like for the treasures?
2 : Ok this one is like
1 : Mmhmm
2 : In
2 : In like a danger zone so
3 : critical
1 : Yeah
4 : Wait of we have seven that means we did lose one, but
3 : (--) Temp
3 : Alright, I- I count, I count eight, eight on the board.
4 : I think right
4 : Oh eight ok then
1 : Ok
2 : Oh
4 : Um
4 : So it's your turn?
2 : Ok so should I just give this to you or
4 : Um
4 : So I think one of the things you want to do is
2 : I can't
4 : Shore that up
2 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
4 : So that's one turn
1 : You might
4 : I don't know if you should move and then shore that up and wait to give me that card?
1 : Oh
1 : If you wait then you can give me that one which
4 : Yeah
1 : If you guys both gave me the blue one that would get rid of all of them
4 : Yeah I think I would
4 : Move and then
4 : Shore up Temple of the Moon
4 : You can- you can move there and then since you're adjacent to it you can
2 : Oh right cause I can't move diagonally (sorry guys)
4 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok and then
4 : That was your actions
2 : Ok great
4 : So
1 : That's it
2 : Mmhmmhmm
3 : Uh you've got six Treasure cards
2 : No this one doesn't count
3 : Oh
3 : Oh that's right
1 : Oh that's her
3 : That's doh
2 : That's ok
2 : So we have Whispering Garden, Lost Lagoon and Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Mm
2 : Mm
4 : What was that?
1 : Where is it?
3 : This
2 : Cliffs of Abandon. Oh here it is.
1 : Oh
1 : We're on it.
2 : Damn
2 : (--) my turn.
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : Um
3 : So
4 : Your turn?
3 : My turn?
3 : Ok
3 : You've got more of the ah Water cards. I better give you uh the Chalice.
4 : So
1 : Yeah probably.
3 : So you can go four, ah four of a kind there.
1 : Mmhmm. I just have to get rid of one.
3 : And probably um
3 : I don't want Whispering Garden to sink
3 : So um
3 : I'm gonna head over there as my Pilot's uh
3 : once per turn thing and then shore up Whispering Garden.
3 : I've taken three acitons.
3 : Two cards, thank you very much. My two cards are these.
1 : Alright
4 : And when we trade cards it's only one at a time right?
4 : cause
2 : Can the Messenger?
1 : Yeah
3 : One or- one or more actually, the rule card says
4 : W-
4 : Oh really?
1 : Ok
4 : Because
4 : I was gonna say maybe you should wait to move and
4 : because
2 : well you can
4 : my thought was like I would
4 : give these to you because like
4 : I, I have five cards right now and
3 : Ah ok
1 : Yeah
3 : Ah I see
4 : I need to get rid of some so
3 : Darn
3 : (--)
4 : But
1 : Can you discard any card or does that have to be?
3 : Any card I believe the rules ah
3 : say
3 : So
1 : Ok
3 : Now I did the treasure cards next thing three flood cards, three flood cards ah
2 : Ok here's the flood.
3 : Temple of the Sun
3 : Ah Copper Gate and Crimson Forest. I see Crimson Forest.
1 : Ok Copper Gate's right below it.
3 : Copper Gate
3 : Thank you
3 : These three go there and I think that is the end of my turn then.
2 : The other thing is is that he can
2 : also fly one of you guys with the card somewhere.
1 : Oh Ok
3 : You can use this at any time so uh
4 : Ok
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Tell you what
2 : Wait during your turn though or any time? During the game.
3 : Does not count as an action so my understanding is uh
3 : at any time.
1 : Yeah (--)
3 : Not just your turn.
3 : It says ah on the rules.
4 : Ok then that's good
1 : Ok that's good.
3 : So
2 : Mm
3 : So if um one of your actions is going to um
3 : Yeah
4 : Well
4 : just
4 : um draw whatever cards you need and I think I know what I'm going to do so
3 : Ok I, I, I'm done with my turn
1 : Yeah
3 : So if
4 : Um
3 : If you want the Helicopter Lift you're welcome to it.
4 : So do I have to do that now or can I
3 : Any time you want just ask for it and
1 : We could
4 : Oh ok
1 : I'm just thinking
3 : doesn't count as an action.
1 : You give me the chalice and I (just discard)
1 : Probably this one since it's not really in the pile and then we can use the Helicopter Lift to like
4 : Yeah and I
1 : fly to it.
4 : Yeah
4 : Um
4 : Did you
4 : draw your
4 : Water cards and what not yet cause I can't
3 : Yeah we ah we got
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah these are that
4 : Oh ok
4 : Oh duh, yeah we just did that
3 : Those guys so I am done with my stuff
4 : ok um so
4 : Yeah and now that I'm with you I will just
4 : give you that
1 : Alright so then I'll just discard this one
4 : Um
4 : I guess
4 : I want to shore something up
4 : which one do you think?
4 : Is there one that
4 : Seems more important than the other?
4 : At this point?
4 : cause I can do this
4 : that or that
2 : Can't you do all three?
1 : You can do two right?
4 : No I can only
2 : Oh
3 : Mmhmm
4 : Two
1 : Yeah if you did the one you're standing on and then the one
4 : Ok
1 : next to it?
4 : Yeah we'll do that.
1 : Or which ever one, either one.
4 : So that was two turns.
4 : Right?
4 : And
1 : Well you gave me a card so that counts as a turn.
4 : Um
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So that was three.
4 : Oh three.
1 : Yeah
4 : Yup
4 : Ok Water's Rise and move it up a tick mark
2 : Mmhmm that's good.
1 : Sorry, I was trying to move this the other way, but it's taped.
4 : And
3 : Ah um shuffle, shuffle, shuffle don't dra oh ok.
4 : Ok
1 : Oh we have to- forgot to shuffle them.
2 : Oh meow
1 : Um
1 : Try to shuffle them really good.
3 : So we
4 : Three
3 : If we have to discard that then three.
4 : Ok
4 : Lost Lagoon
4 : Oops I don't know what I'm doing
4 : Temple of the Sun
2 : sunk
1 : Goodbye
4 : And Cliffs of Abandon
4 : Also sunk
4 : so you are swimming now
1 : Oh
3 : Uh yeah the other way
2 : Ok I'm gonna
3 : So
2 : just go here guys.
3 : can you
2 : Oh no I can't. I have to go adjacent.
3 : Go d-
1 : I don't think you can go diagnonal.
4 : No
3 : I think ah yeah
2 : Ok so I'm just
2 : here
4 : Yes
1 : Ok
2 : So is it my turn? No. no. sorry
1 : So
1 : It's my turn. So should I just
1 : go one two and then claim it as three?
3 : Sounds, sounds good. I don't see anything that desparately needs ah shoring up. That sounds like a great plan.
1 : Two
2 : Yeah
1 : Alright, wait, wait what do I do with them when I claim it?
2 : Yeah
3 : I guess we just keep it off to the side?
2 : We
4 : I think you need, don't you need all four? Oh you do have four, sorry.
1 : Yeah um
3 : Mmhmm
4 : I thought you had
4 : only had three
4 : Never mind.
1 : Oh discard pile
4 : So
1 : So I'll just stick them
3 : Ok
1 : So I'll just keep that right there. Oh ok
4 : Whoo hoo
3 : Yup
3 : Yup we've
1 : So then I need um
1 : Yeah Treasure card
4 : Treasure cards and
1 : And then
1 : three of these
1 : So I got
1 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Copper Gate
1 : and
1 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Ah Copper Gate is a goner
2 : Copper Gate's down
3 : sunk
4 : Ok we can't let Temple of the Moon sink because
3 : Yeah
4 : Uh
4 : It has one of those
3 : So
4 : The one of the ones we lost already
3 : is ah Copper Gate card ah
1 : Oh yeah
3 : cause this got sunk just now.
1 : There you go
3 : Copper Gate is gone.
1 : Alright so that's your turn.
2 : Ok
2 : So
2 : What did (--) Temple of the Moon you said?
1 : Yeah
2 : Should I shore up ah (--) yeah so I can
2 : Can I do that, cause it's diagonal? I can only do that adjacent right?
1 : Let's See here
4 : For Sandbag
3 : Say what does- what does the card say. Shore up any one tile at the island, does not count as an action.
1 : Oh doesn't count as an action.
2 : So I'm gonna do this
3 : Good idea. Good idea.
2 : That's not an action
2 : And now that I'm gonna do this which actually
2 : counts as an action
1 : Ok that's one
2 : that's two
2 : one
2 : and then
2 : So I can give these
2 : Who's blue?
2 : Oh
3 : I'm Pi Pilot
2 : sh ok should I give
4 : Um I don't know if it might be better
3 : Ah
4 : Like
2 : About to just give it to y-
4 : I have two already but
1 : Yeah
4 : So
2 : But where
1 : If
1 : we'd have to wait one more time around
2 : Yeah so
4 : Yeah we'd have to wait just because
1 : cause you'd to give me both of yours and then on
3 : So I tell you what do you have to actions left?
4 : Yeah
1 : Ah next term?
1 : Yeah maybe we should shore up
3 : If
3 : If you have two actions
3 : Ah
3 : Here's here's what I'd recommend.
4 : You could move and then shore up
3 : I'd recommend you could move
3 : one action
3 : Pass off two of the ah
3 : yellow uh treasure cards
2 : I can only do one then my two actions was gonna give
3 : actually
2 : To to someone
1 : Well
4 : Well the problem is I have too many cards so like
1 : you can't
3 : One or m- one or
3 : Yeah
4 : That's
1 : Yes
2 : Um
1 : If we wait one more time around then we'll be able to do it.
4 : Like
4 : I would just ah
3 : Ok
4 : Move one shore up
4 : that would be your
3 : Ok ok
4 : final
1 : That's what I would yeah I think that would be a better idea
4 : And then
4 : Draw your Treasure cards
4 : Ok that's good
2 : so I can get rid of this?
1 : Yeah
4 : Yeah
2 : Can I use it?
3 : Ah yeah I think that's what that's what it says. Treasure yeah treasure card
1 : That doesn't count as a turn. I guess you can use it.
3 : Two actions cards.
2 : Yeah
4 : Yeah so
2 : So flip it over
4 : Alright
4 : Well that's good.
2 : Ok
2 : Woo
1 : Yay
2 : Your turn
3 : So did you do
1 : Oh wait you have to do the
4 : Ah
3 : Flood
4 : Flood cards too
2 : Ok Whispering Garden (--)
2 : It's over there.
2 : Ah Crimson Forest and
2 : Dunes of Deception
1 : Crimson
2 : Crimson Forest
1 : That's up there
3 : Ok my turn, I'm blue
2 : Ok
3 : Probably two things best to do is shore up the two
3 : I'm near right now
1 : Yeah probably good idea
4 : Ok so
3 : So I'm just, ah thanks, thanks, thanks.
3 : I got one more action.
2 : You should maybe give me
2 : or
2 : Yeah
3 : Unfortunately
1 : Well then you have too many cards
3 : tell you what
2 : Oh yeah
3 : I could
2 : Hold on
3 : Hold on that
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : I was thinking of like you fly me but that would have been later.
2 : Um
4 : Um
3 : Tell, tell you what, I'm gonna need
1 : (--)
2 : So is it
4 : If
3 : Eventually I'm gonna need to pass off maybe a black ah card to one of you guys.
1 : Yeah well I'm trying to see. If she gives me her two purple then she can give her
4 : So
1 : Two yellow so those will all be
1 : out of the way
4 : So yeah right now I need to be close
1 : So maybe if you
4 : to like so one of my turns will be
4 : move next to her.
1 : Mmhmm
4 : The second one
3 : You need, you need to move us
4 : or wait
4 : You
4 : So can you move her to any
4 : Spot with that
3 : I can move any anybody so
4 : Like
4 : Could you move her
4 : to me?
3 : Let's do that
4 : That way I don't have to use one of my turns.
1 : Yeah that works.
3 : And I've got ah
3 : One more space
1 : That's p
4 : and like that didn't count as a turn for you so
2 : We'll use that later.
1 : Oh yeah it didn't count
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Yeah maybe we should save them.
3 : Ah now I don't want to be on the edge of the board if those uh if those guys sink.
1 : Yeah so just fly over.
3 : So I'm
4 : Um
4 : Oh wait how many turns do you have left?
3 : I got one one action, I have not used my Pilot move
4 : Just one ok
2 : Yeah you
3 : So I want to uh
2 : Yeah you sh
3 : Might as well head over here.
4 : Ok
3 : I've taken three actions
3 : now I draw two Treasure Deck cards uh
3 : Treasure Deck.
3 : K
1 : Now wait, wait see
2 : And hopefully no Water Rise ok.
1 : Ok good.
3 : Well and
4 : Good
3 : I got a tough choice here.
1 : I would discard one of the purple ones because we're not gonna need it.
4 : Yeah like
3 : Ok hmm hmm
4 : Assuming nothing goes too bad
3 : Ok so I have- I've done the card stuff, now the ah water stuff. What do we have here?
4 : Right now what should we do
3 : Cave of Shadows, Tidal Palace, Silver Gate
3 : That's Cave of Shadows, Silver Palace
1 : Silver Gate
3 : Tidal Palace
1 : Tidal
1 : Ok
4 : Ok so
3 : Thank you very much.
4 : Two of them are Treasure cards.
1 : Mmhmm
3 : I'm done.
4 : so
4 : Alright um
4 : I guess
4 : So if I want to give both of these to you
4 : That's two turns
3 : Actually one turn it says uh you may give one or more your Treasure cards to another player.
4 : Oh
3 : Oh s hold
4 : Ok
3 : It costs one action for each card, I'm sorry. It really, it really is that I'm sorry.
1 : Ok that's fine.
4 : Yeah
4 : Well
1 : S
4 : I will just
4 : I'll give two of these so that's two turns and then shore up that. Does that sound good?
1 : Yup
3 : Perfect, perfect.
1 : I think that's a good idea.
4 : Oh ok
4 : And there's that
1 : So then I can just move and claim it and we're
1 : on a roll
1 : oh yeah we can ri-win pretty quickly if we give her the fire one.
4 : (--)
3 : Fingers crossed.
4 : Ok um Treasure cards
3 : K
1 : Sorry
4 : Ok
4 : I'm just gonna
4 : Discard these now
4 : Can I just do that now cause
4 : We're not gonna use
2 : Which ones are we aiming for? Yeah.
1 : We don't need (--)
4 : Like we already have that so I'm just getting rid of these though
2 : Ok
3 : I'm
3 : Are we allowed to do that any time we wanna sh? I th (think)
4 : Oh I'll keep 'em then.
2 : I mean yeah just give them they're like five.
3 : I I guess we got, I think we gotta hold on until we have five.
1 : Here you go
4 : Ok
4 : Ok Howling Gardens.
4 : Cave of
4 : Embers and Bronze
4 : Gate
1 : And then

4 : um
3 : So
4 : I would
3 : I should
1 : Oh yeah you can just
4 : sh
3 : I could ju- I could use my
3 : Now
4 : first I would shore up
4 : Then I would fly, then I would capture the treasure
3 : Yeah
3 : Perfect we're doing it
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok
1 : Mm
3 : Pilot can jump
1 : Two
3 : I play as my third action these four
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok we have three now so that's
1 : That's all we need, so should you
2 : use the
2 : Fly everyone
1 : should you
1 : fly us all to
4 : Um
3 : I can move from one tile to another tile
4 : So you can, you have, they have to be on the same, so you can move us there.
2 : Ah
1 : You can move both of them
1 : And then I can use mine on my turn
1 : to move
3 : Actually, you don't you can play at any time
4 : Yeah
3 : We got, we got
2 : Oh yeah you can play at any time too.
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Oh I can play at any time too oh ok that's right.
4 : So
2 : Yeah so we both play it everyone go on Fool's Landing
3 : So we're we- so the moment
3 : We could we could win this on your turn, ah ah ah can we do that?
1 : We can just win it now.
3 : All all of us have to get to Fool's Landing
2 : Yeah
4 : Well you could fly
4 : Yeah just
2 : Just
2 : Just
4 : So you fly us to there
4 : We need one in the end though
1 : You can use your pilot move
4 : Right
1 : Yeah I have two
4 : Ok so
1 : So if you use your pilot move
3 : I fly I fly
1 : fly there then use your card, fly both of them
4 : He's
4 : Well he used three already
3 : Ok
4 : Cause he
1 : Oh
3 : Yeah one
4 : Capture the treasure. I think that's
1 : I see
3 : Shore up, I've used my three actions already
1 : I see ok
3 : So
3 : Let me just, just get my turn finished, see what floods
2 : Well it's coming back
4 : Well
4 : That doesn't count as an action though so
3 : Mmhmm
4 : If you want to
4 : move us now you could but
4 : I guess if you could play it at any time it doesn't matter
4 : I
4 : Um
2 : But we
2 : have three we should play play all of the Helicopter
3 : Yeah, yeah, mmhmm I, I can get myself over on my turn I'm afraid, unless we get a Helicopter card.
2 : Cards
1 : Yeah
3 : So the rest of you
2 : Oh
2 : Oh you need to be on the same, ok
3 : Rest, rest
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Rest of you, rest of you guys
4 : Yeah
3 : Now
3 : Ok
4 : Unless
3 : Ah
3 : Tell you, I'll tell you what
4 : Mm
4 : Unless you want to wait
4 : Until her turn, she moves there
4 : and then
4 : move all three of us at one time, I don't know
1 : But yeah unless like because we still have to pick all of the flooding cards, so I don't know if anything would flood.
3 : Good idea.
4 : Yeah
4 : Like
4 : So do you think we should just
3 : Tell
3 : Tell yah
4 : draw cards take my turn
3 : tell ya, tell ya what, tell ya what
3 : We can go helicopter lift here
3 : you helicopter lift you three there
3 : and you'll have to wait till it comes around to my turn and then we could probably win this.
4 : Ok
3 : Sound like a good plan?
4 : Yeah so you'll have to draw treasure cards
2 : mmhmm
4 : before we do anything
1 : should I do it now or
3 : Ah
3 : Tell you what, hold on there if something needs shoring.
3 : So
1 : Ok just
1 : We'll go around one more time just just in case
3 : Ok?
4 : Yeah let's let's just go quickly though
3 : Ok.
1 : oh yeah we have like five minutes left
3 : Two
3 : Yeah trea- two treasure cards cause I've played my three actions
3 : Oh Sandbags
1 : might as well just use it
3 : Here
2 : Ok
2 : Whispering Garden
2 : Silver Gate and Dunes of Deception
2 : is that three? Yeah
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Mmhmm
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
4 : Um
3 : tell you, tell you what, I don't
4 : Do you want me to just shore up something while
3 : t-
4 : on my turn?
1 : yeah probably
3 : I don't want to get sunk
2 : Yeah just go ahead do it
1 : Yeah I understand
3 : Yeah
1 : Ok
3 : So on to your turn then?
4 : And
4 : that's gonna be all I do I think
1 : yeah then my turn I'll can shore up those ones
2 : and move
4 : ah well I
2 : right?
4 : have to
4 : I don't draw these I guess
3 : just
3 : Yeah Mmhmm
1 : alright
1 : (There's these ones)
4 : ok ah Temple of the Moon
4 : Breaker's Bridge and Lost Lagoon
1 : Lost Lagoon
1 : Alright
4 : Ah wait did you just do ok
1 : so was it
1 : Yeah I I just did that, so is it my turn now?
4 : Yeah
1 : Alright so I'll do, I'll like
1 : Shore up those
4 : And then you can move over to us
1 : Shore up
1 : thee-
3 : Yeah I think
1 : These as a turn
1 : and move over
1 : Then should I fly us over?
3 : Tell you what if if you fly your your group
4 : Oh whoops I just
4 : hold on
1 : Oh then you can fly you and I can use this
3 : Mmhmm
1 : Ok so
1 : Helicopter
2 : Well y you can shore up first
3 : She used her
4 : wait
1 : I already did it
4 : She used her turns
2 : Oh
1 : Yeah
2 : But
2 : All three?
4 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
4 : Cause she shored up
3 : Yeah
4 : Twice and
3 : Moved
2 : Twice but that's one
4 : moved once
1 : I moved
1 : Yeah so
2 : Oh ok
3 : Helicopter yourself over
1 : I'll helicopter us off over
2 : But I thought you were shoring up, twice counts as one
1 : I did I shored up twice, twice then moved
2 : Oh ok ok ok
3 : Mmhmm
3 : I'm Helicoptering to get to Fool's Landing too
1 : And then I'm gonna Helicopter us all away
1 : Yay
2 : Wait we skipped over my part.
4 : It doesn't matter
2 : Oh no that's it, yeah ok.
4 : Where
2 : Oh that was like stressful towards the end so I was like Ah
4 : Yeah
4 : Well it was like the time it was like
4 : Oh ok
3 : And we gotta do this again
1 : Yeah
1 : I know. At least we're better at it.
2 : Ah this is great though, yeah.
2 : Great teamwork guys.
4 : Yeah that was good
1 : We kind a know what we're doing
3 : Yeah yeah teamwork
4 : I know I'm not very good at things like this

1 : Oh so I go first right?
1 : Yeah ok
1 : I'm gonna
1 : What do you guys think?
1 : I know I can move here.
1 : I guess
1 : sh
1 : Shore up
1 : These
1 : two?
1 : And
3 : you can't do it diagonally.
1 : Oh
1 : So don't (--) I'll do the one I'm on
3 : But you can be on
3 : you can be on the same tile.
1 : And then
1 : What else? Any other advice?
1 : This one too?
3 : Mm, let me see.
3 : That was
3 : Now see that was just two
1 : Yeah but as the Engineer can do
2 : Yeah
1 : two
3 : And that was
1 : As one
3 : two
2 : Oh so you had extra.
1 : So I have one more like
1 : move
2 : Ah ok
3 : Ok
3 : Huh
1 : So I might as well right?
3 : Ok
1 : Ok and now I get what two treasures?
3 : Right here
1 : Yeah can you just give me two?
1 : Ok so I have
1 : One of these so this has to go
1 : Up and then I
1 : take two
2 : Hold on
1 : of these
1 : Oh we have to shuffle these first and put them on top.
2 : (--)
1 : Ok
1 : Lost Lagoon and Gold Gate
1 : Oh this is sunk now.
1 : And there's Lost Lagoon.
3 : This
1 : And that's sunk too
1 : Ok and this goes in the discard
1 : And then do I have to draw two more Flood cards?
1 : I guess so
1 : phantom Rock and Cliffs of Abandon
2 : Hmm
2 : What?
1 : So I don't have to do that even though I already got that card? Ok cool.
2 : Yeah
1 : So this stays
1 : Like that
1 : Ok now your turn
2 : Ok we already moved that up, that's all
1 : Yeah
2 : Alright
2 : Where's my piece?
2 : What am I trying to go for?
2 : Does anyone know how we actually
2 : capture
2 : the
1 : The Treasure?
2 : The Treasure again?
1 : You have to have all four of these cards.
2 : And then be on that?
1 : And then and then be on one of them yeah
3 : You have to be on the corresponding-
2 : Ok
2 : So how is this
2 : We move that in this direction
2 : shore up, there's nothing really to shore up.
2 : There's give a treasure card
1 : You don't, you don't have to do all three.
2 : Capture a treasure
2 : I'll just
2 : move here and then
2 : Um
2 : (--)
2 : And um I guess, what should we do
2 : Draw two treasure cards in the deck.
2 : Then
2 : I can
2 : (--)
2 : Draw flood cards equal to the water level
2 : So two
2 : (--) draw the flood cards.
2 : Cliffs of Abandon and Phantom Rock
2 : This one
2 : And that one
3 : You said the Cliffs?
2 : Yes
2 : Um
2 : Is that it?
1 : I think you're good
2 : And
2 : (--) we don't have to move this.
3 : No
1 : Yeah
1 : Yeah I think we're good
2 : (--)
3 : It's my turn.
3 : I'll stick here.
3 : two
3 : and
3 : Where's Breaker's Bridge?
2 : Breaker's Bridge
1 : Here it is.
1 : Hm
1 : Now
1 : Shore up these two
1 : and then
1 : move
1 : here
1 : And
1 : And then
1 : I guess
1 : take
1 : like
1 : Yeah two
3 : W-
1 : what you have an idea?
3 : Wait do you
3 : Do you have two or three turns?
3 : Was that your-
1 : Three, I have one more
3 : I would
3 : because
3 : Cause we I have
3 : one of, cause you have two of those and I have one
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Just in case you get the fourth one I would suggest moving closer to there.
1 : Ok which one, this one or this one?
3 : I would go
3 : Right here
1 : Ok
1 : Alright now I'll take two
1 : Oh
1 : Smart
2 : (--)
2 : We can only have five at any given time.
1 : Yeah so I'm good cause this doesn't count as one.
2 : Ok
1 : Ok now two of these
1 : Ah Temple of the Moon and Iron Gate.
2 : Ok
2 : Before (--)
2 : (--) time (--)
2 : Does not count as an action to discard
2 : Should I shore up something right now? It doesn't hurt to not have an extra card in my hand.
2 : I don't want to draw before, I don't want to be over five at any point so.
3 : Mm
2 : I will probably while it's
2 : Still your turn um use my shore to
2 : Would it be advisable to shore up? Um
3 : We have more of these so
2 : What should we go for?
3 : keep that one.
3 : Shore up the Howling Garden.
2 : Alright, shore up Howling Garden.
3 : It's over here
2 : Uh ok
2 : Alright now
2 : I could take up to three actions.
2 : I should probably
3 : unless you
2 : Mm
2 : Move yourself up
2 : I will I will move myself up, undo this one
3 : Yeah
2 : Ok I guess
2 : that counts as another action one
2 : two
2 : and I guess I can, can I move myself again?
1 : Yeah cause you still have a third one.
2 : ok
2 : so I would
2 : Then move myself back down to ah
2 : um I should probably make my way to one of you two cause I can transfer one of your guys's
2 : um I can transfer the either you two can meet
2 : and
2 : you know do a swap. Swap for a swap actually that'd probably be advisable
3 : Mmhmm
2 : And then
2 : you know
2 : plan on doing something else from there.
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Um
1 : (--)
2 : Did I draw two treasure cards already?
1 : No you still have to do that.
3 : Yeah well
3 : Yeah I think cause we're closer to the Cave of Embers where we need.
3 : So
2 : Ok
2 : That's good so you guys can meet.
2 : Alright so sorry I have to
2 : It's gonna have to raise the water level.
1 : So you have to shuffle these.
2 : Ok
1 : now you draw three.
2 : One
2 : two
2 : three
2 : So Breaker's Bridge
2 : Cliffs of Abandonment
2 : and Phantom Rock
3 : Bye, bye phantom
1 : So that
2 : Wow
1 : card has to go too
2 : should I put that over there?
2 : Thank you
3 : Yeah
1 : I think that's it
2 : That's it
3 : ok
3 : Mm
3 : I'm going to
3 : which one, which color
3 : are you again?
1 : Red
3 : Ok
3 : I'm gonna move
3 : Here
3 : You're red ok
3 : One
3 : two and then if we're on the same tile just give you this
1 : Yeah and then I think I have to get rid of one.
1 : So I guess I'll get rid of this one.
2 : Yeah
1 : Since we have
3 : Yeah
1 : More of the yellow people.
1 : Ugh
1 : Ok so now is my turn
1 : So I'll trade in these. Oh wait sorry you have to draw your two treasure.
3 : Oh right
2 : And do the whole flood thing
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
1 : And then
1 : the two flood cards too
3 : Oh three
1 : Oh three right?
3 : Ok
3 : Ok gotta say good-bye to Iron Gate
3 : Uh Whispering Garden
3 : Whispering Garden
3 : and then Temple of the Moon
1 : Ok it's my turn
1 : Ok
1 : Can I do like can I shore up one that's like adjacent to one that's already
3 : Oh
2 : Oh
1 : Oh
1 : Can I
1 : like
1 : Since this is adjacent to this?
1 : Shore up both of them or does it have to be to me?
2 : Um you probably can only do one block over.
1 : You see what I'm saying?
1 : Ok
1 : Ok so I'll do
1 : One and then I'll move here.
2 : Shore up or-
1 : and then I'll do the four of these
2 : Before you move before we
2 : Can we go back? Before you move can you trade right?
1 : Yeah
2 : oh
2 : Yeah that probably would be best. I was gonna say-
1 : I was gonna shore up, move and then trade in these four.
2 : Yeah (--) Cliffs of Abandon.
2 : Um
2 : It might be better.
2 : If we
2 : um
2 : tra- gave her
2 : Actually yeah you're right you don't want to give her then she does that automatically discard.
2 : Alright you could always just do it later you're right. I'm sorry
1 : No, no you're fine.
2 : Continue
1 : Ok so we'll leave that one shored up.
2 : Continue
1 : And then
2 : Alright
2 : Did you want to do this one?
1 : Well then it would be
2 : Oh yeah you shored it up.
1 : Ok so I'll move there and then
1 : if I trade in these
1 : four
1 : Then I get
1 : this
1 : creature
3 : creature
1 : Ok and then I get two treasure
1 : Ok
1 : and then three floods
1 : So
1 : Copper Gate
3 : Copper Gate
1 : Oh this one.
1 : Crimson Forest
1 : and Howling Garden.
1 : Now it's your turn.
2 : Now it's my turn so I can take up to three actions, I probably should do some unflooding.
2 : Um
2 : Is Crimson Forest really needed anymore? I don't think it's really ever, it's even needed.
2 : So first I'm, should I unshore what I'm on?
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : One
3 : Ah
3 : cause we have all four here now
3 : and you're close
3 : Where are you?
3 : Right here?
2 : Yeah
3 : So y ou're closest to Temple of the Moon
2 : Hmm
3 : So
2 : I should probably start collecting these as well
3 : Start collecting those
3 : and then make your way towards Temple of the Moon
3 : Trying to figure that out
2 : Yeah
2 : Are there are any other um
2 : you don't want to lose a-uh
2 : a rock place I guess
2 : So
3 : Ok
2 : is there, is this a rock place?
1 : No so there's Temple of the Moon and Temple of the Sun
2 : Oh no
2 : Oh ok as long as we protect like those two.
2 : So should I
3 : So I mean if anything floods I have two lift cards if we need to
3 : I think that's how it works
1 : Yeah you can swim away
3 : Yeah
1 : Well if you're on the tile right?
3 : If you're on it. We only have if I'm on the tile.
2 : I can't give that in yet
2 : So
2 : First
2 : Should I
2 : I'm gonna unshore this?
2 : I should.
2 : (--) this
3 : Unshore that
3 : and then
2 : Ok
2 : So one action
2 : Draw
2 : Second action should be
2 : Probably move over here.
2 : Second
1 : Well
1 : you don't want to get too far from us cause if we're gonna trade these cards to you we have to be on the same tile as you.
2 : Ah
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So you could like
1 : shore up this one and then move to her tile
2 : I have two actions but what do you want to start collecting next and what should she start collecting next?
2 : Maybe
2 : um I should
2 : take your guys's rocks from you I guess?
2 : And then
3 : Yeah
2 : Um
2 : Take your guys's rocks from you
2 : and then if you can possibly move me over to this really soon?
2 : or one of these and I can then
3 : Yeah
2 : take that piece.
3 : Yeah
1 : Yeah
3 : Which treasure have we decided to give up?
3 : Did we?
3 : We decide, we're not going to need the chalice cause we already discarded one chalice card.
2 : Ok
3 : So if you have more
3 : then you can just get rid of the chalice and we'll still have
3 : this
3 : and that to take care of
3 : cause we already have one
2 : ok
2 : So should I sh-
2 : so instead I should move towards you guys and then
3 : Yeah and then pass
1 : because you can give us cards without being on the same tile as us but we have to be on the same tile as you to give you cards.
2 : Yeah
2 : Definitely
3 : And then we can lift towards the Temple if it doesn't sink.
1 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : Or can't you lift people too?
3 : That's it.
3 : Yeah I
3 : I can lift people. Let me see
3 : Can I lift people?
3 : Well
2 : Can- what's the Pilot?
2 : The Pilot can move.
3 : Well I can
3 : move myself.
3 : That's it.
2 : Is this your ability thing?
2 : Once per turn fly
2 : to yeah
3 : I can go to any tile.
1 : Ok
3 : But
2 : You can go to any tile.
3 : we do have a problem
3 : If Temple of the Moon sinks we only have Temple of
2 : We have this one.
3 : Ok but
3 : I guess I can
3 : I can
3 : If I get, if you can give me
3 : the other two if we meet up then I can fly towards Temple of the Sun and get this
3 : that's
1 : So how many moves do you have left?
2 : Oh I have two
2 : so
3 : you have two
2 : but yours are- these two- remember you can only have the five cards so
3 : Oh wait ah shoot yeah
2 : These are very important. So probably while it's my turn I would recommend
2 : Sandbags
2 : aren't probably something you should probably just hold on to anyways if you can
3 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : Maybe
3 : Ok
1 : Well also we
2 : You can only have up to five at one time so you can't continue to have too many cards.
1 : We're
1 : Both these two are in danger of being sunk too and we have, we still have to get that one.
2 : Oh definitely
3 : Ah cr- yeah that's true
2 : So while it's still my turn and since you can use this at any time it would probably be best to
2 : u se it right now, instead of waiting till your turn.
3 : Ok
3 : What do you want me to shore up? Temple of the Moon?
3 : Or
3 : or one of
1 : I would do one of these cause if we draw like these two then we're done.
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok I think we're closest to that one ok
2 : I thought
2 : Yeah
2 : Ok
1 : And then you can move
1 : here
1 : so that on her turn she can no
1 : it would make more sense for her to move to you
2 : So should we all should we focus our
2 : our
2 : should we migrate south I should say ok.
1 : Migrate downward
2 : I have two moves, so
2 : Um
2 : can how about we give you the
2 : the you will head for the Howling
1 : Ok
2 : Howling Gardens
2 : So
2 : since I have
2 : two
2 : I should probably- well I gotta meet with you guys anyways
2 : So
1 : You could like shore up this while you're here and then move there or something
2 : I'm gonna at least
3 : Mm
2 : Well since we don't need Crimson Forest anymore since we already have it and Temple- and we're already just trying to save this one
1 : Oh ok yeah
1 : Ok
2 : You might as well just like
3 : Yeah
1 : Keep going down
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : who should I
2 : I don't really have
1 : I mean you don't have to take both of them you can do just one too
2 : two
2 : Ok
2 : Yeah
2 : That's true
2 : Go
2 : That's my second move
2 : and then
2 : trade
2 : Oh wait a minute you guys have to give me the card huh?
1 : Mmhmm
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah
2 : Should I, should I move again?
1 : You can
1 : You might as well just
3 : as, as I, as I said if you have, cause we're not going to need this anymore.
2 : Oh (--)
3 : So if
3 : um
1 : If you want to draw your two treasures
2 : Yeah ok
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh no another Water Rise, and not a good card
2 : So would you mind- did you move it up one?
1 : Yes
2 : Thank you
1 : Oh these have to be shuffled.
2 : Alright, well
2 : (--)
1 : Then you draw three.
2 : One
2 : two
2 : three
3 : Yep
3 : See
2 : So Crimson Forest
2 : bye bye
2 : Ah Howling Garden
3 : Ok
2 : And
2 : Temple of the Moon
1 : Temple of the Moon
3 : Yep
2 : Alright we're
2 : We're invested now in this
3 : I told you this was
3 : Just ok
2 : (--)
3 : So
3 : Oh it's my turn
3 : Ok
3 : I'm trying to think of what I should do
2 : Probably
2 : It'd be best to give me
1 : Give him the
2 : Give me one
1 : Thing, yeah
3 : Ok
1 : Then you have to discard something
2 : I have to discard one
3 : Discard the chalice
2 : Alright
1 : We also don't need this one
1 : because we alreadxy got it- all of them.
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah ok um
2 : Well let's just discard the Crimson just to be on the safe, safe, safe side.
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : In case like you know something
3 : Ok
2 : really bad happens
3 : And then
3 : Ok
3 : I can move anywhere so I can move to
3 : this
3 : I can move the Temple and then use the lift to take you guys.
2 : Oh actually
2 : Mhm
1 : I would move to like one of these and then sink that one or move there and save it
3 : Move here?
3 : This?
1 : And then
1 : Yeah
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : And that would be three moves right?
2 : Ok
3 : Oh
3 : Is that three?
1 : Yeah cause you gave and then you moved and then you
3 : Ok
3 : Ok that makes sense
3 : Oh I got another lift low and behold
2 : Ah
2 : That's good
3 : Alright and then draw three flood cards was it?
1 : Yeah
3 : Don't forget that.
1 : No you only do that on Water's Rises
3 : Oh ok
3 : Ok
3 : Copper Gate
3 : Uh Cliffs of Abandon
3 : and Breaker's Bridge
2 : Bye Breaker's
3 : adios muchacho
1 : Ok
1 : Now
1 : I'm gonna move
1 : Here and give you
1 : this
2 : Ok
2 : That's good so I discard
3 : Yeah
3 : Just discard the chalice
2 : What?
1 : and then advice for what to do next
2 : Mm
2 : Can I give you
2 : Oh should we give
3 : well I ca-
2 : The Griffin's too. Maybe you should give me the Griffins
3 : Yeah it's set
2 : Oh no I can only- yeah that would probably be a bad idea anyways
3 : I was gonna s-
1 : Well once you trade those in
3 : Um it says I can play this at any time
2 : Ok
3 : So
3 : if you want
2 : Um what we can do, we can play these at any time?
3 : Play this at any time. I have so many lift cards.
2 : Ok
2 : This is good because I guess when it becomes my turn I'll be able to
3 : Yeah
2 : give
3 : yeah cause I'm already here at Howling Garden
2 : Who should I give
3 : That's where you can collect this
2 : Ok
3 : I have three of these
2 : Who should we
2 : give the Griffin's to?
3 : Mm
1 : Probably you cause you already have two.
3 : Yeah give the- give the Griffins to me and I can fly you guys over here so you can collect well
2 : (--)
2 : So should
2 : So
3 : Um
3 : I can move you towards Temple of the Sun where you can just give to
2 : That would probbaly be best
3 : Ok
2 : (--)
3 : So I'll use this and
1 : Well he can't do that until his turn. He can't trade in those four cards.
3 : Ah it's not your turn?
2 : That's not yeah
1 : No it's mine, I have two moves left.
3 : Ok
1 : No
3 : I mean you don't
1 : one
1 : Cause I moved and then I gave him a card so I have one move left
2 : Might as well shore up something I guess?
3 : Ok
1 : Yeah just
2 : (--)
1 : This one?
3 : Yeah
2 : Yeah maybe
1 : Well I can do two so I can do these two
2 : Well there's, well there's not point, well yeah yeah, ok, yeah
1 : I mean, might as well it gives us more
3 : Just in
2 : Doesn't hurt yeah
1 : more space
3 : I guess just in case ok
1 : Ok
1 : And then I get two Treasures please.
3 : (--)
1 : Ok
1 : and three floods
1 : two
1 : Ok
1 : Um Silver Gate
1 : Cave of Embers
1 : And Whispering Garden oh this is gone
3 : Yup
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
1 : And now it's your turn
2 : Ok so for my turn it would probably be best to just fly me somewhere really quick
3 : Fly you here?
2 : Ok
2 : So for my first action
2 : I will
1 : These go in the discard
2 : And then
2 : That's one action then who should I
2 : who should
2 : the
2 : Griffin go to
3 : Well I'm already here yeah
2 : You're already on the Griffins
1 : I guess just take two
1 : Well you, you're the Messenger so you can give, you don't have to be on the same tile, you can just give
2 : yeah
1 : you might as well just give it to her
3 : Yeah you don't, you don't have to be on the same tile as me.
2 : So we have
2 : We have two
1 : So I would say just
3 : Cause I have
3 : Yeah
1 : Sorry go ahead.
3 : Cause I have, cause I have the most.
1 : Yeah so I would say give that to her and then start making your way here cause we all have to end up here.
2 : Mmhmm
1 : Don't leave.
3 : And we got twelve minutes.
2 : Ok
1 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : So
2 : Give that to you
3 : So give it to me
1 : and then I would say just like
1 : start
1 : use your third action to just start heading back
2 : Just start heading on, heading on back
2 : Ok
3 : Ok
2 : Draw two
2 : Um
2 : And next one's the flood.
2 : draw floods
2 : Equal to the level
2 : (--) one, two, three
3 : Don't forget the shuffle
1 : No you only do that on Waters Rises.
2 : Oh that's right
3 : Ah
2 : One
2 : Two
2 : Three
2 : So Bronze Gate
3 : Bronze Gate
2 : Coral Palace
1 : Ok
2 : and Dunes of Deception
3 : Ok
3 : Ah
3 : Ok
3 : I'm going to
3 : Go right here
3 : I guess
2 : Mm why don't
2 : you really
2 : How should I put this, you have five cards already
3 : Yeah
2 : and you're gonna draw some really soon right?
3 : Yeah
2 : So
2 : we need at least one lift
2 : To, to get us out of here
3 : ok
2 : So if we should probably use the lift since this is going to be her turn next
3 : Yeah
2 : to
1 : Fly me to her
2 : fly you to her
3 : Yeah ok
3 : That
1 : I mean you don't have to take any actions too.
2 : But now that, now that she at you though can you guys, oh yeah she's got to give it
3 : Yeah
1 : I have to wait until it's my turn
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
1 : So like you might as well just
1 : Since we're there just draw your two treasures and
3 : Ok
3 : Ok
3 : And
3 : I'm not gonna need that.
3 : And then do I have to get flood cards?
1 : Yeah three

3 : and Tidal Palace is right here.
2 : Oh, sorry
1 : Ok so
1 : I will give you this
3 : And I'll discard that
1 : And then
1 : I'm going to go
1 : Um ok so we'll have all
1 : four so on your turn you can trade them in and then fly us out.
3 : yeah
1 : Ok

2 : We sho- probably, we should all start heading to Fool
1 : Yeah
2 : Fool's Landing.
3 : Yeah we can just
2 : She can get there at any time using the Pilot so
1 : So I'll go here and then here?

3 : Mmhmm
2 : I don't think you're in danger of, of
2 : drowning.
3 : Yeah I'm fine

1 : Oh (--) Fool's Landing, ok, um
1 : Let's move there
1 : Abandon Cliffs
2 : You can only shore up tiles that
2 : you are adjacent to, so you can't do that one, you can do
2 : either of these two.
1 : Oh that's right I'm sorry. Good, thank you
4 : Oh
1 : Messenger
1 : Um
4 : But not diagonal
1 : I can't diagonally, so it has to be these two

1 : safely
4 : It's sunk or it's just flooded?
1 : for now.

2 : What was the name of it?
1 : Um
2 : Well
3 : These
4 : You're both here
2 : Wh- What were the two? What were they called?
3 : Gold Gate, Phantom Rock

2 : Well I'm just- I was just seeing if
2 : those two
1 : The treasures
2 : Yeah
3 : Ok
4 : Oh
4 : oh that could be a problem.
2 : Because with those would be bad if we sink the ones with the treasures in them,
4 : Yeah
4 : Oh yeah
1 : Right
2 : possible.
4 : Good point.
1 : So I need this
2 : Um
3 : K um so it's my turn
2 : so you're up.
2 : Mmhmm
3 : Should I go
2 : So you can move

2 : doesn't matter.
4 : Probably really doesn't matter right now
3 : Yeah, right now
2 : Doesn't matter right now, no
3 : Um, I'll go to
3 : Here
2 : You can't move diagonal
3 : But I can fly anywhere,
3 : right?
2 : Oh, does that count as a- Oh, ok
3 : I think
2 : Sure
3 : Right?
3 : Anyway
1 : (--)
2 : Oh what does your card say?
4 : Would you- What does your thing say?
3 : It just says fly to any tile on the island for one action.
2 : Oh yeah, you can go anywhere. So you can go anywhere on the board, ok
4 : Oh
1 : Ok
4 : You could go across the whole board
3 : Yeah
3 : so I'm gonna go there and then
3 : Mm
3 : then what should I do?
2 : You can shore up but
2 : you're not next to anything, so.
3 : Can I
3 : fly somewhere else again?
4 : I think move is one action you've already done.
2 : Yeah, I think so too.
4 : I don't think you can move again.
3 : I (heard) you
2 : Um
2 : Uh you can't do anything, so I think you're
3 : Yeah
4 : There really isn't anything you can do, just pick up cards.
1 : (--)
2 : turn is up.
2 : Yeah, I think you can just pick up cards.
2 : So like ok, so next time
1 : Where are (--)
3 : Alright
2 : you
2 : move
2 : think about
2 : more carefully where you move to, because
2 : that may be important
4 : Yeah, uh I mean, as we move along it's gonna get more- We have to really be watching what we're doing
3 : Mm
2 : Hard, yeah I think
2 : I think right now it's ok, alright
3 : Ok
2 : So you'll have two Treasure cards, did you pick them up?
3 : Yeah I just got
3 : I got- I have two Helicopter Lifts right now, so I can

1 : And then I
1 : Right
2 : Is that what- That's the rule, you can't shore up two random things right?
3 : Mmhmm
1 : So when I move from here to here they were both next to me
2 : Yeah
3 : Yeah
2 : Perfect, ok, (--)
3 : One, two
1 : Ok
2 : So two Treasure cards
3 : Ok

1 : Lost Lagoon,
4 : K
1 : Cliffs of Abandon,
1 : No
2 : (--), that's gone.
4 : That's sunk now, (--)

2 : Wow
3 : K you're turn
2 : it's happening a lot
1 : The Engineer is done.
4 : I know, I, I, I wasn't thinking that, that so many things would disappear
2 : ou're rightfaster than I thought it would.
3 : You have a sandbag though.
2 : I do have a sandbag, I think I'm going to use it
3 : Mm
2 : on
3 : Whispering?
2 : Um yeah, I'm gonna use it on Whispering Garden?
4 : We need that
3 : Mmhmm
1 : And can you also give

2 : (--) can use the (--) anytime.
2 : Hold on
2 : Ok
2 : What, I'm sorry
1 : Can you also give the Explorer the Lion?
2 : Yeah so that's one card, so I have, first my
2 : turn is to move though, so I just- I'm just
1 : Yes
2 : I'm gonna move
2 : here, actually, so we can be- Oh that's not me, sorry
4 : That's me
4 : But you can move with me
2 : What am I doing?
2 : I'm thinking- Would it help if we were on the same tile, because
1 : (--)
4 : I don't
3 : Wait do you have
4 : Er
4 : You, you
2 : Then it doesn't matter cause I can give you my card anyway
4 : Yo-
4 : you can give me your card anytime.
2 : Ok
2 : I guess I'll go here, right, and I can give you
2 : this card
4 : Ok
2 : um
2 : and I can
4 : (--), three
2 : shore
3 : Well you don't have to- I can
3 : On the next turn-
3 : Oh yeah actually (--)
3 : Yeah, I might be able to shore up but you might be able to
3 : the
3 : Whispering Garden card might come up, so- I don't yeah I think just using it is better.
2 : Yeah, so I think I would- I think I'm gonna use- So I'm gonna use this and we can shore up
2 : Well actually I'm on the- I'm on the
2 : No you're on that
2 : So I wanna shore this up
2 : K
1 : Ok, ooo good
2 : And so
2 : Did we do that right?
3 : Mm
2 : I moved one, I gave you a card, sh- Used
4 : I think
4 : you shored up- That's three actions
3 : (--)
2 : (--)
2 : Well that's two I think cause this one
3 : It doesn't count as an action
2 : doesn't count as an action so I can
4 : Oh, oh
2 : give a card to another player
3 : Or
2 : You have one
3 : She has the red one
2 : Ok, sure
1 : Ok, now I have five, I can't get anymore
2 : You can't have anymore, ok
3 : Ok
1 : No
2 : That's ok cause your turn just happened anyway
4 : No
2 : hopefully
4 : We- Were you allowed to give two
4 : two, is that- That was two different Treasure cards though
4 : Is that allowed?
2 : Um, well this one is not an action- Does not count as an action.
3 : Yeah
4 : Right, but you gave me a Treasure card- Oh you're the Messenger.
1 : She can because that's- Is that your special power isn't it?
2 : Uh, yeah, yeah, so I can give Treasure cards to anyone
3 : Ok
4 : Ok
1 : Ok, so then you pick up
2 : Wait, wait, wait I think we have to be on the same
4 : Or is that- Oh oh see
1 : Right, we have to have a five
3 : Two, four, five, three, four, five, she has six.
2 : One, two
4 : I have six
1 : Ok, so if that's the case, if you have six or more you must immediately choose and discard
2 : Uh
3 : No!
2 : You have to get rid of one
1 : Choose and discard extra card to the treasure discard pile
3 : Ah
2 : Ok so pick one
1 : Crap
4 : I better do this one
2 : Yeah, do that one
4 : Oh dear
2 : So we can just try and focus on the three, the flames and the
3 : Oh yeah, uh, yeah it's the same.
2 : Right, let's just try and do that. Uh I don't know
3 : Discard treasure deck
4 : Yeah, yeah, I mean
1 : Ok, that's too bad because now these are no good
4 : We have all of this, whatev-
3 : Yeah, it's the same two

2 : Ok
2 : Well I'm getting two cards so let's see.
2 : K so I have the sandbags and one of these, ah
2 : Wanna give it to you
2 : but I already used my action so my next turn I'm giving you this and then we can have one
4 : Ok
2 : And I take
3 : Mm
1 : If we don't die first.
4 : Well
4 : Do we all- wait a minute, do we all- Does one person have to have all
2 : If we don't
4 : Or do we have
3 : Mm I think
4 : We have all
4 : four amongst us
1 : One person has to have four
2 : Has to be (--)
4 : Ok
2 : And then they have to be on that, so
2 : you're already on
2 : this so we can pick that up, so just give
4 : Uh huh
3 : I can fly you guys there, whoever gets it
4 : Ok
2 : Ok
2 : Also I have to pick up three flood cards, so let's see

2 : I don't know if it matters
4 : I don't know
4 : you had to swim somewhere.
2 : Um, it says up, down
2 : Oh no
2 : It just says if a pawn is on a tile that's removed you must immediately swim to an adjacent tile.
2 : So not this one, right? It was here or was it here?
4 : It was here, so
4 : No it was here
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Ok, so I can only swim here
1 : So it
2 : It's the only place I can go
4 : Huh
4 : What happens if there's no adjacent tile? Do you just
1 : Then you- then we, then we're done.
2 : Then you die, then we're done the game, the game's over.
4 : You just drown
3 : Yeah
1 : Then we're done.
4 : Oh, that's right.
2 : Ok, Dunes of Deception is gone.
3 : No, no, no I just flipped that one for you.
2 : Oh, ok, whoof
3 : I already flipped it.
2 : Ok
3 : Ok, so it's my turn, so
2 : Yeah
4 : Oh my gosh, I'm a nervous wreck
3 : Um
3 : Ok, so which one should I do, so because I am on the same one with you I can give you this card.
2 : Yes, you can
3 : Should I- Do you guys want me to do that first?
1 : Mmhmm
2 : Yeah, you should give me that card.
3 : And I can- I should probably
2 : Pilot us
2 : off it- Yeah, Pilot us to
3 : Um
2 : the Cave
2 : Cave of Embers, or another
3 : No, no, no, well she needs
4 : Why not
2 : Oh, she needs to be there. You can Pilot
3 : Yeah, but I think I need to
4 : You're
4 : You could Pilot us to flood Landing
4 : or Fool's Landing and we can
3 : Fool's Landing?
4 : be there
4 : as we pass around these cards. We're getting
3 : (but is)
2 : You can also Pilot just us
3 : Ok
2 : So you can take us to
3 : But we have to be- yeah, ok
2 : So, what I'm thinking is you can take us to Cave of Embers or
3 : Which ones? One, two, three
2 : (--)
3 : But the thing is we can't go diagonally, only she can. We
2 : Oh, but you can fly us. Don't you have a card?
3 : Yeah, but after we fly here, we can't move
3 : We can't move this way, none of us can move.
2 : Oh, yeah you're right. ok, so then, move us here,
2 : and then when it's her turn she can give me the card and we'll have four.
4 : Don't move me, don't Pilot me
3 : I'll move, I'll move- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no (--)
2 : No, not you
2 : Ok, does that make sense?
3 : What about moving here?
3 : Cause if we move here we have to either move like this but we could at least go like that.
3 : We have a lot more options.
4 : I, I think
4 : that's an ok idea
4 : to put
4 : to go there.
2 : Ok
2 : well
1 : Why don't we wanna move here?
2 : Well
2 : well, she has to be on
4 : Because I have to be on there
1 : Oh because you have to stay- that's right, you have to- I got it, that's right, that's right.
3 : You know?
4 : to capture it
4 : and that's my next turn.
1 : Ok
2 : Should I shore that up
2 : because if someone pulls up the water
3 : Yeah I do
2 : Water card, that might go
4 : Oh
4 : if you can still- Yeah, yeah, if you have that
3 : Yeah
1 : Eh yeah
3 : Yeah
4 : Do it
3 : Do that one
2 : Ok, I'm gonna just do it
2 : I don't wanna take any chances right now, expecially (--)
3 : Ok and where should I move us to?
1 : Ok
2 : I think you should move us- Well, ok this is what I'm thinking
2 : I think
2 : I would
2 : rather us move here because then when it's her turn
2 : you can give me
2 : the
2 : fire
4 : Excellent
2 : and then I'll have four and I'll be on this card
1 : Ok
3 : Oh yeah yeah
1 : Ok
4 : Then you'll already be there
3 : Ok
1 : Alright
2 : So then I don't have to waste another turn being on it, that's what I was thinking, but
1 : Yeah, either
3 : Yeah, yeah, yeah
4 : Ok
1 : Yeah
3 : Ok
2 : If you think Fool's Landing is
3 : (--)
4 : Nah, you're right, we're right next to it so
1 : Yeah, no, no, you're right, you're right
2 : Ok
3 : Yeah
3 : So
1 : You're right Messenger, you're right
3 : What are-
3 : what color are you?
4 : I'm this- I'm the green
2 : So gray and blue Pilot us to
3 : (--)
2 : the Cave of Shadows
1 : Yeah, ok
1 : Alright
3 : And then
1 : Oh gosh
4 : I know
3 : Ok
2 : Oh we don't need those cards anymore- Ok
3 : Doesn't matter
3 : and
3 : I need that.
2 : You need three
1 : (--)
2 : Oh god
3 : Ok
3 : so this one is flooded, the Bronze
3 : This one
2 : No
1 : Ok
3 : In here
4 : What is flooded?
3 : None of them are sunken
2 : Well
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
2 : Oh no
4 : Alright, I'm capturing
2 : Nobody has a sandbag do they?
1 : Alright you're
2 : K I just
4 : Oh wait
2 : Yeah, so you can
4 : Do I have to- I'm capturing
1 : Yeah, it's your turn.
3 : Ok, you can do that
4 : I'm capturing
4 : the wind lion
2 : Cool
1 : Ok, now you
4 : Ok, now I can move or shore up
4 : but I can, I can
2 : Can, can you do both? You should move
3 : Can you
2 : and shore up
3 : This one has that
1 : (--)
4 : That's not adjacent though
2 : No, yeah, she can't
4 : I have- If I wanna move I can move to- I can shore this, I can move that up and
2 : And move there
4 : move that and shore it up.
2 : Yeah, ok well
2 : I mm
4 : Oh oo
4 : No, I can move to there and shore that one up
2 : Yeah, I was thinking that- Well um, yeah, yeah, yes, yes
2 : because we need this one all
1 : Wait, wait, that's me, you're moving me.
4 : No I'm not moving you, I'm just lifting you up.
2 : No, she's just
1 : Ok
1 : Oh you shored me up? Ok
4 : We're just shoring you up
2 : That's, that's, yeah that's good.
1 : Thank you my feet were getting wet.
4 : I wouldn't want- I don't want you to
2 : Alright so now it is- No you need to pull two cards
3 : Are you done?
4 : Oh
4 : Ok
4 : Alright, we'll just um
2 : Ok
3 : (--)
2 : And you need three
1 : Ok
4 : And
2 : I'm pretty nervous because this Cave of Shadows is gonna be (--) so
4 : Ok
4 : watch
2 : If we pull a Water's Up card
4 : Where's the Watchtower? It's
1 : Over there, ok, flood
4 : Flood- It's flooded
4 : Misty Marsh is flooded and Howling Garden
3 : Ok
1 : Ok
4 : W- Oh
4 : Huh ah!
3 : Yay we made it
1 : We skipped through that one, ok, here we go.
2 : Ok
2 : I'm pretty nervous.
1 : Um
1 : let me shore- I'm gonna start by shoring some stuff up
2 : You can't- Can you shore something diagonal to you? No, cause you're not
4 : But
4 : Wait, who, who's
3 : Wait
1 : No, it has to be
3 : she can shore
3 : Oh where are you?
4 : Are you the blu- Are you blue? Oh no, you're red
2 : She's not on there, she's on here
1 : It has to be
2 : Oh
1 : I'm red, so I can shore up these two
4 : Uh
2 : Yeah
4 : But you know what
3 : But we need the
4 : You want
1 : And I can't do that one though, because it's diagonal to me
4 : you can't move diagonally.
3 : Oh yeah
2 : Damn
4 : Oh
1 : Right?
4 : Yeah, because if you
4 : could get there you could give the Messenger
1 : On adjacent tiles yeah, ok
1 : Alright so
1 : now I can move
3 : It's ok, if, if the- If it does come up she can use her Helicopter and just move you here
2 : Yeah but we
2 : Yeah
3 : If, if one of these die, cause we have both anyways. One's gonna
2 : I don't
2 : That's true, ok, we'll, we'll figure it out. We'll get to it when it comes
3 : Yeah
1 : I gotta get rid of a card anyway, I mean it would be probably a good
4 : Well
2 : You could-
1 : thing
2 : You could either give it to me or to her
2 : Actually, you should give it to
3 : (--), she's not on the same one as us
2 : the Pilot
2 : Oh, true, never mind, you can't give any-
3 : She can't
1 : But I, but I didn't move yet, so I could be on-

4 : I'm green
3 : Who's green?
2 : Explorer
1 : You're green
3 : Oh you can't move here.
2 : Move- Oh you can't move. So you have to move to Explorer
1 : Mm
2 : if you were to move
2 : and then you could give her your card.
1 : Yup, I'm gonna do that.
1 : So I, I shored, I moved, give a card
2 : No
3 : No, not that one
2 : No, no, no, not that one

2 : Does someone else wanna shuffle this?
1 : Nope
2 : Uh just in case

4 : We won't blame you, we won't hold it against ya

1 : Ok
1 : we're good with this one, Silver Gate
4 : Ok
1 : Ok, so that's ok.
1 : Crimson Forest
4 : Which card?
2 : Crimson Forest, I just

2 : I don't see it
4 : I don't see it
1 : Where'd it go?

1 : Alright, Messenger
2 : So
2 : so
2 : I can move, but I don't wanna move right now.
2 : I can give my card to someone
2 : I would
3 : Wait, wasn't the point of you staying there so that she could give you a card?
3 : And you can get it?
1 : But I wasn't on the same tile, with her
2 : Yeah, she wasn't on the same card
3 : Yeah
2 : Neither were
3 : Well
2 : neither was the Ex-
3 : Mm, you can use a Hel- never mind, I don't know.
4 : I
2 : Yeah, someone should
2 : give me-
2 : Someone should move me to
2 : either
3 : But you would have to move back
4 : Nope, you're, you're with the Hel-
2 : Oh yeah it doesn't matter- Wait, oh, did we mess this up?
1 : Ok
3 : I say she should, she should have moved
1 : Hmm?
4 : Wait a minute
1 : We can Helicopter at any-
1 : Move one or more pawns in the same tile
3 : Oh, I have an idea. Um why don't you
2 : Why did you and I have to be on the same one? Why did I say that?
1 : If (--)
3 : You- No, no
1 : Play at any time, doesn't not count as an action
3 : Oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.
1 : This card to Treasure Island, so I can move
2 : Can't you just move
1 : you
2 : Just move yourself to here
3 : The thing is she can't give you a card anyways, even if she moves there.
4 : I need to give her a card
2 : Yeah, I thought the point was that
1 : Ok wait
2 : the Explorer was supposed to
4 : Cause I have this
2 : Well yeah
1 : Right, but you
4 : So if you would, if you- Even if you moved me here, I could move diagonally there and then give her this card
1 : But if I move you-
1 : But can't I- I can move you
1 : Move one or more pawns on the same tile to any
1 : to any other tile,
1 : So I could move us here
1 : Oops, hello
4 : Yeah
2 : Yeah, ok do that
1 : Ok
1 : and then this is done.
2 : Yes
3 : Mmhmm
2 : Awesome, so now

1 : Yeah
1 : Right, we have to wait for a turn
3 : Yeah
2 : Oh, no one- I can- Oh I can give out card but nobody can
4 : And then, and then
4 : And then
4 : you have to wait till your turn to capture it
2 : Why
2 : Wait, there was definitely
2 : a reason
3 : Sh-
2 : as to why I wanted
3 : There- She was supposed to give you the card before but we just forgot about it I think.
3 : It's fine, whatever
2 : Oh
1 : Wait, but I was never on the tile with her, I couldn't give her
2 : Oh yeah
3 : But, but, she- You could've rode the Helicopter with her, it's
2 : You had a Helicopter
4 : Oh
3 : I don't know why we didn't think of it
4 : Well we're not experts at this, but we're working well as a team, right?
3 : Yeah
1 : I think so
3 : Ok, so (--)
2 : Wow

1 : I have four
2 : You have four and you also have four so it doesn't matter.
1 : Yeah cause
