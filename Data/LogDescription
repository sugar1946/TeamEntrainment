    Record the 1 quater and 4th quater interval convergence (weighted and nonweighted)

weighted convergence analysis 2:
   1/23/2018 from Zahra
   Using the weighted convergence to predict the ???. She tried different models here such as svc rbf/sigmoid, random forest. logistic regression. She also created fake game and use the convergence from the fake game to predict the ??? and compare the predicting result with real game.
