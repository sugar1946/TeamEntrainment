1 : alright
2 : ok let me just review here
1 : alright so it's my turn first
3 : yes
1 : i guess i should
1 : save these two thingies
1 : but this one's not as important i don't think, cause it's on the end
1 : so i'll go here for my first move
1 : and i'll flip over these two,
1 : cause i can flip two.
1 : and i guess i'll flip this one
1 : while i'm at it
1 : and then
1 : take two of those.
1 : aw shoot
1 : so we're gonna move this thingy up one,
1 : shuffle these,
1 : and then i'm gonna draw two of them.
1 : so phantom rock,
1 : alright we lost it already.
1 : that was fast
2 : hmm hmm hmm hmm
1 : and then
3 : it's ok
1 : temple of the moon
1 : that's the one i'm on
3 : yeah
1 : that was clutch
2 : ooo
3 : aw, good job
1 : i need to discard that one
1 : and
1 : is that all?
1 : yeah
1 : that's exactly what it says, ok
3 : that goes in the treasure one
1 : yup
2 : ok,
2 : so it's my turn.
1 : mm
2 : ok, so i get to move
2 : one place
2 : umm
2 : oh wait
2 : ok
1 : those are the treasure cards.
1 : not gonna really do much right now
2 : ok
2 : alright so
2 : i move one,
2 : pull two,
1 : is that
1 : the end is that all you wanna do?
2 : uh or i could sink something right?
1 : or
1 : unsink it
1 : pretty much
2 : unsink it
3 : yeah
2 : i could unsink you
1 : well, well
1 : why don't we undo that?
1 : if we put this back here then you can unsink it.
2 : oh
1 : 
3 : and then move
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : so that's one turn, and then you still have two more
2 : ok
1 : what's your special thing?
2 : i can give a treasure card to a player
2 : anywhere on the island for one action.
3 : she has a red card. you could give her your red one.
2 : yeah but we need four right?
3 : yeah
1 : and then i would have to that would hurt me on my next turn.
3 : oh
1 : cause i'll have to pick two and then i'll have to lose one of those
2 : yeah
3 : never mind, don't do that.
1 : so we don't want that.
2 : so i'll just uh
1 : if you wanna move anywhere else
2 : move one, yeah
2 : we'll go to misty marsh.
1 : if you use your next two down to here you can save lost lagoon.
2 : oh, ok
1 : so if we do like
1 : here,
2 : mmhmm
1 : for one move, and then here for the next one.
2 : yeah, good idea.
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : or wait that would be three,
1 : never mind.
2 : so i'd have to stay there
1 : cause that'd be one you'd have to stay here yeah
3 : yeah
2 : ok that's fine.
1 : ok
2 : i'll stay there
2 : then i take two here
1 : and then
1 : mmhmm
2 : i get to shore up any one island, play at anytime, does not count as an action.
2 : so i could shore up the lost lagoon
1 : maybe save that for a little bit, i guess
2 : save it?
3 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : good idea.
1 : and then so pick two of those.
2 : ok and then take two of these.
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : breaker's bridge
2 : and golden gate.
1 : so we lost golden gate.
2 : oh because it's already flooded.
1 : oh jeez
3 : yeah
2 : golden gate
2 : and breaker's bridge
1 : what's, what's on the
2 : you're on breaker's bridge
1 : alright
2 : or i'm on breaker's bridge
2 : so it floods.
1 : what character is that?
2 : that's
3 : this?
3 : it's
3 : like a yellow pawn.
2 : that would be the umm wind
2 : statue of wind
1 : i don't know what that is.
3 : mm
3 : nah, that's that one.
3 : i don't know what this is
2 : oh
1 : we'll deal with that later i guess
3 : ok, sounds good
2 : mk
3 : oh wait where does this go?
3 : over there
2 : oh it goes here
3 : ok
3 : umm
1 : your turn
3 : should i try to undo these things?
1 : this
1 : uh yeah if you want
3 : ok
3 : i'll move here for one
3 : umm
3 : and do unflood this for two
3 : and
3 : yeah. i think that's good unless you have other suggestions
3 : no? ok
1 : no go ahead and take two.
3 : a helicopter lift
3 : and the chalice
3 : and then
1 : still two of those
3 : cliffs of abandon and lost lagoon, so we lose lost lagoon.
1 : alright so
1 : that's ironic.
1 : in the
1 : umm
3 : and the cliffs of abandon
1 : mm
2 : mm
1 : here it is
2 : there it is
3 : him
3 : thank you
1 : mmhmm
1 : my turn
1 : i'm the red guy
1 : i should probably save cliffs of abandon.
1 : and then
1 : i'm gonna need a blue thing at some point,
1 : there's one down there.
3 : a blue thing?
1 : the water chalice thingy
3 : oh
1 : so i'm just gonna move
1 : cause i have two and you have one so at some point you can
3 : yeah, so we just need one more.
1 : i'm just gonna move
1 : 
1 : i guess i'll just stay here.
2 : mm
1 : i'll just move to cities of abandon i guess
3 : ok
1 : i only have one more.
1 : uh
1 : and i guess i can hang out with
1 : the pilot
1 : alright
2 : ok
1 : two of these
1 : cool
3 : oh awesome.
1 : so yeah, at some point you should
3 : alright yeah i'll give you yours on my turn.
1 : alright, cool
2 : ok now
2 : this guy's
1 : alright so we're nice and unflooded for the time being.
2 : mmhmm hmm
1 : iron gate
2 : mm
3 : that's this one
1 : yeah
1 : and whispering garden
2 : oh bummer
3 : it's up here
1 : alright
2 : ok fine
2 : alright so do they both go in here because the other one was
1 : mm
2 : already flooded? is that what happens?
1 : no, they're both, they're both good.
1 : iron cause i had iron gate
2 : ok yeah
1 : they're both good
2 : ok
1 : alright
2 : alright
1 : your turn
2 : ok i'm going to make my way down to how how
2 : umm howling gardens
2 : so
1 : are you
1 : ok there you are
2 : i'll go here
2 : and umm
2 : ooo
2 : umm
2 : i get three moves
2 : shore up, why would i shore up?
1 : there's nothing for you to shore up
3 : yeah there's no flooded places around you.
1 : in close by.
2 : oh ok
2 : give a treasure card or capture a treasure. hmm i'm not ready to capture yet, i don't think.
1 : no
2 : so i get two more moves?
1 : if you want them, yeah
2 : yeah, ok then i'll go to there
2 : and then here.
2 : alright
2 : and then i'll take two of these
1 : mmhmm
1 : oh jeez
2 : bummer
1 : water's
1 : so we shuffle this
2 : mmhmm
3 : and move the
2 : so we move it up once
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
1 : wait do we move it up before or after?
2 : it should've been before but that's i guess
1 : oh that's trivial but
1 : otherwise 
2 : so we've shuffled and now i discard this to the treasure
2 : discard pile.
1 : and then now you're gonna have to take three
2 : take three
1 : of these.
3 : yeah
2 : oh jeez
2 : that means we sink three
2 : places?
1 : potentially.
3 : yeah, we flood them, at least.
2 : oh no
1 : not necessarily sink
2 : temple moon
2 : breaker's bridge
2 : ah
2 : oh whispering gardens. it's gone.

3 : purple so, doesn't matter.
1 : well yeah we
1 : all three have purple so i'm just gonna discard this one.
3 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : umm

3 : this one cause it's special.
3 : so i'm gonna use my
3 : pilot abilities and fly here.
3 : as
3 : two and then
3 : unflood it.
1 : cool

3 : ok
3 : these go in here
1 : yeah no, the
3 : oh
1 : or wait no there, probably.
2 : ok hold on you've captured the guys
3 : i think they would
3 : wait discard cards into treasure
2 : if you discard
3 : yeah they go over here.
2 : capture treasures, you discard four matching treasue cards while on the
1 : ok
2 : corresponding tile
2 : discard treasure.
1 : alright

3 : ok
2 : ok

2 : mm
1 : alright
2 : ss
2 : ok

1 : well if you wanna do like one, two and then save that
2 : oh ok
3 : yeah
3 : cause that one's important.
1 : or wait

2 : yeah
1 : if we wanna
1 : get those.
3 : oh yeah you could give her your cards now and i'll give mine the next time and then when we get to you, you could
1 : yeah ok
1 : cause you can i think
3 : wait are you near a yellow thing though?
1 : where i'm red
3 : yeah you're red right?
3 : so you can just move there and then use your cards.
1 : yeah
1 : well ok so she has the ability to give me more than one
3 : yeah i think so
1 : is that what it is?
2 : no i could give you one card.
1 : her spec
2 : uh give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card.
1 : oh ok so you can just give it to anyone.
2 : oh one action per card.
1 : so if you wanna give me two
3 : yeah and that can be two of your actions
2 : i could do that now?
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : and then you have a third action, you can move or you can just stay where you are, it's up to you.
2 : ok i could stay where i am
2 : and then i will take my two
1 : ok
2 : ugh, chalice
2 : this doesn't matter right, cause we're done
1 : nah
3 : yeah it's fine.
1 : but you got a water's rise 
2 : water's rise so i move it up one
1 : mmhmm
2 : and then shuffle the flood
1 : yup
2 : discard pile
1 : to these
2 : and then discard this to the treasure discard pile.
2 : and then put it on top?
1 : mmhmm
3 : mm
2 : why not the bottom?
2 : just asking
2 : ok
1 : so now you're gonna have to take three
2 : ah
2 : no
2 : one, two, three
1 : if we lose tidal palace it won't be a big deal but
2 : temple of the sun,
1 : ah
3 : aw man
3 : ok
1 : 
2 : temple of the sun twice
1 : one's temple of the moon
2 : oh temple of the moon
1 : that's not good either
3 : can i have the temple of the sun card?
2 : ok temple of the sun
1 : and breaker's bridge is gone.
2 : and breaker's bridge is gone.
1 : it's, it's toast.
3 : ok
1 : don't panic
1 : uh
1 : so yeah just leave that there.
3 : ok so
3 : i wanna give you this card as one action
1 : alright
1 : and then i'm gonna
3 : i'm gonna save
3 : this
1 : ok
3 : as one
1 : i need to get rid of one of these
3 : and i can save this one too right?
3 : cause i'm next to it.
1 : yeah
3 : ok i'll save that as three.
1 : i, i have to get rid of one. should i get rid of the uh purple thing or the red thing?
3 : the red thing because we have two purple things
1 : alright
2 : well
1 : oh yeah but she has
2 : we have
1 : but there's two other ones i think
2 : oh i see
3 : yeah
1 : we'll do that
2 : ok

3 : uh another helicopter lift
3 : and then a purple one.

3 : oh
3 : one, two, three, four, five, six. ok so
2 : mm
1 : well could you use one of them now?
2 : sandbag
1 : cause what some of them don't count as turns.
3 : oh yeah i can use helicopters at anytime.
1 : so just yeah it wouldn't count as a turn, just use it.
3 : both of them? these two?
1 : just use one
3 : well i have three
3 : and i have to get rid of two

2 : oh
1 : well there's five of them actually in play.
3 : oh
1 : cool
2 : oh
3 : ok
3 : cause we need to do that
3 : but i also should save
1 : save one
3 : we can't
3 : can we save this one anymore?
3 : cause there's nothing around it
1 : yeah it's pointless, don't save it.
3 : so
1 : i mean you could because you can fly anywhere but
3 : move
1 : don't do it.
3 : yeah we can't get there anyway.
1 : keep the cave of shadows.
3 : ok so move and then
1 : mmhmm
3 : one,
3 : two,
3 : and then
1 : wait, wait, wait, wait
1 : can we undo that?
1 : go here
1 : come
1 : instead of going down here, come over here and then we can save these two.
3 : and then not give any of my cards?
1 : i guess you can still save this one but you still have more access to this one than you did before.
3 : ok, that's fine.
1 : just out of safety.
3 : ok
1 : and then
1 :  i don't
1 : well
1 : we can just give you the card
1 : cause you're gonna be right by here anyway.
3 : ok so should i use my last one to
2 : uh
2 : i didn't think that yeah
1 : shore that up yeah
3 : yeah ok
3 : ok
2 : ok great
3 : chalice and a
3 : fire
3 : umm
1 : get rid of the chalice
1 : and then i have two of the fire and then she has one and you
3 : wait i still have to get rid of one
3 : cause i have six.
1 : oh ok
3 : umm
3 : or i can use one.
1 : if you wanna just move over to here and then
3 : yeah ok i'll helicopter lift over here
1 : aight cool
1 : what does sandbag do?
1 : what does it say?
3 : you can shore up any tile on the island and you can play it at anytime.
2 : ooh
2 : then we should shore up some uh
1 : we don't anything shored up right now, i don't think.
3 : yeah we should save that for like fool's landing
1 : in case fool's landing yeah
3 : yeah
2 : oh ok
3 : ok
1 : aight cool, my turn?
2 : yup
3 : yes
3 : oh wait i didn't pick a
2 : oh yeah
3 : these
3 : umm watchtower,
3 : misty marsh,
3 : and howling garden.
2 : shoo
3 : and watchtower, we didn't do that one.
1 : oh i just realized we have to be on the same tower to transfer cards.
3 : thanks
1 : or the same
1 : tile to transfer cards.
2 : mm
3 : did we not do that?
1 : we might have messed that up a little.
2 : ok
1 : for future reference.
2 : well we might have a time now, or a chance.
1 : alright
3 : ok, sorry
1 : well alright, we don't wanna
1 : it's ok
1 : am i red?
1 : yeah, so
1 : i wanna
1 : get to you
2 : that would be your three moves.
1 : yeah
1 : that would be bad.
3 : umm
2 : well can't you fly oh no, it's not your turn.
3 : wait
3 : oh
3 : am i not allowed to use this if it's not my turn?
3 : it says play at anytime.
2 : oh then there you go.
3 : i can helicopter lift you there.
2 : yeah that's a good idea
1 : alright
1 : alright
3 : ok
1 : wait
3 : should we check to make sure that's real?
1 : yeah let's make sure that's
3 : helicopter lift
3 : that's required to leaves fool's island
1 : yeah but oh do you not have anymore?
3 : that's my last one.
1 : oh jeez
3 : i mean we could get another one eventually but
3 : we might not.
1 : is it
2 : i think you should take the risk
1 : i think she can transfer them regardless and she has two of them.
1 : so let's just wait.
1 : cause she i don't think she has to be
1 : as the uh
1 : she's the messenger
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
1 : so the messenger doesn't have to be on the same tile to give cards so i'm just not gonna give cards and then she can give the two
1 : and then you can get it.
3 : oh yeah, ok that's fine.
1 : so let's just
2 : ok yeah, good idea.
1 : i would shore these two or we don't need that one really
1 : but
1 : i'll just shore this one up.
3 : ok
1 : i guess, just so we have an extra sport
1 : and then i'll just
1 : move over here just so we have the red on the red. cause i have two and then there's two other ones out there.
3 : ok
2 : ok do you take these?
1 : yeah
1 : i need three of them.
3 : did you take treasure cards?
1 : no
1 : can i have two?
1 : thank you
1 : oh jeez why don't we 
1 : pause on that.
1 : i got a helicopter lift.
1 : that's convenient now.
2 : mm
1 : and water's rise
1 : oh jeez, alright
1 : so now i'm gonna need three.
1 : shuffle these first actually.
1 : bronze gate,
1 : is toast.
1 : cave of shadows which is what i'm on.
1 : we're gonna need that saved at some point.
3 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : cliffs of abandon.
1 : uh here it is.
