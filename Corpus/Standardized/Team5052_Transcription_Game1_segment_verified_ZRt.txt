1 : ok
4 : alright
1 : so, our strategy, i think, should be
1 : make sure this is
1 : never flooded. like that shh
4 : right
1 : especially for you, if you can fly there and get there.
3 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
1 : umm
1 : and also, whoever has
1 : lke, see how i have two? if you have one, that should be one of your actions would be like to get the person with the most
1 : then, once we have
1 : like, one of the treasures
1 : i don't think we need to care about
2 : yeah, cause i was gonna say you should move there first to
4 : unsink it
2 : flip it over.
1 : yeah
2 : shore it up.
1 : ok
4 : and then shore up
2 : mmhmm
4 : and you can do two, right?
1 : i'll do these
1 : so that's
1 : two
1 : my second action
2 : right, that counts as one
3 : mmhmm
1 : and
1 : and
1 : i'll just start moving closer to this one so i can get the chalice
1 : ok
1 : so two
1 : now take up to three, that wasn't
2 : alright, go back.
1 : oh
2 : cause you moved, flipped it up, that's two. yeah
1 : i guess i moved there, then i shored it up
3 : mmhmm
1 : got it.
1 : right.
1 : ok
4 : put that up one
1 : move the water level
1 : shuffle
1 : oh
4 : you have to shuffle all these and put em on top
1 : there's already ones in there?
2 : and discard that
2 : first
2 : and then draw two
1 : ok
2 : lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon
2 : and we already lost a tile
4 : at least
1 : that's that's a that's a meaningless tiles anyways
2 : so that gets discarded and lost lagoon also gets
3 : hmm, hmm, mmhmm
4 : and discard that
1 : ok
4 : and then
2 : now it's my turn?
1 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
2 : umm
2 : i will
2 : move here
2 :  i can move again, i guess, and then flip it.
4 : is that like one
4 : you have you can move two places
4 : or just
2 : i guess that's two moves
3 : mm
4 : oh, ok.
2 : will that be my three?
2 : sandbags
2 : and
4 : should we use the sandbags right away?
1 : i think we should keep em
2 : yeah, cause we're good right now
2 : draw two flood cards
3 : 
4 : only if you get a water rise
2 : do i
2 : good
2 : phantom rock and breaker's bridge
1 : no
3 : so this is goin, right?
4 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, what was that? that's
1 : phantom's rock
3 : phantom rock, doesn't mean anything anyway
2 : and breaker's bridge
1 : nnhmm
3 : alright
4 : umm
3 : where should i fly?
1 : umm
2 : gold gate?
1 : yeah
1 : i'd pick that one.
3 : why?
2 : i don't know
1 : just cause it's
4 : why not fly there? because if we get a waters tise card i mean it's not an important tile but
4 : if we keep losing all the tiles
3 : yeah, that m
2 : yeah
3 : we lose this, it doesn't mean anything
4 : and like we have
2 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : yeah
3 : so fly here?
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : shore that up
4 : mmhmm
3 : then i have i have one more
1 : oh
4 : uh, it doesn't make sense to give anyone
1 : no
3 : mm i'll just keep it
1 : nnhmm
3 : if i can only do two actions, right?
3 : mm
2 : yeah, unless you want to move again. that's be another ac
1 : mmhmm
4 : you just can't fly again. you can just move a space
3 : hmm i think i'll stay there
3 : i'm shh and i'm gonna save this. should i keep this, just in case? ok, so
1 : mmhmm
2 : mm
4 : mmhmm
1 : probably need it
4 : you pick
3 : i draw two of these
3 : alright, well now i have two
3 : then
3 : draw two of those
4 : mmhmm
3 : golden gate
1 : mm
3 : umm
3 : temple of the moon
3 : flip that one back.
3 : this one
4 : ok
4 : so
4 : i can
2 : you can go diagonal and then give me your lion card
4 : mmhmm
1 : oh that's a good idea
4 : oh good call
1 : you can only give it somebody you're on the tile with
1 : ok
4 : uh, that's yours, right? ok
2 : yeah
3 : hmm, that's two
4 : and then
3 : you could shh shore up that one
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : oh
4 : this one?
2 : yeah, cause you're next to it
1 : nice
4 : alright. that was three right?
2 : mmhmm
3 : mm
3 : mm
4 : and can i have two flood cards?
4 : whispering garden and iron gate
4 : garden
1 : ok
1 : hmm
1 : any ideas?
4 : move one and shore
4 : oh wait, that's not
1 : are only allowed to give one treasure card?
1 : like
1 : if i went here, could i just give both of these to you no, i guess that would be a waste of time
2 : no, i guess
2 : yeah, you would only give one card per
1 : yeah
1 : mm
1 : can i
2 : 
3 : i would move one, two, and shore that up. cause next is adjacent to you. that way you're still close to them if you need to be
1 : eh
1 : ok
2 : but can't messenger explorer only
3 : be your one, two
4 : moves
3 : that's one move, that's two moves, that third action would be to shh shore the
2 : but can't the messenger only i mean. explorer only
2 : shore it up if they're next to it?
1 : can move or shore up diagonally
1 : we can all do adjacent.
4 : can't we all shore
2 : oh, oh. ok, ok, ok.
3 : well she if it's adjacent, yeah
4 : are you going to shore that up?
1 : so
1 : yeah
1 : alright
2 : good
1 : two
1 : oh my ga
1 : k
1 : so try to keep in mind whichever ones were recently flooded, i guess.
4 : mmhmm
3 : well we unflooded iron gate. it doesn't mean anything
1 : ok
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : iron gate
1 : whispering garden. oh my goodness
1 : alright, so we wanna make sure i think these ones are the most important.
1 : no matter what
1 : eh
2 : but there's another one
1 : yeah
3 : hmm
4 : ok
1 : is that everything i have to do?
3 : mm i think i think we're good
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : so, i guess the first thing i'll do
2 : is shore up
2 : cliffs of abandon
2 : and then
4 : mean you can move one and shore up that but
2 : yeah
1 : k
4 : you're gonna have to discard something
2 : oh, you're you're right. one, two, three
2 : four, five
2 : well, i'll discard a sandbags
2 : right? should i do that?
3 : mm do you have to use it?
4 : can you use it?
3 : do you have to use it?
1 : can you use both sandbags?
4 : we don't even have anything flipped over to use it on
1 : can can they just rest on there?
3 : perhaps we could or do you have to use it to discard it?
4 : no, like if she has five she c
2 : i don't think so. cause it's kinda like i have to discard one of them
4 : well i think you s even if you discard that you still have six
4 : don't you have four of those?
2 : four, five six
1 : wait, do you have four of these?
2 : yeah
1 : why didn't we get him?
4 : cause she just picked it
3 : 
1 : oh, you just picked it
4 : but, i would just discard
4 : one of the sandbags and either the other sandbag or the
3 : mm uh, i would get rid of the fire thing
1 : yeah, i think the fire thing is the
2 : ok
3 : do you want me to just get rid of it?
2 : yeah
1 : so sad
4 : well she can hopefully move there next time
2 : one, two, three
3 : ok,  i can do flood cards
1 : 
4 : flood cards
1 : you need three now
2 : breaker's bridge, temple of the moon
2 : and temple of the sun.
1 : breaker's bridge, where is it?
4 : i don't 
4 : just kidding
1 : ok
4 : alright
4 : so
2 : pilot, you're up
4 : i think that you
1 : think you co
1 : giver her one of those?
4 : i think he should give you this one
1 : oh, yeah. cause then i'll definitely
4 : but, is he near you
1 : can you fly me?
1 : cause then
1 : if you, mm, yeah
3 : right, i have two of these helicopter lift things
1 : so, maybe if you give me the chalice
4 : does he have to be on the same
2 : yeah, only i can give a card if i'm not
1 : you're right
4 : what
1 : mm
2 : i think you should
3 :  i could i could fly here
3 : give her the chalice
1 : and then fly me over there?
4 : but that doesn't count as a move so maybe you should
4 : flip this, temple of the moon
2 : i think you need to flip that one cause both of those are
3 : mm
1 : good call
2 : flipped over
3 : so, flip this
4 : so, shore up that one
4 : give fly er, yeah. fly yourself to where she is
3 : fly myself here
3 : that's two
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
4 : and give her a card, which is three. and the helicopter lift card doesn't count as a move so you can still fly whoever's on here
3 : right, i can use this at anytime, correct? i can use it, like, during your turn
1 : mmhmm. so, i guess it can wait
3 : yeah, just just in case
1 : it's not, yeah
2 : mmhmm
2 : mmhmm
1 : in case something gets flooded
4 : ok
3 : so, wait
3 : are you -- i'm i'm good then?
1 : yeah, you just need the
2 : yeah, and then just three of these
3 : but i didn't i didn't
3 : three actions, right? yeah, ok.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
4 : yeah, you have to pick two of those first
3 : 
1 : yeah
2 : oh
2 : ok
2 : that's that
3 : we can start we can start discarding these, too, once we get cause we have four
1 : mm k
4 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, that's a good call
3 : ok, so can can you hand me three water cards?
1 : oh, and she already does have this
2 : yeah
3 : umm
1 : so you could fly her at anytime there
1 : fly me at anytime there, just to get it
3 : mmhmm
4 : oh, yeah
3 : do but don't we need one of these to leave the game? so i should keep one, just in case, if we don't get another one
1 : yeah
2 : well yeah, my next move i'll be moving over there anyway so
3 : yeah
1 : so, i guess, yeah
3 : so i
4 : so it's a good idea not to move the whole
3 : 
3 : hmm
3 : cause
4 : crimson forest
3 : hmm
4 : copper gate
2 : and what was it? tidal
3 : it's gonna 
4 : alright
3 : shh
1 : now fly me to it
2 : mmhmm
3 : that doesn't sink
4 : i will
3 : most 
2 : and there's this one
1 : 
1 : oh, yeah you need to come 
4 : i need to come on with you, one
1 : so you can give her that
4 : two
4 : if i move over here i can still shore that one up
2 : mmhmm
3 :  you already you already moved one
1 : oh
4 : no
1 : one, two
4 : oh, should i shore this one up?
3 : two
3 : i would move there and shore it up
1 : mm
4 : move there?
3 : wait, no cause does that count as a
4 : oh, yeah, it will count
1 : wait, can't you just shore it up?
3 : 
3 : yeah, just shore it up then
3 : well cause you'd be closer for next turn but i would just do that
4 : oh
4 : oh crap
3 : at least we're still at three
4 : ok, can you shuffle the
2 : oh, yeah
3 : give me that card
1 : yeah, at least we are still at three
1 : but
1 : this could
4 : kill our
4 : i don't know
1 : our plan. well, he can always deliver me there
4 : deliver you
1 : and then we don't have to worry about it
3 : mmhmm
4 : temple of the sun, copper gate, whispering garden
1 : temple of the moon
2 : temple of the
4 : temple of the sun
2 : temple of the sun's gone
3 : so you hand me that
4 : i flipped and then copper gate, the one
1 : wh which one is it?
2 : it was a chalice one no earth one
3 : mm er er mm, earth
4 : but now
4 : you can m
1 : ok, so
4 : you can just move there, though
4 : don't you
1 : i can't like, go there that fast
4 : oh, you can't move diagonally
1 : yeah. do you want to fly me now?
3 : mm wait
4 : can you use that, like, in the middle of your turn?
3 : uh can you give me the time?
3 :  play at anytime
1 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : no
1 : uh
2 : no?
2 : guess not
1 : may only have five cards
1 : oh, that's me!
4 : that is you
4 : umm
3 : discard
3 : ooo
4 : the
4 : fire
2 : the fire
3 : yeah
4 : but now
1 : 
4 : can you fly
1 : i think you still should fly me there.
4 : does that work?
3 : i'm trying to think if we get we get three actions, right?
1 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : so if you
4 : but she can't move diagonally
3 : then, uh, so
1 : does that count as my action?
3 : yeah, you're collecting the treasure so i i have to fly you. i'm trying to think of another way you could do it but you you can't.
1 : oh, yeah, no
1 : i think i should be flown
3 : ok, so i'll fly you there
3 : we'll discard this
4 : do you just fly?
3 : move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile
4 : one person
1 : so does anybody else want to come with me?
2 : no, gotta i gotta stay by whispering garden
1 : yeah, you have to stay there.
4 : that does
1 : but
1 : alright, any of you close? you're kinda close to that
1 : 
3 : we have a lot of tiles. we should all stay close cause these are all  part
1 : yeah
1 : alright
2 : should you
4 : just fly
2 : umm
2 : flood up
2 : whispering garden in case you pull
1 : like both of them first
1 : and then fly there?
2 : yeah, in case you pull a
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : ok, cause i can do two.
2 : water rising
2 : yeah
4 : that counts as one turn?
3 : 
2 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, one action
3 :  two actions
3 : this doesn't count so you're  here
1 : s
1 : wait that was
3 : when
1 : this si just one action
4 : for her, she can do two
3 : oh, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
1 : yeah
1 : so, now i'm here
2 : and then when you collect that
2 : that's an action.
4 : right
1 : oh it is? ok, so
2 : mm
1 : one action
1 : did that count as an action? ok
3 : no
2 : no, but when you collect this chalice
2 : it'll be that's an action
1 : now what do i do with the cards?
3 : 
4 : discar
4 : i think you
3 :  just discard the
1 : 
1 : just
3 :  you
4 : and now we just have
3 : you have one left
1 : 
1 : yay, ok
3 : why don't you just flip that?
4 : yeah
1 : it's pretty good
3 : mmhmm
4 : that was good
1 : we got one
4 : alright
4 : now you can pick
1 : two
1 : woohoo! look at that
1 : k
4 : three
1 : ok, crimson forest
3 : 
1 : was that a
3 : 
1 : special one?
3 : no
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : that's a central tile
1 : temple of the moon
1 : oh
1 : ok
3 : yeah, we gotta keep that one
2 : that one's our last one
2 : of the earth, so
1 : oh no
2 : that's important
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : so
2 : so i'm gonna
2 : move, collect. that's two
1 : and then
3 : mm i
1 : i can f
2 : or, no. should i flip
3 : uh
2 : should i flood this up
2 : first and then move, collect?
3 : if you can do all three
1 : well, i could fly her
2 : should i do that?
3 : you shh y y y you need keep you need to keep this one.
4 : right, so if she moves there
1 : so if you move
4 : flip
4 : a f uh
3 : 
3 : move he move here, collect
4 : shored up that one
3 : fly her there and then shore up
3 : that would be three.
1 : yeah
2 : do that?
4 : k
3 : so
3 : move there
1 : hmm
4 : collect
3 : collect
1 : nice
3 : that's two
3 : then fly can you use your
2 : and then fly me
4 : fly her
1 : ok
3 : there
4 : to the temple of moon
3 : shore that up
4 : shore it up
4 : that's three.
1 : ok
2 : and then right
3 : mm
2 : fires
1 : good
3 : that's good, yeah
4 : cause now we keep getting rid of those
2 : and three of these
2 : silver gate
2 : tidal palace
2 : and breaker's bridge
1 : i need to get off of that guy
3 : breaker's  this is the
2 : breaker's bridge
4 : ok
1 : ok
1 : so
4 : i think you should give
4 : me or her
4 : the engineer, this card
1 : who's closest to that
1 : piece? you are.
4 : me
1 : so
1 : and she could just, in one move
2 : mmhmm
1 : just go bam.
1 : so i think you should give her one of the
4 : but i only have two
3 : we have to wait a whole t til it comes around again cause you only have
3 : three of them, she needs four.
4 : yeah
1 : oh, you're right
3 : so it would make sense trying to get we should try to get you us to try to get you closest to that
4 : one of them
2 : mmhmm
1 : does anybody have a flight card, though?
3 : i do, but i don't know if we're gon gonna get one again
4 : umm
1 : umm
2 : well
1 : i mean we could risk
2 : mm
2 : no, i wouldn't risk it
3 : we have fifteen minutes
1 : oh my gosh
1 : ok
4 : let's
2 : pilot, it's your turn right now.
3 : mmhmm
1 : do you how close are you to her
1 : right now?
3 : 
3 : close
1 : cause like
1 : she also has two
3 : mm, ok.
4 : oh, true.
1 : umm, i think you could do that
4 : so if you move, move
4 : or, i mean you can fly yourself there.
1 : yeah
1 : i would fly yourself.
1 : cause my place doesn't matter
1 : 
3 : i can fly myself here
1 : mmhmm
1 : unshore both of those
3 : shore this one shore this one up and give her the fire thing
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : so  hopefully she can get another time it gets to her
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : so, one
3 : two
3 : three.
2 : good
4 : unflood
3 : the dunes
3 : bronze gate and
3 : cave of shadows
3 : where's the cave of shadows?
3 : right here
3 : uh oh
1 : oh
1 : ok
1 : so, that's an important one
4 : alright
4 : i
1 : ok
2 : i also have sandbags, too.
1 : ok
4 : when can you use that?
1 : whenever
2 : anytime
1 : umm
1 : but when we pick a flood card, it has to be used imediately. so i don't think you can use a sandbag
1 : so
1 : is there anymore so we still have this one left so i don't think we should use it unless
2 : yeah
3 : mm ok
4 : well, i can do
1 : hmm?
4 : if i move here
4 : not that it
4 : helps that much
4 : but i can give him
3 : i would give her i would give her those two cards
1 : oh
4 : i don't think i can give both of them
3 : it would count as
2 : two actions
3 : two actions
4 : oh
1 : wait
1 : no, you should move here and give him your two cards
4 : but, she's over here
4 : yeah
3 : wait, why?
3 : cause then you can you can
4 : because
2 : because you're
1 : because i'm not close.
3 : you one, two
3 : that would be a third move, ok.
1 : yeah
1 : and
1 : it's her turn
3 : yeah, ok, that makes sense
4 : so if i move
4 : one
2 : there
1 : mmhmm
4 : two
1 : mm give  the pilot
3 : 
4 : three?
2 : pilot, pilot.
4 : oh
3 : ok
1 : cause then
4 : three
3 : i have to discard two cards now, right?
2 : yeah, and that's fine
4 : yeah, we don't need those
4 : so i need two cards
4 : so we just have to make sure
1 : oh
1 : k
4 : that gets
4 : flooded whoever can
1 : mmhmm
1 : and
1 : need these two
4 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : mm three
4 : i would need another one
1 : oh, ok
4 : cave of embers, misty marsh
4 : hollowing
4 : howling garden
1 : ok
3 : mm we don't have to worry about that or that one.
1 : so, i don't know if you want to use one of your sandbags now
2 : yeah, this is fine
4 : and save what?
1 : or, i guess
1 : ok
3 : oh, yeah, you
2 : and save this one?
1 : ok, well i can
1 : so
1 : it's my turn now
1 : umm
4 : you can just save that one
1 : i'll save this one so it's not as important
3 : what don't you have to do two for one? is that your thing?
1 : i can do two for one but they have to be next to each
3 : you can just flip these two
4 : both of
1 : can i?
3 : yeah, if we counted it
1 : up to two tiles
3 : so if it does it
3 : it's
2 : this doesn't cont as an action
2 : so it's
3 : yah
2 : it can be played at anytime. so yeah, you could do that
3 : but she can do she can do
4 : but she can do it with her power
3 : two for the price of one
2 : but, wouldn't you have to be next to it?
3 : mm
4 : she does
3 : she is next to yeah she's next to just those two
1 : i don't know if that means this ok
2 : oh, you're red. yeah, yeah
3 : 
2 : yeah
2 : sorry
3 : so so that would count as one action, flipping those two
4 : so that's one action
4 : and then
1 : 
3 : ok
1 : umm
1 : ok
1 : and then
4 : i guess just 
4 : move to fool's landing maybe, in case we get
3 : yeah  just in case we're there
4 : k so two
2 : well that's diagonal
4 : but she can one, two
3 : one, two, alright
1 : k
3 : yeah
4 : well she already did
