3 : alright
2 : k
2 : let's go.
3 : take it away engineer
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : first i can take up to three actions.
1 : umm does anybody have any suggestions?
1 : i was thinking of like
1 : maybe moving and then
1 : shoring up two tiles
2 : ok
3 : that sounds good
1 : that works, ok
2 : that sounds fine with me.
3 : yeah
1 : so this is one action
2 : mmhmm
3 : what other cards do you have?
3 : ok
1 : umm
1 : i'll shore up
1 : this one
1 : and
1 : this one, i guess
3 : sounds good
1 : so that's my second action
2 : ok
1 : and then for my third action
1 : umm
1 : i guess i can move again
3 : yeah
1 : or
2 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : i'll move
1 : here.
2 : ok
1 : and then
1 : draw two treasure deck cards
1 : so i got these. water's rise, so i guess i have to play that now.
3 : ooo
2 : oh no
1 : umm move this up one.
2 : ok
1 : shuffle the flood discard pile. we don't
1 : are these
2 : yeah
1 : ok

1 : i took three
3 : she moved twice and shored one up.
2 : yeah
1 : but that's my power
1 : ok
1 : umm so shuffling the flood discard pile.

3 : umm
3 : we have three of these earth
3 : cards on the board.
3 : so i could
2 : ok

3 : well
3 : we have four lions
1 : you can get rid of the sandbags
3 : on the table right now.

2 : i mean you could what
3 : well should i get rid of the sandbags if we have this many flooded tiles
3 : at the moment?
2 : i would
2 : yeah i wouldn't do that
1 : maybe you should keep that
3 : i can get rid of one helicopter lift
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : and then i'll take an earth card
2 : alright
2 : so then i'll give you the earth card

3 : just looking at the board
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : so all four treasures are in this area
2 : mmhmm
3 : as is fool's landing so we could just focus all of our efforts right in here
2 : mmhmm
1 : but then if one of these gets sunk then we're screwed.
3 : true
3 : but it's such a tight area that we'd be so mobile
1 : yeah we could like focus on here but then like if one of them one of these get sunk it's no big deal.
2 : mmhmm

2 : alright
1 : wow we already got two
3 : yeah
3 : i'm in line to get three
3 : umm

3 : i kinda wanna save it just because we're so close
1 : yeah
1 : umm
1 : i mean i can get there on my own because
1 : umm i'm here so in my next turn i can do one, two,
1 : three, and then on
1 : like wait
1 : unless this gets flooded
2 : i think, i think what you should do is like one, two, and then shore that up
1 : shore it yeah ok, we'll do that. so i think you can just
2 : yeah
1 : like, you don't have to do anything else.
3 : ok
2 : but
2 : she does have to take
2 : oh she could ok alright yeah.
1 : you don't have to
3 : ok
3 : umm

3 : oh the howling garden
2 : ok 
3 : it's no big deal
3 : the cave of embers
3 : and the bronze gate
2 : there
3 : ok
3 : so that wasn't so bad
2 : ok
1 : ok now it's my turn
1 : so i'm gonna

2 : i really don't hope it's aw
1 : oh but i have to discard something
1 : well
3 : not yet
1 : not yet
1 : i'll have to discard
1 : the helicopter, or
1 : i'll keep the helicopter and discard this.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : and then water's rise
1 : though, we're still at three which is ok.
1 : umm shuffle
1 : this,
1 : place it here,
1 : and then this goes there.
1 : so one, two,

3 : as is the whispering garden
1 : cities of abandon is
1 : this oh right yeah ok
3 : oh that's still there
2 : ok
2 : alright
2 : cool.
2 : so in terms of move recommendations for me
2 : umm
2 : should i just shore up the surrounding area?
3 : what you could do would be to shore up those two and then get yourself to fool's landing.
2 : ok, i think that's a really good call.
2 : alright
1 : yeah
2 : so
2 : one,
2 : two,
2 : alright.
2 : and then i'm gonna draw two treasure cards
2 : so earth
2 : and this, and then i gotta discard
2 : do you guys have any recommendations for what i should discard?
1 : you could discard this cause we already have one.
2 : ok
2 : oh, one and then one more.
1 : the fi
3 : the earth cards
2 : the, the
2 : this one.
1 : yeah
1 : either that doesn't matter
2 : ok
2 : alright.
2 : so that's
2 : that, alright.
3 : mk.
2 : so one,
2 : two,
2 : three
2 : alright.

2 : is flooded,
2 : and then the bronze gate
1 : it's gone.
2 : alright
2 : k
3 : ok doke.
3 : umm so what has to happen this last round is you have to get here, do that, and then go there and then we'll be good.
1 : ok
3 : umm
3 : is there anything that i need to do other than get to fool's landing?
1 : so
1 : i don't think so.
2 : get to fool's landing and just shore up that, i guess
1 : you could fly here, shore this up, and then move here.
3 : either way cause i here one two
2 : yeah
3 : shore that up
1 : yeah
2 : k
3 : alright
3 : sandbags.
2 : ok
2 : cool
