3 : so intense
1 : right?
1 : so should i just shore up the two that are next to me?
2 :  
3 : that's a good idea
2 : ah
2 : i would say so
1 : ok
1 : 
2 : i think we should just try to shore up all of the ones closest to fool's landing
2 : two
3 : yeah and make sure that fool's landing doesn't get flooded because then we'll loose
1 : that's fair
2 : right.
2 : ok
3 : oh sunk
2 : umm
2 : so now
1 : so
1 : should i
2 : that was an action
1 : yeah so should i move up and shore those two as well?
2 : was that two actions?
1 : that was one action, cause i can move two
2 : oh right ok
1 : so engineer so if i
3 : you get three actions already
2 : so yeah move to whispering gardens
1 : so i can move one and then move the next two and then that would be all three
3 : shore up those adjacent yeah
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : can you shh, can you like shore up the
3 : one's diagonally? no because that's the
1 : no only the ones next to, yeah
2 : no that's the
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so yeah
3 : yeah
1 : so i should move? ok cool.
3 : and then
2 : ok
1 : alright and then
2 : hmm
2 : treasure deck
1 : yeah two
1 : yeah awesome
1 : so i have to do this right now right? ok.
2 : mm.
1 : 
1 : umm
1 : can uou put that over there for me please!
2 : yeah
1 : and then i have to draw two of these
2 : ah yeah
1 : that's whispering garden and breaker's bridge
1 : alright
2 :  
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : so
2 : move
2 : here
2 : and then
2 : shore up
2 : and then i'll shore up this up too
3 : ok
2 : and that's three
3 : mmhmm.
2 : one, two
1 : and then
2 : ok
2 : and then one, two
1 : yeah
2 : gold gate, cliffs of abandon
2 : oh
3 : oh
3 : ok so that's gone and then
2 : that's ok we don't need that.
2 : ah cliffs of abandon
1 : umm
2 : oh
3 : ok
2 : ok
3 : alright, so
3 : should i just
3 : shore up this one if i go this way and this way and then shore up
3 : that's three
2 : well you
3 : is there something else that
1 : you can
2 : you can shore up an adjacent tile so you only have to move to twilight hollow and coral palace
3 : oh ok
1 : you can also like fly and diagonally technically i guess right?
3 : yeah
2 : oh yeah ok ok.
3 : and we have two of those
3 : water  what are those called again? ah
1 : i don't know fire ones
2 : treasure card?
2 : fire, fire cards
3 : the fire ones, two of the purple ones.
3 : ok so we need
3 : to keep on trying to get treasure cards. alright, yeah so i'll
2 : yes
1 : so you're just gonna keep waiting basically
3 : yeah
3 : fly here
2 : shore it up
3 : shore it up
2 : so that's
2 : two
2 : action?
1 : i don't think
3 : hmm
1 : does he even have to do another action?
3 : i don't no i don't have to
2 : you don't, you don't have to
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : 
3 : ok so now i can do the two treasure cards
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : ok so we have another fire one
2 : ok
3 : and then helicopter lift
2 : umm and we need that to get off of fool's landing
1 : but we only need one so
2 : yeah i don't how many there are though
3 : yeah
3 : waht was two here?
2 : so
3 : umm
3 : cause i was thinking
3 : once we have
3 : two
3 : once
3 : right now you have two fires and i have one fire
1 : mmhmm.
3 : and i could fly to any tile you're on to give you
3 : a fire
1 : yeah
3 : so we just need
3 : you to get
3 : fires
2 : mmhmm.
3 : and then
3 : we can use
2 : i'll get these ones
3 : the helicopter lift
3 : to go to that tile
1 : or should i just start moving there?
3 : yeah
1 : like if i don't have any other actions to take, i can just move towards one
3 : that works too
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : we just don't want to
3 : have one of the treasure cards sink
2 : before we get it
3 : i mean it's ok we have one of the treasure cards sink but we can't have both of them yeah
1 : hmm
1 : both
3 : our treasure
3 : like these card yeah yeah yeah.
1 : yeah yeah i got it. tiles.
2 : yeah
3 : tiles
2 : ok so now you gotta do the flood
3 : the flood thing
1 : so two of those
2 : cards
2 : and two
2 : phantom rock and lost lagoon
3 : ok
2 : ooo phantom rock
3 : where are they?
1 : ah here's lost glu
2 : then this one's just
2 : done
2 : ok, you're turn.
3 : do we have to shuffle that or how do they? ok.
1 : no that's only if you
2 : no that's only when you
1 : you yeah yeah umm.
3 : only if you get the rise card. ok
3 : good
2 : water's rise
1 : should i just start
2 : yeah start moving to
1 : moving
3 : the
2 : cave of shadows or cave of embers
3 : yeah
1 : should i just go like i can reach there now with three moves, should i just go there?
3 : ah
3 : yeah we
1 : or should i do anything else
2 : well i don't think you need to umm
3 : what if you
2 : shore up anything because that's the only one, and if we yeah
1 : yeah cause if we lose that it doesn't really matter.
2 : so
3 : ok.
2 : i would say just move there. yeah
1 : ok
3 : if you take, cause how many actions is that? is that two or three?
2 : three
1 : that would be one, two, three but i don't, i don't have anything else to do i guess
3 : ok yeah .
2 : yeah go for it.
3 : yeah let's do that.
1 : and so i take two of those.
3 : ok there's a fire.
1 : right.
2 : umm but now you have five.
2 : so
1 : i can have up to five though right? ok cool and then take two of these?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : mmhmm.
1 : so
1 : temple of the moon 
1 : my bad
3 :  
2 : then iron gate
1 : umm yeah so we probably wanna try and shore up that one if we are not doing anything else
2 : ok ok.
2 : so my turn should i
2 : one, two, i'll shore that up i guess
2 : umm
1 : yeah and then the treasure card
2 : ok
1 : cause that was three wasn't it?
2 : oh water's rise
2 : ok umm
1 : at least you shored that one up.
2 : yeah true, true.
2 : oh
2 : and then oh oh we have to move this up
1 : yeah
2 : so three
2 : one
2 : two
2 : three, whispering garden, lost lagoon
1 : well this one's gone.
2 : and breaker's bridge. oh.
1 : oh sorry.
2 : you're fun.
2 : ah what was ok.
1 : and this one i think.
2 : so we should
2 : try to
3 : ok so whispering, yeah whierping garden
3 : sorta need that
3 : then
2 : umm
2 : so you can
2 : shore that up
3 : mmhmm.
3 : right now?
2 : yeah
1 : yeah it's your turn
3 : ok
2 : umm or you
1 : did you want to
2 : you could yeah you can shore that up and that'll be one and then you can move too, to cave of shadows with her.
1 : you could shore it up and then
1 : or you can just like fly
3 : i can fly to you
3 : and then give you the card
1 : and then give it and then that would be the third action
3 : ok
2 : ok, ok
1 : ok so do you want me to flip it for you.
3 : so yeah flip that
3 : and then i'll fly to
2 : cave of shadows
3 : the cave of shadows and i'll give you the action card and then we can capture the treasure
1 : alright and then i have to discard one?
2 : but
2 : you need to discard one so
3 : so
1 : should i just discard this one since we already have to other
2 : yeah yeah
1 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : yup i don't know, yeah that one sorry.
2 : ok
2 : so
1 : so
2 : now you have to do three water's rise
1 : 
1 : oh he needs to do the treasure cards first yeah
2 : oh you didn't ok
3 : sandbags
3 : and then
3 : the purple thing
1 : ok huh
2 : ok
2 : ha
2 : umm
3 : cause
1 : and then the
3 : sandbag's can be used at any time
3 : so should i just
3 : shore up something first?
1 : i mean
1 : do we need to shore up anything? yeah
3 : or, i mean we don't really need those two
2 : yeah
1 : i mean it
1 : wouldn't be good to lose it but
3 : let's wait yeah
1 : we're not gonna lose that one immediately either since its the card is right here.
1 : i think
1 : and those are all the ones we already draw so
2 : ok yeah
1 : ok draw three of these?
2 : yeah
1 : do you want to hold them or should i just?
3 : yeah
3 : sure
3 : iron gate, temple of the moon
3 : and cities of abandon
2 : temple of the moon
2 : iron gate is gone
2 : so put the card in there too
3 : and then
1 : that was another one
3 : cities of abandon
1 : oh this one
1 : cliffs of abandon
2 : cliffs of abandon?
3 : yeah
1 : i think is there another one? ok
2 : ok you're fine
3 : sorry
1 : no it's fine. it looked like cities from here too actually.
3 : ok
3 : so then
2 : hmm
1 : that was like the fun picture of a city.
2 : those go here.
3 : that goes here.
2 : ok that's you then
1 : ok
1 : so i should
2 : yeah
1 : trade these in for a treasure
3 : mmhmm.
1 : so you just put these in the discard pile right?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : do i take this one?
2 : two
1 : yup
2 : ah, i would assume so
3 : i think that's how we get it
1 : move the figurine in front of you, yeah.
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : right so now we should
1 : that was one action right?
2 : try to do this
3 : yeah that was one action
1 : should i go
1 : actually i can't get all the way over there
3 : wait if you have two, i have one
2 : yeah
2 : you could umm
1 : should i just
2 : shore up
1 : go here and shore up these two.
2 : yeah, yeah do that.
1 : cause i can't reach there to shore up that one.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah let's do that
2 : mm.
1 : alright do i need to do another action or should i just
2 : i think that was two more
2 : cause you moved
1 : yeah yeah you're right, you're totally right yeah.
2 : and then
2 : ok
1 : awesome
2 : umm and then you get two treasure cards
1 : thank you
3 : do you have a purple one? yes. ok.
1 : yes.
2 : alright, awesome, awesome.
1 : so we have to get these two.
2 : and then three
2 :  
2 : wait
2 : should we use sandbags to shore up temple of the moon before she no it's
2 : it's right there. never mind.
1 : we can keep pull 
2 : umm well not right now, i don't know if there's two. i don't think there would be two cause we'll have to put
1 : yeah
1 : two of them in there.
1 : yeah right
2 : both of them in that. ok. yeah.
1 : ok
1 : so should i pull these three?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah you're right.
1 : howling garden.
1 : crimson forest and copper gate.
2 : howling garden.
3 : copper
1 : hmm crimson forest
2 : ok so we definitely need to shore this up
2 : and that
3 : umm
3 : yeah
2 : umm it's my turn
2 : so
2 : i'll mo
2 : m
2 : move
1 : wait hold on a second. should we, we have four of these now. should we try and get these two?
2 : yeah
2 : yeah so i'm gonna move there and shore it up and then you guys can meet me there.
3 : do we wait
1 : what would be the fastest way to do this?
3 : do we all have to be on the same tile though?
2 : umm i did
3 : if we, wait if you give a treasure you have to be on the same tile correct?
1 : to give a but unless you are the
2 : i don't have to be
1 : she doesn't have to be
3 : you don't have to be?
2 : ah
1 : but can you give more than two because would it make more sense to try and like umm
1 : you give it to him and i move to him and then he goes there or something
3 : and then i fly
3 : and then, and then i fly or i only have to fly? yeah.
1 : or like he flies like he moves and gives it me and then i try to go there.
2 : ok so
1 : or can you only move one card?
2 : give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card, so it would be two actions. so
3 : oh yeah
1 : but then so you could do that
2 : i'll shore up temple of the moon
1 : yeah
2 : and then i'll give you
3 : what?
3 : wait what if you give them
3 : where's i'm here
1 : give them to me i think
3 : give them to you and then i'll fly and give
1 : he'll give it me and then i can go there. i can go one, two and then get it.
3 : yeah
3 : yeah it's easier to give them to her
1 : that would be my third action
2 : ok
1 : i think that makes sense
2 : we also need to shore up howling garden though
3 : to engineer
1 : but we have this
2 : yeah
3 : i have a sandbag card
1 : worst comes to worse
2 : ok, ok, ok so
1 : yeah we'll be yeah, we'll be fine i think
2 : you can have those so that's three of my actions
1 : that's three oh yeah
3 : ok
2 : and you have five cards so i'll pull
1 : mmhmm.
2 : two treasure cards, oh water's rise
1 : not 
2 : ok
2 : umm sooo
1 : shall i look it up for you?
2 : should we sandbags?
3 : oh yeah we can do it now.
3 : alright
2 : yeah do you want wanna use
3 : ok
1 : or should we save sandbags in case we like really need it
2 : yours?
3 : i think we should at least sandbag howling garden so i'm gonna sandbag howling garden.
2 : i think we should sandbag howling gardens
1 : ok
2 : ok
2 : umm so now i pick three
2 : cliffs of abandon, temple of the moon
2 : cirmson forest
1 : oh we lost this one.
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so that was it
2 : for me so now it's your turn
1 : yeah
1 : so it's his turn so he's moving to give the
3 : ok
1 : the earth, i don't know what is it? earth stone or something like that?
3 : the yeah the purple one.
1 : the purple one
3 : ok
3 : so
1 : do you want to move?
3 : where am i? i have to move
1 : to mine, to give it to me.
3 : to yours to give it to you and then
2 : yeah
1 : and then i'll take my turn and move one, two and then the third action will be getting the treasure
3 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : good plan
2 : umm ok but
1 : then i which one should i
1 : get rid of here?
3 : i have to do oh
1 : should i get rid of this one since we already have
3 : ah
3 : yeah because then we have two lion
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : umm and then ok so that was
2 : two moves
1 : yeah
3 : uh huh
2 : so maybe
3 : oh i hadn't flip this over
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : so three
1 : alright and then the treasure cards yeah.
3 : and now the draw two
2 : now treasure cards
3 : ok another lion
3 : good and another helicopter lift
2 : good good ok.
2 : umm and then three flood cards
1 : then three of these
1 : breaker's bridge whispering garden and copper gate
1 : so this one's gone
1 : hmm, awesome
2 : ok
1 : ok so move here, so one action, two actions and this will be the third
2 : so now it's your turn
2 : you can move
2 : two
2 : and then
2 : ok
1 : then i
1 : pull two treasure cards right?
2 : yeah
1 : thank you
2 : lovely
1 : and then this one right?
1 : the three of these?
2 : yes but
2 : should
3 : we sandbag
2 : we sandbag
1 : oh very true, very true
2 : whispering garden
1 : i think we just called whispering, we just pulled whispering garden and temple of the moon.i think we should save a sandbag just in case like
1 : fool's landing goes down
2 : ok, ok yeah
3 : true, ok yeah and then also
1 : you know what i mean?
1 : like we don't also need this one right?
2 : we don't need it anymore
3 : no we don't need it anymore
1 : yeah we just need
3 : we just need another treasure yeah
1 : the this one? yeah
2 : these two, ok. so yeah just pull them.
1 : ok
3 : and then o
3 : ok yeah
1 : alright that's umm
1 : silver gate, cave of embers and howling garden.
1 : this one yeah sorry i know that was my fault.
3 : oh sorry.
2 : silver gate
2 : alright so now we definitely have to shore up
1 : one of those
2 : howling garden or whispering gate
1 : umm
2 : umm
2 : it's my turn right?
1 : yeah you can move and
2 : yeah so i'll
2 : go to cliffs of abandon, shore this up

2 : well
2 : i think
3 : who's closest? well it doesn't
3 : i can
2 : yeah no one, i'm closest to here.

2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : oh

2 : which one
1 : well we have four of these now

2 : oh wait i didn't see that he had two. ok well you have two, so i'll just give it to you.
3 : ok
3 : do we have, so we don't have to be on the same tile?
2 : no, i don't
1 : no and she doesn't have to be
3 : oh you don't ok cause you've got your special power
2 : i think that's why it's called the messenger yeah. alright, now i'll pull these two.
3 : ok
2 : oh you have to get rid of
2 : the card
3 : me?
2 : yeah get rid of one of you helicopter lifts

3 : whispering garden
3 : by using a helicopter lift
1 : you can
1 : i cann't cause i can only give it to you once it's my turn
1 : so we're gonna have to wait another turn for you to
3 : oh
3 : ok
2 : so you should shore up coral palace first of all because you are on it
1 : and than ah
3 : ok so that's one
2 : umm
1 : i guess you could just
1 : you can move to whispering garden
2 : and then
1 : or no fly me to whispering garden, no wait
1 : that was one, two three
1 : you can move to whispering garden and then use one of your helicopter lift cards to move me to whispering garden
3 : mm.
2 : yeah
1 : or you even we can just wait until your turn and you could give him your card too, we don't have to move me, we can just save the helicopter lift
1 : for when we wanna leave
3 : i have two helicopter lifts too so
1 : but like she can just give it to you as part of her turn she dones't have to be next to you
2 : cause we have to wait anyways
1 : cause we have to wait around anyways for you to use it.
3 : ok yeah so let's do that
2 : so
1 : so just go to like
1 : whispering garden i guess
2 : umm ok wait
2 : so you have
1 : that's the three
2 : was that one or two turns? cause you can fly anywhere on the board
3 : that was, that would have been two

3 : and then i can flip
2 : flip one of them
3 : one of them doesn't matter which one i f

1 : flip
2 : i would do breaker's bridge because it looks like more of a umm
1 : yeah just
3 : whichever one's like connected to things
