2 : ok
4 : ok
3 : go ahead
3 : umm
1 : oh
4 : so let's
1 : i go first
3 : would
4 : let's give you the cards for the green thing, if we get them and
2 : yeah, i feel like you should move and try to shore up tiles.
1 : shore up all these things? these
2 : yeah, as much as you
3 : yeah wo
3 : what color are you? red?
1 : red
1 : red, yeah.
2 : yeah, she's she's at bronze gate.
3 : so, can you move there and then shore up that and
1 : mmhmm yeah
4 : mmhmm mmhmm
3 : oh, you can only do three moves total
1 : that's three.
2 : yeah
2 : that's fine.
3 : moving is one.
1 : moving
2 : moving's one and then shoring up the one you're on it and then she has her isn't her power to
2 : shore up
2 : two
1 : do two? yeah.
3 : oh ok, yeah
1 : for one action
2 : yeah, that makes sense
2 : that's good.
3 : ok so you can like move here and shore up all
1 : well does that mean i can do four, though?
1 : like
2 : shore up both of those and then move and then shore up two more?
1 : like move
1 : shore these two up
3 : no, cause you'd only have one action left.
2 : or, you could, you could shore up these two first.
4 : uh
3 : like moving shh
4 : right
2 : move, shore up these two.
1 : mmhmm
3 : oh
3 : that's four moves
2 : shore up
2 : oh wait, is that shore up for is that for two?
1 : hmm?
2 : hold on, what's your
1 : shore up two tiles
2 : for one action
4 : oh right
3 : like it'll be move
2 : you could shore up these two
4 : do you shore up
4 : move, eh
1 : you can't do
2 : that's, that's one
3 : oh ok, yeah no, you're right. you're right. you're right.
1 : not diagonal, though.
2 : move and then shore up two.
3 : yeah, yeah you don't have to
4 : right, right right right
1 : i don't think i can do them diagonal
2 : no those aren't diagonal. these are adjacent.
4 : here
3 : no like
1 : ok.
3 : move one
2 : no no no, adja
3 : never mind, action one.
2 : uh flip these two first
3 : yeah yeah
4 : i think there's a number of ways you could do it
3 : yeah
2 : yeah just
3 : i think
3 : yeah
1 : ok so that's the first move
2 : that's the first move
3 : and then you move to the temple of the moon
4 : right right
2 : yeah, and then
2 : shore up these two
3 : and then shore up those and that's three
1 : and then shore these up
3 : three
1 : that's three moves. ok.
2 : yeah
3 : actions
2 : ok
2 : and then
2 : two treasure deck cards
2 : oh crap
1 : and i have to do this one immediately?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : so, do that
2 : and then
2 : you have to
4 : can i see that card?
1 : do we have to put, shuffle these in now?
2 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : move the water, then shuffle, discard, then place on top
2 : and then discard the water ok done.
2 : and then you have to
2 : draw that equal to the water level so two
1 : lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon
2 : lost lagoon
2 : cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
2 : ok
2 : umm so i'm at silver gate
2 : and what do you guys think?
1 : what's your
1 : power?
2 : my power is yeah, i can just give treasure cards. but all i have are these two.
1 : give treasure cards
3 : does it count as a move?
2 : umm
2 : yeah so if i give one of them to you guys it counts as a move.
3 : ok
4 : ok
2 : but at this point
3 : i don't think it
1 : there's nothing
3 : makes sense yet.
2 : yeah i feel like i should just shore up cliffs
2 : cliffs of abandon in case that gets shuffled.
3 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : wait, can you do it that way?
1 : wait wait
2 : yeah but i'd have to go one, two and then i'd still have one move,
1 : oh ok
1 : ok
1 : one, two and then
1 : ok
2 : and then
2 : do do you want to start collecting the gold ones?
1 : wait, wasn't that three moves already?
2 : uh
4 : umm
2 : it's one, two.
1 : one
3 : yeah
1 : two and then shoring up.
2 : and then, oh yeah. you're right, you're right.
1 : so that's
4 : yeah, why not?
3 : or couldn't you just move to he like have, just move to there and flip it cause you're next to it?
2 : oh, yeah that's true. ok, so
3 : so then
1 : ok so one
3 : you can
2 : one, two
3 : if you really want to give him that one
1 : two
2 : and then
2 : do you want
2 : do you want to start
4 : yeah why not? i'm
2 : ok
4 : provisionally
2 : provisionally
4 : gettin the gold ones
2 : alright
2 : and then
2 : draw two, wait, right?
3 : yeah
2 : two treasure deck cards
3 : mmhmm
2 : oh, crap. i should've given you that one.
2 : umm, that was dumb.
3 : and then the
2 : and then
3 : flood
2 : the flood tiles, so two.
3 : yeah
2 : breaker's bridge and phantom rock.
2 : breaker's
3 : well
2 : o
2 : k
3 : do you have the card?
2 : yeah, breaker's bridge. or is that phantom rock?
3 : phantom rock
2 : umm, where's this one?
2 : oh, ok.
3 : ok.
1 : and you got
1 : yeah, ok.
2 : so
2 : pilot, blue, on fool's landing.
3 : umm should i go
3 : like
3 : i can move anywhere so should i move here and then shore both of those?
4 : well she's right near them and she can do two at once.
2 : yeah so she could do right.
4 : so you probably want to do that one if you're gonna shore one up.
3 : oh, good call.
1 : what is that little yellow thing?
2 : that just means that's where yellow starts but we don't have a yellow person.
1 : oh ok. got it.
3 : so does it it doesn't matter whether i move here or here, though. like
3 : should i
3 : stay here?
1 : i mean if we lost golden gate would it
1 : like matter?
2 : no
2 : i guess not but
4 : cause it's on an edge.
2 : like i get
3 : it's just it's just like
3 : it's not like i've
4 : yeah
2 : how many do we wanna yeah it's not like she has much else to do.
3 : better better things to do
1 : that's true.
3 : unless
3 : like
3 : i don't know
2 : uh
4 : well maybe
1 : why not?
3 : cause we might not make it back around to you before these
4 : better than nothing cause what if it's like we need to get, like, to this thing to get the gold ones.
1 : yeah
3 : go down
2 : oh wait, actually, maybe
1 : that's true, yeah.
4 : so
2 : if
2 : if we get a flood card or something and then these get drawn up
2 : soon it might make sense to at least turn over some of these
3 : yeah, cause this isn't already pulled up, right?
2 : yeah, that one's not there.
3 : so why don't i move here?
3 : and then shore this, too.
2 : just, yeah.
2 : fix those.
3 : so that's three moves
3 : umm
3 : and these two
4 : alright
3 : ok i got another helicopter lift card and
2 : ok
3 : you have two of those, ok.
4 : how did you shore up two of them?
2 : well she moved to one, yeah.
3 : i my power is to move anywhere
3 : as an action.
4 : oh right, right. i understand.
3 : uh ok, so gold uh well ok, bye.
2 : it's gone now
3 : can you look oh there's the card and
2 : and then the purple one that's temple of the moon
3 : mmhmm
2 : oh i guess this should be, eh it doesn't they're already shuffled.
4 : ok
2 : alright
4 : so i'll just move and uh shore that one up. i don't see anything else i can do.
2 : ok
4 : so
2 : shore that
2 : and then you need to go to a golden one
4 : i guess i will move
4 : yeah, i guess i'll move in this
2 : that one's closer, though
4 : direct, oh there's two of them
2 : well
3 : just like, you could just move towards it
2 : yeah
3 : like, you you need four before you can do it anyway
2 : misty, yeah
4 : yeah, i'll just stay in this area and i'll plan to
2 : that's fine.
4 : discard down there. ok, umm
2 : here's two cards
4 : two treasure cards
2 : and then
2 : did you get a flood one? no.
4 : no
2 : solid. ok you have five. ok, no more for you.
4 : ok, whispering garden and iron
2 : what are they?
4 : gate.
2 : iron gate.
1 : ok
3 : wait, these don't have to be used during my turn, do they?
2 : they can use be used at any time.
3 : ok, well just so you know i have two helicopter lifts
2 : yeah
4 : look at that
1 : so giving a treasure card is a move, right?
1 : ok
2 : mmhmm
1 : if we needed to do that
2 : and don't worry like, i can also give
4 : ok
2 : cards
2 : like right? i can give
1 : you can give other people's cards
4 : you
2 : ok, so you could give me one of your cards if you wanted to
2 : i don't know
1 : oh, that's true.
4 : ok, so let's say pilot
1 : so it's my turn
1 : oh
2 : yeah
4 : oh, sorry. i was saying, pilot, why don't you take the purple treasure because you have one.
1 : no, you're fine
2 : yeah
4 : and
2 : we don't need to collect all of them so the ones that are out the most all of these are out.
2 : so
2 : maybe
4 : so i'll need to give, give that to, to on the next
1 : people need to start giving me
2 : yeah, start giving them to you, right.
1 : ok. so then i should just give this maybe to somebody or should i try to do something else?
4 : to you on the next turn
2 : engineer, at this point it doesn't really matter. ok, so you're trying to go to a place where there's there's this.
3 : it doesn't real it doesn't really matter nnhmm.
1 : yeah
4 : right, right
2 : so you should move like over this way, or that way. it doesn't matter.
1 : ok
2 : uh maybe move
1 : just move, the whole time?
2 : move two and then give that to me, i guess?
1 : ok
3 : yeah
4 : or you could, you might want to shore that might be a good idea
1 : i shouldn't try to shore anything up
2 : oh yeah actually whispering gardens, yeah
4 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : ok so one, two, and then shore it up.
2 : cause it's
3 : yeah
1 : i don't have to be on it
3 : no
2 : wait, yours is shore up two tiles and just yeah ok yeah
1 : yeah
3 : yeah but
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : right
1 : one, two
2 : sounds good
1 : ok
1 : treasure
1 : she can
1 : move us all if she wanted to.
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : water's rise
2 : water rise
3 : uh
1 : oh oh
2 : alright
2 : so then shuffle the flood discard pile, if you wanna do that. then place it on top.
2 : then put that there.
1 : ok
2 : ok
2 : and then you took you took your treasure cards, you took your disc yeah
1 : and now i need to
1 : do these.
2 : and then
1 : right
2 : mm
2 : no, no, no, you don't wait did you already do that? or no. you havn't done that. yeah yeah yeah. you ju
3 : no
3 : yes
1 : no
3 : wait cause you got
1 : cause i got a water's card
3 : oh this is a treasure card, yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : yeah so now she has to take
1 : i have to take three
3 : oh god
3 : ok
4 : someone's gonna have to explain the whole like
1 : breaker's bridge
2 : iron
2 : iron gate
1 : cliffs of abandon
2 : iron gate's gone now.
1 : ok
2 : umm cliffs of abandon
2 : here
2 : and then breaker's bridge
2 : is here, ok.
3 : and then, that's it.
1 : ok
2 : alright
3 : your turn.
2 : yeah
2 : ok so i am
3 : do you wanna
2 : misty marsh
3 : give your card
3 : oh but you also probably wanna flip things
2 : yeah ok so i'm there
3 : you could flip that as one,
2 : mmhmm
3 : give that as one,
4 : you can, you can give it to me.
2 : right
4 : you don't need to give it to me right now
3 : oh if you
1 : you can't because he'll lose one of his. or you can
3 : wait
4 : well then
1 : it's ok, i guess if he loses it
3 : but then
4 : we should decide which umm
4 : sorry
3 : you don't wanna discard
4 : we need three of the four so sometime, maybe not now, but we should decide which of the ones we're not going to get, to pursue
1 : yeah
2 : to get which one
3 : i'll take these
2 : well cause three of those are the purple ones are already out, the gold ones are already out and the
2 : they're all four of the
3 : so we're
1 : so get rid of the fire
4 : so
2 : get rid of the fire ones
3 : don't care about that, but you don't have one of those, so you can't get that to him yet
4 : fire
4 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : so that means you definitely don't wanna
3 : yeah
3 : you need all of yours.
2 : you need yeah
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : umm shore up hmm
2 : i get to shore up both of those
1 : ok
2 : i don't know what else i would do
1 : do we need
1 : what's the sandbag do?
2 : oh we can shore up these at any time
1 : shore up any of the tile oh ok
2 : so
2 : i mean
1 : ok
1 : so we don't have to do that yet.
4 : you may
4 : since we're all near this to shore up maybe you should
4 : give me one of the golden ones cause one of us will probably have a
2 : no we can't give you the gold one right now cause all you can only hold five and every single one of those is important.
3 : because you have to discard them.
4 : oh
4 : he can't give it if i have five, i see, ok
2 : right, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : no, that's a move
2 : or i can but then you have to discard one and we need all of those.
3 : yeah
4 : right, right, i understand
3 : yeah
3 : so
4 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : umm
3 : why don't you
1 : hmm
3 : i mean like i don't know if it's worth doing this now but you could like shore this up cause you're next to it
2 : yeah
3 : and then use that card for this one.
4 : mmhmm mmhmm
2 : well so i have three turns, so i could
2 : move, shore up,
2 : move
2 : and then yeah that's ok
3 : yeah
1 : we give four
2 : fair, and then should i just do that?
3 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : move and then here and then shore this up
1 : wait wasn't that four turns?
3 : you
3 : that was four turns, so just like
1 : then you can't shore it up
2 : oh just gonna stay here
2 : oh i can't shore that one up
3 : use the i was saying use this card
2 : oh ok
2 : sure
3 : so
1 : oh ok if you use that you should
1 : yeah
3 : and then
2 : then
4 : hmm
2 : draw two
3 : yeah
2 : more sandbags and a lion
2 : are there ok
2 : and then
2 : one, two, and three
3 : three
2 : lost lagoon,
2 : umm
2 : temple of moon and whispering garden
3 : alright
3 : is this me now?
3 : ok does anyone need to move anywhere or
4 : someone need no everyone's in a good location.
3 : i, i could just make these two of my moves
3 : you know?
1 : do you wanna give me that
1 : umm
2 : yeah the chalice
3 : oh yeah
4 : yeah you should let's start giving each other the
1 : chalice
3 : sure, ok. one, two, three. is that ok if i flip these as my other two actions?
2 : yeah that sounds fine.
2 : oh just kidding
2 : 
3 : oh just kidding
2 : just kidding
1 : oh it has to be on the same one
2 : bring it back
2 : that's only me
3 : that's your power, ok
3 : umm
1 : who
3 : i
1 : what color are you?
3 : could
3 : i'm blue so it would take me like my whole turn to give it to you.
1 : oh yeah
4 : oh yeah cause you have to be in the same on the same like
3 : should i
1 : s
4 : place to exchange.
2 : umm
1 : so shoring these up is two moves, right?
3 : should i just shore those two?
4 : i didn't realize that
3 : yeah
2 : yeah and i feel like if you're gonna draw three anyways, like three flood cards, it's probably likely that we're gonna have to like start flooding and like losing things.
1 : yeah i'd shore them up.
3 : so that's
3 : should i just do that?
2 : yeah
3 : and do
1 : we might lose the lion.
3 : i
3 : is there anything else like
2 : umm wait you wanna who, both of
2 : who's the red and the green?
2 : ok explorer. ok, you could fly the explorer to here, howling gardens
1 : i'm the red.
2 : and then next time i can give both of mine to him
4 : oh huh
2 : and then he can take the treasure.
4 : yeah
3 : but you would have to use his moves to like give me those or something.
4 : i can do that.
3 : ok, so
2 : yeah
3 : i'm lifting
2 : both the red
1 : well that means he'd have to be on the same tile as you to give
4 : yeah wait, wh which, which color are you?
3 : oh
2 : but shh
3 : ok, i if i use my, if i use the lift
4 : let's stay close together so we can
3 : put him like on the same tile as me, he can give them
1 : yeah
3 : right after i'm done.
1 : mmhmm
4 : right, right
3 : and then
3 : i can use my i have two cards so i can like after you give them
1 : then he can start
2 : yeah
1 : he can go over there
3 : do you have to give those during your turn?
2 : umm yeah
4 : yeah, it takes an action to, to give, to give umm
2 : it takes yeah so this would give me it would take two of my actions
2 : umm but currently he's really, like next to me so he could he could move and then give both to me
2 : and then
2 : you
2 : could somehow
2 : fly
2 : then someone else can get on my tile
2 : so the engineer could get on my tile and then we could fly to howling gardens and get this one done
4 : wait, who?
3 : ok
4 : who's giving the golden one's in? i don't i don't care
4 : is it you or uh, eh
3 : wait, just to finish up my turn, since these these don't count as like
2 : it co it depends.
3 : a move
2 : mmhmm
3 : so how about i just like finish the rest and when we get to him we'll figure out
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : what we're gonna do.
3 : ok
2 : oh, there's multiple
3 : and i have to discard one which is this good
3 : does it go in here?
3 : or no, here.
2 : uh, actually wait. you should get rid of the gold one cause we don't need that one anymore
1 : yeah
2 : if he's here oh well
2 : you could give
4 : a gold one?
2 : don't we
4 : why don't we need the gold one?
1 : well we're not using the fire one.
3 : yeah, let's just get rid of this one.
2 : yeah, ok.
4 : you mean the fire one?
2 : well, if say if i if i redeemed like if you uh like ended up giving me both of those gold cards and i redeemed it for the statue
2 : then
2 : we'd have a fire uh i don't know.
1 : yeah
3 : but we don't need all of them, do we?
4 : i thought we agreed we weren't using the fire one.
3 : like we don't
3 : do we need all of the treasures?
2 : no no no, we don't need all of the treasures but
2 : i just i don't know like
2 : worst case scenario or something
4 : i don't understand that
3 : i would i would just say like i don't
2 : just yeah, ok.
3 : i feel like it's better to have a fifth on of these in case then
1 : yeah
2 : in case? ok.
3 : like a
3 : a third one of these. like that's not gonna do much for us. ok.
2 : yeah
3 : and then what?
3 : three of those
3 : copper gate
2 : temple of sun
2 : crimson forest and what's the last one?
2 : there.
3 : copper gate
3 : alright
4 : ok, so i will
4 : flip these two over
4 : or should i spend the two
3 : i think
3 : mm
4 : ok which
1 : wait
4 : which i'm green. i'm sorry, i confuses two colors.
1 : ok
1 : were you gonna fly him and he was gonna use his turn to give these?
1 : to her
3 : then i would have to dis
1 : her
3 : well no. i'd only have discard one
3 : card
3 : if i used a helicopter
2 : yes
2 : so he could move one, use one turn like one of his turns
2 : then you'd fly us both here. and then he could use the rest of his two turns to give me those two things and then the next time i would play i could redeem it for a treasure
1 : to fly two people do they have to be on the same thing, to start with?
2 : yeah
3 : so, you do wanna flip
3 : is is what you're saying like he flips and then i move you?
2 : no no no, he would have to move we'd have to be together. then you'd have to redeem the helicopter thing and then we'd both be here. he'd have to give me both cards and those would each be a turn.
2 : does that make sense?
4 : ok i'm i'm i'm confused. what do you want me to do, messenger? messenger, what do you
1 : yeah
3 : ok, yeah no i get it
3 : ok
3 : ac
4 : it's unclear to me what exactly you're you're asking me to do. i'm i'm confused.
3 : 
3 : to give her these.
3 : so, action one
2 : yeah, so i could redeem these for the next time.
4 : ok
3 : this is you, right? action one
4 : ok
4 : mmhmm
3 : is a move.
2 : mmhmm
3 : then i'll use my card.
2 : to move us both
2 : here, to howling gardens
3 : there.
2 : and then you still have two turns left, so you would give me
3 : you have two turns
3 : give her those.
2 : those
2 : the two gold ones.
2 : makes sense
1 : and you have
1 : too many. so you have to
2 : i have five.
3 : yeah
2 : oh and then this one. so, fire, yeah.
1 : so you have to get rid of the fire.
3 : so get rid of that.
3 : ok
4 : mmhmm
4 : water rise and goblet.
2 : alright, water rise.
2 : and then shuffle these
2 : how much time do we have?
1 : eighteen more minutes.
3 : eighteen?
2 : oh, eighteen, oh uh
1 : or else we lose
2 : great
2 : oh great. so uh, speed it up.
2 : umm, ok. so then water rise and then you got your treasure and you're done is that everything?
1 : oh so it's my turn.
3 : no
4 : no, i did not draw
2 : your turn
3 : he
2 : we didn't
3 : didn't do the
4 : i did draw
3 : you didn't do the flood cards, right?
4 : no, umm
1 : ok, so you need three.
2 : oh the flood cards, sorry.
4 : oh temple of the moon
1 : uh oh.
1 : ok
2 : temple
2 : yeah
1 : cliffs
2 : of abandon
4 : and lost lagoon
3 : oh, that's fine. we're just
2 : ok
2 : alright
1 : woah
4 : ok
2 : and now
1 : i have some serious shoring up to do.
3 : yeah
3 : can
3 : are you the one you can do multiple in one move?
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : two
3 : can you do diagonally? oh, no.
1 : no
4 : no, i can do it diagonally.
1 : i can't do them diagonal.
3 : ok, so you could do these two, move
3 : just kid yeah. these two, move, these two?
1 : no
2 : yeah she could do these two, move
4 : two and then
2 : and then
3 : oh, just kidding.
1 : that's diagonal.
2 : oh, no, no, no wait, yeah. shoot.
3 : you can only do two.
4 : no
3 : umm
1 : could do move
2 : uh
1 : no
1 : 
4 : well this would be the least important one because it's in like a corner.
2 : mm
1 : ok
3 : one, two, three.
2 : and we don't even really need whispering gardens anyways. we actually don't.
1 : ok
3 : right?
1 : ok
2 : do you see this? cause that's we already have this one, we're gonna be done.
2 : so, you could just do these two
2 : move
2 : this one?
4 : yeah, this has no util this has absolutely no utility and this has minimal utility.
3 : that would work.
2 : crimson yeah.
1 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : right, so
1 : ok, so do these two
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : then move over to silver gate and then temple of the moon.
1 : ok
2 : cool. ok, so then my first oh and then you need to do the stuff.
1 : and i'm gonna have too many treasures.
3 : here
2 : ok
1 : 
2 : and then you need to do three.
2 : so whispering breaker's bridge
1 : we lost whispering garden
4 : oh
2 : breaker's bridge is done and crimson forest. where's crimson forest?
4 : yeah
1 : that's gone too.
2 : oh ok
2 : that's fine.
1 : alright
2 : umm ok so my turn. so then no you're done or, those were your flood cards weren't they?
3 : no, no, no
1 : no
1 : no yeah they were
2 : no oh wait
1 : yeah
3 : they were. i'm so confused, i don't remember what just happened, but yeah.
2 : yeah yeah
4 : 
1 : yeah they were
3 : ok
2 : yeah, oh yeah, ok
1 : they were.
2 : so then these four get redeemed for the treasure thing.
2 : i don't know what do
1 : the lion
3 : but
4 : hmm why are flood cards being put in here? shouldn't they stay in that pile?
3 : because they're
2 : once they're gone
3 : no because they're, they're
2 : then they don't ever get revived.
3 : done, they're sunk.
1 : we can't have those back.
2 : we can't have them again.
3 : umm ok wait 
2 : alright
3 : no just get
2 : so
1 : so we've captured a
1 : treasure.
2 : yeah you captured a treasure so if you discard four treasures
1 : and that counts as one of your turns i think
2 : yeah mmhmm
3 : yeah it does.
2 : ok so that's done
2 : and then, i, i do we move that or someting?
3 : yeah you can have it.
2 : ok
1 : you can just hold onto that
2 : umm and then
2 : what should i do 
3 : so that was one turn right? ok so
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : i can't shore up anything
2 : but
3 : i can move you
2 : yeah i guess you could move us both
2 : umm you have
1 : that's true yeah
2 : three goblets so
4 : yeah
2 : where's that? if we move both
2 : oh you have two and you have two
2 : uh maybe and you're over, all the way over there. shoot.
4 :  might be
4 : it might be good too for me to shore this up if we need both of the
4 : these in case one of them sinks, i don't know, it's just an idea.
2 : yeah
2 : ok who's, who's blue again?
3 : me
2 : oh pilot, ok
2 : umm
1 : well what's the next treasure which we're trying to get?
1 : maybe
3 : umm
2 : yeah i think either the purple or the blue
4 : yeah it's unclear to me who is doing what in terms of the treasure
3 : yeah
2 : so you're closest to purple so i think next time
2 : you guys should start giving her the purple things
3 : ok
3 : mmhmm
4 : we should exchange we should get in the same location and we should spend our turns i should get four of the purple and or green or vice versa so we exchange
1 : that
2 : oh yeah like exchange and then capture, yeah
1 : we can't exchange though, but
1 : you can just give. yeah no i get it.
4 : why why
3 : well no like on his turn he can give two to you
2 : so somehow like get to the same places
4 : on our turns
3 : oh no
1 : yeah it won't work really
3 : i see what you're saying cause you would have to end up discarding something.
1 : but there's more i think
3 : you could
3 : give some to me i have one of each like i don't know what that does, but
4 : can we which you're red, you're red, you're over here
1 : ok
1 : mmhmm
4 : i'm over here
2 : you can get pretty close, yeah
4 : so my strategy will be to move towards your area to facilitate an exchange
2 : you might as well just fly like you could just fly us both to temple of moon
4 : yeah
1 : to the temple of the moon?
2 : yeah
3 : right now?
4 : that's a good idea.
3 : are you gonna do a move now or
3 : ok
2 : yeah and then i guess i can shore up breaker's bridge or something. so how many turns do i have left?
3 : yeah.
2 : oh two
3 : two, you just captured
1 : you did one
3 : so you have two actions, right?
2 : so yeah i have two. ok so should i move here and then get lost lagoon as well? like one and then shore up
1 : ok
2 : or no, no, move and shore up i guess. or i can shore up here, right?
4 : what
4 : so what, what have you done so far in your turn? i'm
2 : all i did was capture this, so that's one turn. i still have two actions left.
2 : so
2 : i can flip this tile
1 : ok
2 : right and then
2 : and then i have one more turn so i don't know,
2 : move closer to something else or
3 : you don't have to use it.
2 : yeah, i guess there's no point.
1 : oh that's true, yeah.
1 : ok
2 : ok
3 : yeah.
2 : and then i'll need the two
4 : wait why don't you you'd wanna flip the lost lagoon because if instead of sinking it's shored up that
2 : i can't
2 : it's
2 : diagonal.
3 : he can't.
1 : there's no
2 : it's diagonal, i can't.
3 : she can't.
1 : she doesn't have enough turns left.
2 : yeah i only have one
4 : uh which color are you?
2 : i'm, i'm silver
4 : you're silver, ok i was confused, i thought you were the blue one.
2 : yeah
2 : no that's the pilot. alright so i have two fire it's ok
1 : ok so you got fire
4 : i'm sorry
2 : two fires and then three flood tiles.
2 : alright tidal palace
2 : and temple of the sun.
3 : mmhmm
2 : eh where
3 : mm i don't know
1 : we lost it.
2 : wait how is that
2 : ok.
3 : oh
2 : there you go
2 : and copper gate.
3 : so we can't let
2 : ok
3 : that go.
1 : nnhmm
1 : use sandbags on anything
3 : ok
3 : umm so
4 : ok
3 : flood
3 : cards.
2 : 
3 : did you oh you just pulled them. oh my god i swear ok, i got it. i'm like what's going on.
2 : yeah i just did them, it's your turn. it's ok there's a lot to keep track of.
2 : umm
3 : so
2 : you can fly to any ok
3 : does anyone want a card?
1 : am i getting these?
3 : oh wait i have an idea
1 : bowls?
4 : well what else  save right now it doesn't it's
4 : doesn't matter which one. so you do you like green or purple? which color do you prefer?
2 : yeah
2 : completely even
3 : i have an idea
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : i have an idea. ok so if i use one of my turns to give
1 : doesn't matter.
3 : one of these
4 : well engineer which one, which one are you going to take? which one would you like?
1 : well let's hear what she has to say
2 : it doesn't matter wait yeah
3 : it doesn't matter cause we all have like equal amounts of both. so if i give one or the other
4 : it doesn't matter
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
3 : to you on this turn
3 : then on your turn
3 : your goal would be to give
3 : two of which ever one i don't give you to her and then
3 : like
3 : since there's an extra like you could sacrifice like
1 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : discarding one.
2 : yeah it if, if that's the case then you should give him the purple one because umm yeah cause then you could take temple moon and then
3 : ok
3 : do i have to be on the same thing?
1 : yeah
3 : yeah so
1 : to give
4 : ok i'll take the purple ones and turn them in and you'll take the green ones, engineer
2 : yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : so should i
2 : yeah
3 : ok so my move idea is to
3 : umm
3 : what do you call it? shore, move
2 : and give, yeah
1 : and give, yeah
3 : give
4 : mmhmm, mmhmm
2 : that makes sense.
1 : ok
2 : alright and then two
3 : ok
2 : and then
2 : provided it's not, ok.
2 : and then it's cave of shadows
2 : and silver what?
2 : silver gate
2 : and
3 : dunes of deception
3 : none of which really matter
2 : dunes of decep
2 : none yeah none are important
2 : ok
1 : we don't really wanna lose this, it might make it hard to move around.
2 : yeah
4 : ok so i'll i can shore that up and i'll give you
2 : especially cause that's central
3 : right
4 : i can give you two, right?
3 : you're on the sa oh ok
1 : ok so wait we're on the same
4 : cause i can do it diagonally
3 : no
3 : so you're on are you on the same tile? no
4 : yes
3 : no, cause that's her
1 : no i'm red, so you might wanna move.
4 : oh you're red. i can move.
3 : so
3 : here's your actions
3 : move here,
3 : give two.
4 : and give two
1 : ok
4 : ok i think that's more logical than spending the time to shore up the center square wouldn't
2 : wait but then you have to
4 : does everyone agree with that, cause there's two choices here?
2 : yeah that's fine.
2 : yeah
3 : wait or use, use that no, no, no, here idea use that helicopter card
1 : but then i can
1 : to
3 : to move him to you, then it doesn't use an require an action from him
1 : to move him.
4 : well
2 : that's a good idea.
1 : ok
3 : and then you don't have to discard
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : ok
4 : right, i see, i see, that's a good idea. i'm green, yes.
3 : are you what color are you green?
3 : ok, so then
1 : i
1 : these two?
3 : you still have
1 : three, yeah.
3 : three moves, yeah
4 : so i will give
2 : both of those to her.
3 : yeah
4 : both of these to you
3 : and you can discard one of them yeah
2 : one of yeah
1 : and then should he
3 : cause i still have one just in case.
4 : ok
1 : shore up?
4 : and then
3 : yeah
4 : does it, does it two do i take two actions and give you two cards? or
1 : the silver gate
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : but that was
1 : but i helicopter lifted you
4 : but you helicoptered me over. right
3 : that was your two action
2 : and then you still but you still need to move so you should move here cause you're gonna redeem that purple one soon.
2 : cause the next
1 : well no he should shore this up
4 : i should shore it up
3 : it doesn't matter as much as getting the treasure i think
2 : it isn't cause yeah, you need to get the treasure, more importantly.
1 : ok
1 : oh that's true.
3 : so i think that should be your
2 : cause you're not gonna swim or flood or anything, you'll be fine.
3 : third action.
3 : so
4 : so what
2 : he'll be ok
3 : so move here so that like next turn she can oh wait maybe you wanna stay, you wanna stay
2 : yeah
4 : so we're on the same tile to facilitate a transfer
4 : well we should be on the same square
3 : will you be able
1 : we probably should stay on the same one so i can give him the
2 : ok yeah then so just wait.
4 : it's logical to shore it up if i understand the rules correctly.
3 : but no, no, no hol
3 : if, if he moves now, you can use a move
3 : to move to him and give him the card.
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : cause he if it it's better isn't it better or no, capturing a treasure has to happen in his turn anyway
1 : does anyone else have a helicopter card right now? no
2 : no
3 : no
4 : no, so i should
1 : are you able to lift, are you able to move me anywhere on your turn?
3 : ok i think
2 : if there's another person with you
3 : i think it's just me.
3 : no, no, no that's
4 : ok so i'm going to shore this up with my last move
2 : oh no that's the helicopter card, yeah, yeah.
3 : that's just me, just me, yeah.
1 : you can only move yourself.
4 : ex excuse me, i'm gonna shore this up with my last action.
1 : mm
3 : yeah, i think that's probably
3 : the best.
1 : ok so i can't get this treasure yet
4 : ok
4 : ok so i need two treasure cards
1 : so you need to yeah
2 : and then three flood cards
4 : mm
2 : so it's these three
2 : bronze gate,
4 : bronze gate,
2 : cave of embers and the tornadoey one.
3 : ok
2 : alright, your turn.
2 : engineer, so
1 : so
1 : i need to get down there but i can't this turn.
4 : so if you'd want to spend
3 : i think that
3 : you ok first step, give him the purple.
4 : you'd want to give me a purple and umm as one of your actions.
2 : yeah
4 : thank you
2 : and then throw away the red i guess
4 : mmhmm
2 : oh you no why don't you just throw away the blue the blue one just in case.
3 : oh yeah
1 : yeah
2 : cause it doesn't we already we're done.
3 : i mean i think we already got rid of too many of these to be able to do it but
4 : right so you're you, you have red so it looks like it's logical that
2 : i ll still have red yeah
4 : unlike we have
2 : maybe if but both of these might go under, yeah.
3 : there's not
1 : ok
4 : changing the original plan then you will get the red and try to turn them in.
1 : so one,
1 : umm
2 : umm
3 : should you just try to get closer to here?
1 : yeah like two
4 : mmhmm
3 : that's all you're trying to do right? to just go there
2 : yeah yeah
4 : yeah that seems logical
1 : yeah just move to like breaker's bridge or something
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : uh water rises so here you go
3 : mm
4 : yeah we should start thinking of getting close to fool's landing if we have extra turns
1 : wait can i
3 : we need to be able to
1 : ok so i got a helicopter so i can move myself
3 : ok that's good.
1 : somewhere but i can't do this this turn
1 : anyways so.
3 : yeah save that for when you're getting the treasure i guess.
2 : ok umm and then you just took those and now you need to take three flood cards.
1 : temple of the moon, howling garden
1 : and cave of shadows.
2 : howling garden's gone.
2 : cave of shadows what does that look like?
1 : uh oh, it's gone
1 : that's a problem.
3 : oh bye
3 : now you have the helicopter card
2 :  alright so then i am silver
2 : and i need to 
1 : shore that up
4 : you could shore that up as necessary
2 : yeah
2 : that's really important
1 : do we have enough things left, should we shore other things up?
2 : well ok so you're trying to get here and then that'll be you already have one, two, and three so
3 : umm
3 : 
1 : and then he wants this
3 : on his turn
1 : oh we only need three treasures, ok
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : ooo yeah
4 : yeah it's
3 : so but do you just wanna use another turn for that?
2 : ah we need to hussle.
2 : yeah i was just
1 : yeah we're gonna lose
4 : it's logical to keep them shored up because they'd be less likely to sink
3 : ok
3 : it's fine, we're just gon we wanna win.
2 : right  we gotta, we gotta go.
2 : alright cool alright and then three of these.
3 : mmhmm
2 : cliffs of aban oh just kidding, too many, this one's on the bottom.
2 : bronze gate, i just, ok that just
1 : bronze
2 : it's pointless.
2 : cave of embers
1 : gone
2 : gone.
2 : and then copper gate is
2 : gone.
3 : bye
2 : alright
3 : alright so are there any turns with here i'll uh do like
2 : 
3 : one
3 : just kidding, that's not me.
2 : you'd have to fly move yeah
3 : ok one
2 : fly and f
3 : two
3 : three.
2 : or why don't you save tidal palace?
3 : but she's going here
2 : oh ok
3 : right?
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah ok
4 : ok
3 : ok
3 : and that's for my moves and then i'm gonna do this and
1 : then get your stuff
2 : yeah
3 : umm
2 : is that now you have to get rid of one.
1 : get rid of one of this. you can sandbags oh
3 : this right, cause we already
2 : yeah, yeah we already got that.
2 : and then you need three
3 : and
1 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : one, two, three.
2 : and cliffs of abandon,
2 : lost lagoon, breaker's bridge.
3 : lost lagoon
1 : k
1 : so use your
3 : alright
4 : ok so i'll turn these in
3 : get the treasure.
2 : redeem, great
3 : turn one, congratulation
4 : see, why do i do i put them here or
3 : uh
2 : no, no, here
3 : here
2 : oh just kidding capture a treasure if you discard four matching treasure cards while on the corresponding island tile.
4 : oh i have to be i am on the island
3 : oh you have to move first.
1 : so one
4 : oh, yeah i confused the colors, excuse me.
2 : ok so one
2 : move
4 : hmm
3 : two
1 : two
2 : two
4 : two, i'm sorry i'm
3 : you have one more you can flip something.
2 : and then
1 : shore something up. break do the breaking bridge.
4 : i should
2 : yeah do breaker's bridge.
3 : probably, yeah probably that.
4 : yeah breaker's bridge.
2 : ok then here's the two
2 : and three, ok.
4 : and flood card.
2 : tidal palace,
2 : dunes and silver gate.
2 : who cares?
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : so should i fly myself no we're just gonna move
2 : umm you should just
3 : yeah
1 : fly myself.
3 : fly.
1 : k so
2 : fly, redeem
1 : if i fly
2 : redeem, yeah.
1 : and then get the treasure
2 : and then
1 : probably shouldn't have flown cause now we needed that
2 : oh shoot
3 : oh yeah wait can you, can you like do like
4 : 
2 : reverse that
3 : step, step
1 : so i could go one, two
2 : to redeem.
1 : redeem, ok, and keep that.
2 : ok
4 : yeah, i guess, i guess there's no clear rule about
3 : cause we're gonna
2 : yeah, alright so then you need two of these
3 : ok so now
4 : for sequential actions if you immediately make a mistake, you can take it back i suppose.
3 : don't
3 : ok does she have to finish her turn or can we like fly
2 : wait, wait
3 : and go off the island now?
4 : so if we have three do we have three of the four treasures, i'm a little confused. ok
1 : no we need to all get on the same thing
2 : we do.
2 : yeah we have one, two, and three.
2 : and then
4 : that's what i thought.
2 : we all need to get to here right?
3 : yes
2 : so how, how many
3 : i can get myself there
1 : ok
2 : thanks
2 : alright, solid. but
3 : i'll leave you all behind
1 : so i should just finish my turn, do the, like stuff
2 : yeah you don't have any more moves left
1 : do i have to do the
2 : yeah do you have anymore moves left or no?
3 : yeah
1 : no
2 : no, ok
3 : ok then yeah.
1 : did i need treasures?
2 : did you get these two cards already? no, ok
1 : i don't think so
2 : in case there's a flood? yeah great.
3 : yeah hmm
2 : flood shuffle
2 : done. and then, ok, then you need to take three  cards.
1 : four
2 : oh yeah four, great.
2 : dunes of whatever are gone, oh shoot. ok, this is out.
1 : 
3 : well that's gonna be fun.
3 : it's a, it's ok. i'm a pilot, i can fly.
2 : umm cliffs of abandon is gone. oh no
1 : cliffs of
4 : mm
1 : temple of the moon oh we did that. and bronze gate.
2 : oh shoot
3 : umm
2 : temple of the moon
4 : yeah i can't move diagonal
2 : and bronze gate.
4 : you can't move diagonally, correct?
2 : right, yeah
1 : oh yeah we're gonna have to fly
2 : so
2 : the p
4 : mk this is problematic.
3 : well we just all have to get to the same tile and use that card.
1 : so it's your turn so try to get somewhere
2 : but we need to get to fool's landing though, right?
3 : you can use your turn to get here.
1 : no i'm red
2 : yeah she's red. i'm, i'm gray.
3 : oh what are you?
1 : so you should fly to
1 : move here.
2 : what i am there. that's i am gray.
1 : oh who's green?
4 : no yeah you're gray.
3 : ok who's red? you're red.
4 : green
1 : so i can move myself there.
3 : you stay right?
2 : ok
3 : or 
3 : flip i mean
2 : yeah so flip one, two, and or
2 : i can flip adjacent and then  the same one.
3 : ok here's how it's gonna work. we'll use a pilot card to get these people here, i can fly myself on my turn and you can use two turns to get there.
1 : so
1 : i can move myself.
2 : ok so i'll just flip
3 : so just shore
3 : just shore things, yeah.
2 : one, two, and three.
3 : yeah
3 : and then finish your turn.
2 : one and two
2 : umm
3 : two minutes, no pressure.
2 : throw them out. i don't know.
2 : and then one, two, three
2 : ok that's four.
2 : so misty marsh is now in danger
2 : silver gate is in danger. lagoon is gone
2 : and breaker's bridge is
4 : no
2 : in danger, alright.
4 : perfect role for me on my turn.
3 : alright now my turn is i'm just
1 : 
1 : your turn.
3 : wait i'll shore this
