3 : alright team we got this, ok
1 : ok so, i go first.
3 : mm
1 : umm
1 : so i take up three actions
1 : i guess i will
3 : you may want to like
1 : shore up the adjacent tiles
1 : i guess
1 : number one
3 : yeah get whispering garden cause that's an important one
1 : then move to
1 : whispering garden
4 : yeah then you can shore up two again.
1 : yeah shore up two again.
1 : but can i do it more than once per turn? i for
1 : some, some of those were only like once per per turn.
3 : does yours
3 : does it say on it?
1 : no it just says two for one action so i can do it
1 : and then draw the
1 : draw two crea treasure cards
4 : two
1 : ok
3 : aw no
1 : i got the water's rise, so i have to do that.
2 : hmm.
3 : darn
1 : so
1 : move this one up one.
1 : shuffle this thing and put it back
1 : on top
1 : and then discard that.
3 : i can like
4 : and draw two of the
3 : oh yeah, ok
3 : yeah you do have the
4 : of the yeah
2 : of these ones? yeah.
1 : yes
1 : so lost lagoon and gold gate.
2 : oh there we go
3 : oh no it sunk
3 : shoot
2 : crushin it.
3 : oh wait this goes, yeah
4 : and then i need the umm
4 : the
2 : the gold gate one.
4 : yeah the gold gate one.
1 : oh yes.
3 : that's not even fair. we didn't even have a chance.
2 : didn't even have a chance. ok.
2 : ah my turn.
3 : yeah you're over there
2 : i'll probably just you can take up to three, so i'll probably just move one.
2 : and
2 : pick cards
4 : yeah
2 : unless you think i should do something else
1 : wait shouldn't you do
3 : wait do you want to like
3 : do you want to like start collecting his little
1 : what
1 : what's your special power again?
2 : i can only give cards to other people.
1 : ok.
2 : my special power is
1 : umm
3 : oh you can only give cards or?
2 : i can give cards and it
1 : what else can you do
3 : well if you moved to his island i guess
3 : you could like take the blue cup thing
3 : and you could start collecting those
2 : i can give treasure cards. not take.
3 : i guess you could
3 : no but if you're on the same island can't everyone give cards?
3 : or no?
1 : oh yeah i could, if you're on
3 : is that a rule?
1 : no, ah never mind.
3 : oh it's not a rule, ok never mind.
1 : i can't, you can't.
3 : yeah that
4 : i don't think there's anything you can really do, then.
2 : yeah so should i just pick the two?
3 : ok never mind
4 : yeah
3 : you can just move around
2 : and sandbags and then, two of these?
2 : phantom rock and cliffs of abandon
4 : by phantom rock. can i see that then?
2 : oh my god.
2 : yeah phantom rock.
4 : yeah
3 : it was just in the way it's fine.
2 : and cliffs of abandon.
3 : ok
2 : ok.
3 : oh
3 : i don't know
4 : if you move here, you can shore that one up.
2 : yeah.
3 : oh true
3 : ok
3 : i'll do that and then i'll shore
4 : yeah and then you don't have to do the third one if
4 : i don't
4 : know what you would do
3 : mmhmm
3 : umm
3 : yep
3 : i mean i can
3 : yeah, right ok
3 : oh another one, fun
3 : and then
3 : whispering garden and breaker's bridge.
1 : whispering garden
2 : right under it
4 : ok
4 : so
4 : i can move
4 : diagonally
4 : so i could move here.
4 : for one.
4 : shore up diagonally
4 : and then
4 : shore up
4 : adjacent.
3 : good call
2 : and then you get two.
4 : mmhmm.
4 : and then two flood cards.
4 : temple of the moon and iron gate.
4 : and then could you, thanks.
1 : umm not sure if there's anything i can do.
1 : much
4 : umm
1 : umm
2 : lost lagoon
1 : yeah i could move one then shore up the lost lagoon then
4 : umm
4 : or
4 : you could move two and then shore up temple of the moon since it's umm
4 : one of the eight
4 : ones.
3 : yheah
1 : yeah well but i could
2 : do that
3 : or i could move you somewhere if you want to go
1 : have we pulled, we haven't pulled temple of the moon yet have we? i don't think.
1 : did that start out flooded or did we already draw it?
3 : no it's right there, we drew it
4 : no we just did that one so if you had another flood card it could be coming up and then if we lose it
2 : it's right there we just drew it
1 : oh so but
4 : that's one of the two to get
4 : umm
4 : that
1 : i think they they're they're probably only in there once i think
1 : are they or are they are they repeated?
3 : yeah but if we get water's rise you have to put it on top.
4 : yeah but if we get a a water's rising
2 : yeah
1 : no but then you can
1 : do it next time for your first thing
1 : oh yeah but you but it back on af as soon as you do water's
1 : if you get the water's rise.
1 : yeah then you draw two more, yeah i should do that.
3 : mmhmm
1 : so one,
1 : two
1 : there we go
1 : then
1 : that's three move actions.
4 : that's three.
4 : yeah
1 : so two of those
1 : oh we did
2 : hmm.
1 : so
1 : put that away
1 : shuffle that
1 : yeah we don't really care about those two anyway, i guess.
1 : then draw three of these.
1 : ah that's a good idea.
2 : safe
1 : umm
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : where is that?
1 : and lost lagoon
2 : oh right here.
1 : lost lagoon sunk
4 : ok 
3 : oh you guys
3 : just keep the only the necesary tiles
3 : and then
2 : ok so my turn
2 : i'm gonna
2 : do that for one and then do cliffs of abandon for another
2 : umm
2 : should i get
2 : rid of card because
2 : umm aren't i gonna have to discard cause i already have four?
1 : yeah
3 : yeah but if you draw two you could like
4 : pick which one to discard then
3 : yeah i guess but i mean
1 : you can, yeah you can
1 : this
1 : ah i'm the only one who has one of these
2 : yeah
2 : i pick three though
2 : ok so
1 : you pick
2 : hmm
1 : you picked three?
3 : two
1 : yeah
2 : oh two? and then the water card is the ok
1 : yeah i know
3 : and then you have to discard one immediately.
2 : sandbags
3 : no
3 : i would keep, i don't know, i feel like you're about to get four of those so throw away one of the cups
4 : i would keep the sandbags
1 : that might be useful yeah.
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
4 : especially you're really close to the temple of the moon which is that so.
3 : oh yeah
3 : yeah
3 : bye
2 : and then three.
1 : maybe you could give her
1 : that
1 : one uh when it's your turn
4 : yeah yeah
1 : then you can
1 : get it on the next time
4 : i can do that
2 : then we just need one more. so
3 : i could fly you there
2 : and then i take three of the water.
1 : yes
2 : umm, breaker's bridge.
2 : iron gate and whispering garden.
4 : iron gate is done, we need the card for that.
3 : iron gate's gone.
1 : whispering garden.
2 : iron gate.
4 : ok
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : gosh i feel like i'm so useless in this game
3 : umm
4 : no you could
3 : i guess like yeah
4 : shore up this then move there and then shore up that one.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : and shore you up
3 : aqnd then that's probably it cause everything's good now so.
4 : that's yeah. that's three.
1 : it's three moves anyway.
3 : oh yeah, ok
1 : two of them
3 : so two of these
3 : ok so that makes five
3 : umm if you're gonna go for that then i'll just throw this away.
4 : ok
3 : and then
2 : but i have the
4 : i can give you one on my turn
2 : oh we need four? ok never mind then
3 : yeah cause she's going next anyways.
4 : yeah
3 : three of these
3 : copper gate
3 : crimson forest and howling garden
1 : copper gate.
4 : crimson forest. ok.
3 : you see crimson forest? yeah
4 : mm, so for my first move
2 : thanks
4 : at
4 : umm
4 : oh so well
1 : oh
3 : you have to be on the same tile.
1 : yeah one
2 : there we go awesome. thanks.
4 : there we go. one, two.
4 : and then i don't know should i shore up this? do you think it matters which one?
1 : well that one we can maybe walk through it more easily.
4 : yeah so.
2 : yeah.
1 : that might be more useful
4 : that one
4 : here we go
3 : really fast i'm just gonna use sandbags for this one cause
4 : that's
3 : cause i'm scared it's gonna like get flooded
4 : ok
1 : you can do that any time right?
3 : and you can do it at any time so, yeah.
4 : yeah
4 : cause it's a special action then i need two of the
4 : treasure cards.
4 : water rises.
4 : and then one of these, so discard that
1 : i can shuffle it for you
4 : yeah good call cause it's probably gonna come up.
3 : like every other card is water rises
2 : ok
2 : one, two, three, four
2 : don't i have to get rid of one? cause i have six?
1 : how many? three cards?
3 : oh have you had six?
2 : yeah i just realized i got six when she gave it to me. so crimson forest.
3 : oh my gosh
3 : yeah
4 : yeah.
4 : ok so
2 : sorry about that.
4 : umm whispering garden.
4 : crimson forest.
4 : and howling garden. ok.
4 : ugh
2 : got it.
4 : your turn engineer.
2 : go for it.
1 : umm
1 : so, take three actions. i guess i can shh i should shore some stuff up.
1 : umm
4 : yeah if
1 : whis
3 : wait are you guys all on the same tile?
4 : yeah we're all on the same tile
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : we're just chillin
3 : cause you could
4 : well if you moved here you could shh
3 : give her two of the little fire things and then she could eventually move
1 : yeah
2 : yeah give her the two fire things
4 : oh yeah
1 : how about i could do that?
3 : and i guess you could discard one of your little
1 : one, but then there's nothing else i can do except
1 : i can't shore anything up then
4 : so he could either
3 : you could move like one, two, oh i guess
1 : but then that's one
4 : yeah he could either give me one card
1 : 
4 : and then like move her and like shore this up or  two cards.
4 : and then put them but you wouldn't be able to shore it up
3 : i can put you some where, i have two of these it doesn't matter.
1 : can i
1 : pl
1 : give do an action and then you do that, then i do another action?
3 : yeah it says it can be used at any time.
1 : ok so i'll do that so
2 : ok
1 : two actions
3 : then you have to
3 : throw away one of these, yeah
4 : yeah
1 : then you move me
3 : you're on which one, do you care?
1 : th this one has the
1 : treasure
4 : uh
3 : yeah i mean i could just move these three to there
2 : straight to there and then shore it up. yeah.
1 : oh yeah.
4 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : ok.
3 : ok, yeah
4 : and then your third action would be shoring it up, ok.
1 : right.
3 : yay
2 : ok.
2 : umm.
2 : treasure time?
1 : so that's an action. so it's two actions now.
2 : yeah so that would be it.
1 : oh right.
3 : oh you didn't do flood cards.
1 : yeah, stupid
1 : so
4 : well you could also for your third one.
1 : i had, i had, i didn't
1 : do that. i had to draw it through the treasure. i forgot the cards.
2 : oh right.
3 : right.
2 : yeah 
3 : and the water.
2 : and the
1 : yeah of course.
2 : water thing.
1 : so this then three cards.
1 : it is
1 : yours, your move back. ok so.
1 : cliffs of abandon. temple of the moon.
1 : and copper gate.
2 : mm.
1 : so where's cliffs of abandon?
2 : did we?
4 : cliffs of abandon
4 : cliffs of abandon.
1 : ok.
2 : ok
3 : and we can still use those even if they're flipped so, you're still fine.
1 : right.
2 : yeah
1 : so
4 : and then once we get the treasure it's unimportant
3 : yay
2 : ok we're good.
1 : got it, yeah
1 : so one
3 : yay!
2 : treasure.
3 : then that's another, that's two actions.
1 : two
2 : and then
4 : so you could like shore it up if you wanted as the third
4 : or like shore one of
3 : oh you could shore up one of like this one.
1 : yeah.
4 : yeah
1 : what's your power?
2 : uh
2 : i can give cards
1 : oh yeah.
2 : to people.
2 : umm
4 : yes.
1 : you might as well shore one up.
4 : yeah, just, just shore.
2 : just shore up the one that i'm on. yeah.
4 : probably this one. yeah.
3 : mmhmm
2 : just to be safe.
2 : ok
1 : you discard those right?
2 : and then
2 : do i put them in the discard pile or do i just like
3 : i'm trying to see
1 : or do you throw them all the way out? i i forget
2 : so yeah it just says discard, so i guess it's discarded, ok.
3 : do you see it anywhere?
1 : yeah
3 : ok, yeah
2 : and, yeah
2 : and then i choose two
2 : and i got two of these
2 : and
2 : three of these.
2 : we have breaker's bridge, cave of embers and silver gate.
4 : ok
3 : cave of embers.
4 : and silver gate did you say?
2 : yeah silver gate.
4 : ok
3 : alright.
3 : i'm gonna start flipping stuff over then.
3 : so i'll use one action.
3 : umm
3 : and then i'll fly here as an action.
3 : and then flip this over just to have
3 : and that's my turn.
3 : and little statue, little dude.
3 : umm bronze gate, coral palace and dunes of deception.
3 : coral alace
3 : k
4 : ok
2 : shore up copper gate because on your turn you can give me the cup.
1 : ok.
2 : and then i could just get the treasure.
4 : ok so shore up copper gate.
4 : umm
2 : and i guess
1 : you want to
1 : you can't get that
1 : oh does someone have
1 : can i use my helicopter thing to move you?
3 : yeah you can use it whenever
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : ok i'll
1 : give use a helicopter
4 : ok
2 : no
1 : to move you
1 : to, do you want to go to this one or this one?
4 : if you move me to pilot's landing i can shore up both of these cause my special thing is shoring up diagonally.
3 : no but don't you want to like
3 : get rid of those?
4 : oh yeah that's true too.
1 : you want to move there or there to get
2 : no
1 : the
4 : yeah
1 : the treasure for your second action.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah so if i
3 : yeah maybe this one cause it's more central
1 : then you can
1 : move here and shore up this one for your third action? ok.
4 : yeah.
4 : let's do that. so
2 : ok.
3 : yeah.
2 : move here.
4 : move there.
2 : shore up this one.
1 :  two through three.
4 : and then
2 : discard pile. sweet.
1 : yes.
4 : so that's three and then two
3 : nice.
3 : nice!
4 : treasure cards
2 : sorry
4 : and then three flood
2 : and three of these, umm
2 : tidal pla
2 : palace,
4 : ok.
2 : temple of the sun
2 : and
2 : misty marsh.
4 : misty marsh is
2 : oh this one right here?
4 : ok
1 : i should
2 : ok.
1 : shore up some stuff on this turn.
3 : wait where are you? you're over there right?
2 : yeah.
1 : yes.
4 : yeah he's here.
3 : ok.
3 : umm
3 : if i give you these two like if i fly
3 : myself over with this and give you these two then you can
1 : but you can't that that has to be on your turn
2 : we only need, we only need three treasures right?
3 : get the yellows
3 : we'll yeah.
2 : umm because i have three of these so if he gives me the cup then i can just go to tidal palace and we could be done.
3 : no this can be any turn
1 : oh yes.
3 : ok.
1 : which color are you?
1 : but we have to have an other helicopter lift to escape.
3 : true, ok.
3 : yeah ok, so go do that.
2 : so yeah.
2 : so
2 : give me the cup
1 : one
4 : wait don't you have to be on the same tile as to give
2 : oh right. same tile. i keep forgetting that. ok so then move to me for three. we could do that.
3 : yeah
1 : oh right, right.
1 : never mind. yeah.
4 : so
1 : but then i couldn't shore up anything. that could be dangerous.
4 : ok. so for you to be able to move
3 : you can
4 : umm
4 : i think we need to shore up this because if this gets sunk then you're kind of
4 : then you can only move here and like
4 : you know what i mean?
2 : yeah.
3 : oh yeah you could do two at a time right?
1 : yeah. i can shore up all
1 : like
1 : move here, shore up these two.
4 : you can yes.
3 : can't do diagonal though.
3 : that's diagonal you can't do that.
1 : no like move and then shore up is two actions.
3 : oh the
3 : oh those two, ok yeah.
4 : yeah so if you moved here and then shored up these two that would give her like a path down that we wouldn't have to worry about them like getting flooded and her getting stuck.
3 : ok yeah do that. that's a good call.
1 : yeah.
1 : then
1 : i can't give it to you though.
1 : oh well.
4 : yeah but.
4 : i mean she'd have to make it all the way down there anyways.
4 : so it's possible that like
2 : yeah, i could just do straight down
4 : yeah
1 : yeah well i'll i'll definitely do that so that's my one
3 : yeah but that's part of
3 : yeah we could just hold off
4 : one
3 : like
4 : and that's two.
1 : is there a third move i can do?
3 : if you want to like
3 : move next to her, i don't know like
3 : or like go to misty marsh
3 : or 
1 : where might i want to move next?
1 : umm i have these cards that might be if i
1 : might want to stay close to the whispering garden in case i can get four somehow.
4 : yeah.
4 : yeah i think that's like a good like central spot to stay.
2 : yeah just stay there.
1 : ok i'll just stop and stay here and then pick those cards.
3 : yeah you could just stop if you want yeah.
2 : yeah you don't have to do all three.
2 : and water's rise and helicopter.
1 : water's of course.
2 : got one
3 : oh good we have the two helicopters.
1 : oh that goes in that treasure discard.
2 : oh
1 : yeah
2 : ok umm
1 : wait i have to draw the card these cards first.
3 : oh
1 : the
2 : oh you're shuffling them?
1 : draw the flood shuffle, put it back, and draw the flood cards.
3 : right right.
1 : still three.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : uh crimson forest.
1 : that one's gone.
4 : ok i need the card for it.
1 : howling garden.
1 : and misty marsh.
4 : yeah so good thing we did that otherwise it would've sunk and you had been like stuck.
2 : ok
1 : yeah.
1 : that's it.
1 : so
2 : yeah and i'm just gonna move
1 : is it
1 : your third action you can shore something up?
2 : umm
1 : misty marsh i don't
2 : i'll just, i'll just do misty marsh again whatever.
3 : just why not like
3 : it's been good to us.
2 : it's been
2 : uh
1 : oh you got it
2 : oh sweet.
2 : even better.
3 : oh nice
2 : umm and then i take three.
2 : and we temple of the moon.
2 : umm
2 : copper gate.
2 : and whispering garden.
4 : copper gate
2 : ok yeah
4 : ok
3 : uh
3 : i'll flip you over
1 : you know maybe
1 : since, if you can
1 : get this card on your next turn should everyone else move towards the fool's landing?
4 :  yeah.
2 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
3 : right.
4 : that's a good idea.
2 : yeah.
3 : i'll fly me here then.
3 : and i guess that's it.
3 : ok.
4 : alrighty so
3 : umm i'll throw this away, and then
3 : that's too many cards so, why not.
2 : and then three of these.
2 : uh cliffs of abandon
2 : uh cave of embers and
2 : silver gate.
3 : cave of embers is gone.
4 : and so is silver gate.
4 : ok
4 : so
1 : well it's your turn now?
4 : yeah.
4 : it's my turn.
1 : whi which one color are you gonna?
4 : i'm green
4 : so i could move here
1 : you
1 : move here, shore up that one, then move to fool's landing maybe?
4 : shore up
4 : shore up that? yeah.
3 : ooh that one sucked
4 : ok
2 : and two
4 : and then yeah, two treasure cards.
1 : three of these
4 : and three flood.
4 : bronze gate
4 : coral palace
2 : hmm.
4 : and then dunes of deception.
3 : ok i'm gonna use sandbags and put this one back just in case.
4 : ok can you t
4 : eh, sorry.
2 : just to be safe
1 : ok
2 : ok.
1 : umm
1 : i have three moves
1 : i guess two moving there, why not shore up this one
4 : yeah
3 : sure
1 : one, two, three.
4 : just in case that somehow sinks
2 : ok.
3 : all up to you, messenger
2 : oh, right
2 : we gotta do the
1 : right.
1 : uh oh, waters rise.
2 : great!
3 : wel'l
1 : i have to draw four
3 : we'll be ok.
2 : i feel like
1 : how i hope
3 : no we'll be fine.
2 : and the the yeah.
3 : cause it won't be fool's landing cause we haven't gotten that one yet.
2 : yeah.
1 : ok that's it.
1 : then draw four.
1 : misty marsh
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : where's that one?
1 : howling garden
1 : and temple of the moon.
2 : you got it?
1 : no temple of the
1 : moon, where is that one?
2 : 
1 : that one.
2 : ok

4 : ok
3 : c'mon you got this
3 : one
1 : four
3 : one
2 : what is that?
3 : two
3 : and then move yay
3 : then you gotta do that
1 : wait but we can play the helicopter lift at any time so i guess i can play it now to end the game.
2 : yeah just
3 : sure
4 : yeah
2 : do that.
1 : yeah.
2 : we done, let's go
3 : go for it.
1 : yes.
3 : yay team!
3 : done.
