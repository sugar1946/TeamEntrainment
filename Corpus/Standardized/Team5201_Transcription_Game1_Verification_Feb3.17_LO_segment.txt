4 : here goes
3 : thank you
1 : ok it's my turn i can take up to three actions
1 : so i'm gonna move here
1 : and then shore up
1 : breaker's bridge and
1 : cliffs of abandon.
4 : no you have one more turn
1 : and i have one more turn
1 : i could also shore up whispering garden.
4 : and you gotta draw. draw two and
1 : and then i have to draw
4 : two treasure cards and two flood decks
2 : uhum do you want me to give you two?
1 : two treasure cards and then two flood
1 : thank you
1 : i got a water's rise card
4 : ah
1 : and maybe like
2 : sorry
1 : it's not your fault.
1 : ok so we
1 : shuffle these and put em on top?
1 : correct?
2 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
4 : and then discard the card
1 : to the treasure tile and then do i i still have to take two of these?
4 : you still have to take mmhmm
1 : 
1 : i got cliffs of abandon and phantom rock,
1 : so
1 : the one i just shored up.
1 : where's phantom rock?
4 : oh it just sunk
1 : ah beautiful
4 : oh t uh no you just need this one, the phantom rocks card. the other one goes
1 : phantom rock
2 : mm
4 : in there.
1 : ok
4 : ok
1 : k
2 : ok so umm
2 : i guess i'll
2 : one move
2 : shore up this one
2 : umm
2 : and
2 : would either of you want
2 : to start building up
4 : uh
4 : no, i don't know, it's up to you.
2 : umm
3 : you don't have to take three actions
4 : yeah
2 : ok, uh
4 : and you can move yourself again if you want
2 : yeah
4 : like you could move yourself here if you wanted to
2 : ok, i guess i'll just hang out there then
1 : k
2 : ok
2 : uh
2 : that's
2 : 
2 : yeah
2 : uh breaker's bridge and whispering garden
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : i
3 : guess
3 : i will
3 : go
3 : here
3 : cause i can fly
3 : umm
3 : and shore this up
3 : mm
4 : and then you can either
1 : that's bothering me
4 : do another move or you can just let that end
4 : and draw your cards.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : i
3 : umm yeah, i'm going to
3 : draw my treasure cards
3 : which were here
3 : ok
3 : and
3 : flood
3 : cards too.
1 : let go
3 : thank you
1 : yes
3 : lost lagoon and gold gate. hmm lucky
3 : ok
1 : this is gone
4 : damn
1 : i was gonna shore that up, dang it
3 : uh
3 : 
4 : ok, umm
4 : ok so
4 : i would
4 : i'm gonna move here
4 : and
4 : give this to you
2 : thank you
4 : which is
4 : right, right? i can do that because we're both on the same card
3 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok
1 : you can.
2 : so that's like two moves, i think then
4 : yeah, so if i have one more if i want to but i don't really feel like doing anything so i'll take two of those
3 : mmhmm
4 : thank you
2 : mmhmm
4 : and two of those.
4 : thank you
4 : oh ho ho, ok
4 : temple of the moon just got
4 : flooded.
1 : and then what was iron gate?
4 : iron gate
4 : didn't that already just happen?
3 : right here
1 : mm silver gate, there's iron gate.
4 : there we go
1 : oh there's a gold gate
4 : that's it, i'm done.
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : i don't know what i want, i'm gonna
1 : shore up where i'm standing on
1 : and then shore this up so that's two moves.
4 : oh no can't you shore up two up for one action?
1 : yeah, but it has to be like two that are adjacent to me isn't it?
4 : umm
3 : the engineer may shore up two tiles for one action
4 : just two tiles per an action so
3 : the explorer may also shore up tiles diagonally. you can do like, do do
1 : oh well then it is one action
3 : do
3 : do
1 : mmhmm
1 : ok
3 : and this because
1 : and it's all i wanna do
2 : do you would it maybe be worth if you were to like move up here as a second move and then shore up that one as a third?
1 : ooo yeah
1 : second move,
1 : third
1 : k
1 : no
2 : oh
4 : oh
4 : you ca
1 : you're the only one that can do it diagonally
4 : i can only move diagonally oh yeah, i can shore up diagonally
2 : ah
1 : yeah you can do both. ok so i'll just stand th i'll hang out.
1 : can i have two of the
1 : i got a water's rise card
4 : ah
1 : but i also got that
4 : that one's gonna for sure up temple of the moon soon especially cause we're just shuffling it
1 : alright
1 : but then the
1 : i'm not very good at shuffling
1 : and then draw three now
1 : so i got temple of the moon, which you guys are on, whispering garden, and iron gate
1 : so iron gate has sunk also
3 : oh yeah
1 : and whispering garden is now back to that
3 : umm so now you can
1 : so temple of the moon
3 : move to anything right
4 : so we can move
3 : left, uh up, down
4 : yeah
4 : so
4 : us two have to move immediately.
1 : do you wait, do move
1 : on the your turn, or just immediately?
4 : just immediately i think to get out of swimming
1 : k
3 : yeah
1 : yes
4 : cause it's not an action, we just have to
1 : oh yeah, it is an action is it?
4 : be on land.
4 : umm
4 : you cool if we both do both of us, both of us here?
2 : i think so, yeah
4 : ok, your turn
2 : ok, umm, hmm hmm hmm hmm,
2 : i guess
2 : maybe i'll start moving forward in the hopes of going here.
4 : mmhmm
3 : umm
1 : how many do you wanna move one or
2 : one
3 : or you can also move to whispering garden and then
4 : you can move
2 : and shore it up
3 : on yeah
2 : yeah cause
2 : ok, so that's three
2 : umm
2 : alright now i need
2 : to discard one of these
4 : what'd you get?
3 : umm
2 : these two
2 : uh this was actually the most recent one so i guess i get rid of that
3 : oh wait, but don't you wanna keep that cause yeah then you have four
4 : well keep that, cause then you have four.
2 : or
2 : is it, is it, is it, i guess it's a is it a choice though? cause it's ok
4 : yeah,
4 : like you have five cards in your hand you can discard any one of them that you want.
3 : like you can give that
2 : ok
2 : cool
2 : one
2 : two uh
1 : yes or no
1 : only have five. how many do you have right now?
1 : oh you have six
2 : umm, oh i do, that's
3 : your treasure and your special action
2 : never mind
4 : well no you can still keep that, yeah
1 : don't give her that one, you can
1 : get rid of like the chalice or like the sandbags
2 : yeah, that's a good point ok, i gotcha
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : i keep thinking it's like
2 : chronologically which one's i got
2 : ok uh cliffs of abandon,
2 : breaker's bridge, and gold gate.
3 : no
1 : no
4 : no
2 : mm
3 : uh
1 : hey this is not going well
3 : i don't know if there's any strategy to this but
1 : ok, it's your turn now
3 : it is my turn, alright
3 : umm
1 : you could
4 : ooo you should lift him
1 : as a suggestion you could fly him
3 : i
4 : yeah
1 : to you.
3 : how does that exist?
4 : you could
3 : once  fly oh just saying this, ok
1 : oh wait, and you have, it's
4 : no yeah, you have to use a helicopter lift and you can
1 : helicopter lift
4 : well wait can you lift anyone?
3 : lift your teams off
1 : helicopter lift is required to leave the island.
3 : move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile.
3 : so yeah, i can just lift him over there but i can't lift anyone else or myself.
4 : yeah that's because there's no one else on the
3 : and then
4 : card.
3 : and also that doesn't even count as an action so
1 : use
1 : gray not green.
4 : yeah so you can
3 : ok so you're what color are you?
1 : gray
4 : gray
3 : gray
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok so i
3 : will
3 : put you
4 : she'll have to just wait till this turn to do that
3 : put you
1 : we'll just have to make sure to keep
3 : there
1 : that safe.
3 : and
3 : i still have three more actions.
3 : umm i can
1 : oh yeah we don't have any other
4 : oh you're gotta just
3 : i can go here
3 : and
1 : shore up
3 : also shore it up
3 : so that's only two actions
2 : mmhmm
3 : and umm
1 : you have to get rid of your helicopter lift card
4 : yeah
3 : yes
3 : uh
3 : i don't think
3 : i could fly to another tile but i don't know what the purpose would be. ok yeah i'm just gonna
4 : you don't have to if you don't feel like doing anything else.
3 : chill there and now
2 : and then
3 : draw
3 : three of these.
1 : do your treasure cards first.
3 : the treasure cards first, is what i meant.
4 : mmhmm
2 : i, i also think there's a limit that you can only fly once per
1 : there's three, you're supposed to only do two.
3 : once per
2 : i think
1 : you have three, or were we supposed to pick two?
4 : two
3 : so sorry
3 : ok
3 : treasures
1 : oh
3 : umm
4 : keep it fine
4 : and then two three of your
3 : right
2 : i can
3 : oh
3 : if you
3 : y
3 : nn
1 : oh i should probably
3 : thank you
3 : copper gate,
3 : crimson forest,
3 : howling garden.
1 : nn, mm, mm, i didn't know where it was.
4 : oh thank god
1 : k
3 : ok
4 : ok, so umm i was thinking
4 : that
4 : i would
4 : hmm.
3 : i think it's important to make sure we keep shoring up, especially places where there's like, where we need to get the treasure from
1 : get a civil card
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : umm
3 : which aren't any of these specifically but like that one you're not anywhere near that one, but umm
4 : mmhmm
4 : and also also i was thinking, she
4 : you already have
4 : two of those.
1 : mmhmm
4 : but we're very far from those cards
1 : yeah
3 : i have two as well
4 : because i have to move away from i have to like land on you to give you the card anyways
3 : i have two as well so
1 : i mean i could just slowly move that way
3 : but you're the mess
4 : you're
3 : wait
3 : you're the messenger? no
4 : i'm the explorer
3 : who's the messenger?
1 : i think maybe
3 : you're the messenger.
2 : i'm the messenger, yeah
4 : and you're pilot right, so
3 : give treasure cards to player anywhere on the island for one action per
1 : yeah you should probably give it to her cause she can fly wherever she wants to.
4 : yeah, there we go
1 : and then i'll give one to her next turn.
4 : so if i can move
4 : well i can move this way
4 : i can give you this card. that doesn't take an ap action right? giving you the card
1 : yes it does
4 : it does?
3 : well, i mean, technically you don't even need to give me that
2 : i think
3 : well
1 : yeah because
1 : we should go it too cause you can fly anywhere
3 : i mean because we need four.
1 : yeah and then i'll give you
3 : you have two already
1 : i'll give you one next card,
4 : mmhmm. she can use two turns to get to you too. she has to be on the same card as you, so like
1 : next turn.
3 : ok
1 : i'll just do a pair and give it to you
3 : but now i have to discard a card
4 : i did that
1 : oh
4 : yeah but you can discard, you can discard one of these if you wanted since
1 : yeah so it's
1 : none of us really have that many
3 : so go two
4 : yeah none of us have that anyways.
3 : so
3 : i'll do this.
1 : so you should probably do the air one since you already have two in next.
2 : nnhmm
4 : mmhmm
4 : eh
1 : if we
1 : get any.
4 : i shored that. so that was three actions right? i moved one, i gave her a card, i shored up a card.
3 : yeah
1 : yes
4 : awesome.
4 : i'll take two of those
1 : we're done.
4 : water's rise
1 : hmm yay
4 : ok, water's rise
1 : legendary
4 : i mean you can shuffle em up and put em on top.
1 : i guess
4 : and then i discard this
1 : what was the next one you have with the  one?
4 : i just got a thing but no one needs it anyway.
1 : he already has that so we can
2 : mmhmm three
4 : and then three flood cards, oh god
4 : whispering gardens,
4 : howling gardens,
3 : oh
1 : aw
4 : and breaker's bridge.
4 : here
1 : here it is
4 : we are sinking faster than atlantis
3 : ok we definitely need to get the whispering garden one because it's the only one we have left with that
1 : we really need to protect these two, the only two left
4 : mmhmm
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok
4 : ok, you're turn
1 : my turn
1 : i'm going to
1 : move here,
4 : you
1 : yes
3 : or
1 : no
3 : don't you wanna
4 : you gotta take two turns to go there cause you can't can you move diagonally?
1 : i can't move diagonally, i cannot
3 : but
4 : so yeah you can take turns, you can go one, two if you wanted
3 : well don't you,
3 : don't you wanna maybe shore up the whispering garden one?
1 : i wanna give you a card though.
3 : umm ok
4 : well can't you shore up a uh you can shore up oh two tiles never mind, i don't know what i'm talking about.
1 : mmhmm and it doesnt count as
2 : umm i think, i think it might be more important to shore it up first and then
3 : to shore up, yeah because if it's gone, then it's gone.
1 : ok i'll shore up and then i'll just move there. don't move.
3 : ok
1 : that's me, ok, good.
1 : two of those
1 : please
1 : k i got
1 : this guy and helicopter lift so i have to get rid of. i have one, two, three, four
3 : get rid of the chalice
3 : is that what that is?
1 : chalice. so i have five now.
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : here you go
4 : and then three forbidden island cards
1 : then
4 : ooo fingers crossed.
3 : the only thing that we'll lose is crimson forest, yup.
1 : guys i feel like crimson forest is yeah crimson forest is gone.
1 : that was also copper gate, oh my god
1 : and cliffs of abandon.
4 : oh we're all standing on it.
1 : ah
1 : we need to shore that up soon.
3 : yeah especially because it's close to fool's landing.
4 : ok, messenger.
2 : ok so my first move is to cash these in.
4 : does that count?
2 : uh i think that's one move.
1 : yeah it is.
4 : yeah
3 : and you if you discard four
4 : mmhmm it is.
2 : uh discard cards to the treasure card discard pile and move the  in front of you, so i'll take that.
3 : 
2 : umm
2 : front of you, so i'll take that.
4 : ok, so that's one action of yours
2 : yeah, is there any other
4 : umm
4 : you c
4 : oh
4 : wait
4 : oh never mind. for some reason i thought fool's landing was already gone. i was like hold on
2 : i
1 : wait, is sandbags count as a move?
4 : what?
1 : it doesn't right?
4 : no, it's a special card so
3 : umm
1 : you could use it on cliffs of abandon
3 : technically we don't even really have to worry about
1 : since we're all there.
3 : like
3 : kee keeping that, like shoring that up again if it's not anywhere near fool's landing and we already have the
2 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, i might wanna hold on to this just in case one of the other ones uh gets in trouble, so maybe that's it?
1 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : but, do you, do you have to be on
4 : mmhmm
3 : on the
4 : temple side? no he can move somewhere if he wants to.
3 : i mean
2 : yeah, i mean maybe i'll go up two and
1 : hang out with us
2 : yeah, we'll
3 : uh
3 : mm
2 : uh
3 : oh darn it. ok
3 : never mind, just kidding.
2 : ok
1 : oh
2 : uh, cave of embers,
3 : so
2 : silver gate,
2 : and dunes of deception.
1 : ok
1 : silver gate and dunes of t-deception.
3 : hmm dunes of deception.
4 : ok, your turn.
3 : ok
4 : hopefully water rise doesn't i say you should shore up on cliffs of abandon anyways, because if we get a water's if you draw a water's rise card it'll go back right into the shuffle.
3 : i think
3 : yeah
3 : umm
3 : also i was thinking maybe it would be pretty important to fly here and then also shore that up because it's the only
3 : no there's only two of those
3 : yeah, maybe shore that up.
4 : well that would be three moves if you shored this, flied here, and then shored that.
3 : yeah, i'll take that.
1 : yeah and then
1 : i think for my move, so i can give you th-things
2 : uh
4 : oh no, you have to stand on the same thing
3 : well are you gonna s
2 : umm could you exchange a card, umm dis
3 : i don't
1 : i think it has to be my turn
3 : i think it has to be her turn to give it to me and then
2 : ok that's
1 : so i think for my turn, like i know that your turn's next but i think i might go here and then shore these up and then oh wait no, that'd be three wouldn't it?
4 : or no how bout this. if she shored this and then
3 : came here and then shored this up, waited here for her
1 : yes
4 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : and then i'll just come here,
1 : come over and give it to you.
4 : and then you can give the card, and then she'll just have to wait another round.
4 : only like one more turn before she
3 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : ok cool
3 : volunteer
1 : shorin it up
3 : woohoo
3 : uh
3 : and now draw two treasure decks right?
1 : mm
3 : umm
1 : thank god
3 : i think i'm just gonna discard both of these
3 : wait cause
4 : well you can keep one
3 : no i already have five
4 : oh
4 : there we go.
1 : yeah just cause
1 : discard
3 : umm and then three of those
1 : 
3 : and
3 : tidal palace is
3 : is right here
4 : oh
3 : and bronze gate
3 : which way
3 : it's right here
3 : and coral palace.
3 : this guy
3 : umm
3 : technically speaking i think uh if we just let this guy go as long as we keep that one
3 : so that on your turn maybe shore that up
2 : sure
3 : and if that goes away it's uh
3 : it's ok cause we already have another place to
1 : mmhmm
3 : cushion that.
3 : umm 
4 : moves
1 : yeah and plus
4 : ok, we're already making moves to get
4 : the fire stone right?
1 : yeah
3 : right, and i think
4 : then we needa make
3 : so we're gonna make, we're gonna try to get this and then this will be our next goal.
1 : moves to get this.
4 : mmhmm
3 : ok
4 : uh, what color are you, red?
1 : i'm red.
4 : ok
4 : you wanna give me one or should i give you one?
4 : how's this gonna work?
1 : i can't give you one right now
3 : umm
1 : and if i
4 : well if i give you one
1 : if i
3 : i just need one more
4 : yeah you can get rid of one
1 : ok yeah
1 : oh you know on your turn you can give me that
1 : oh i have to get i'll give her a helicopter lift though
1 : you only need one more fire?
4 : yeah, so you can get rid of one fire. keep the helicopter lift just in case
3 : yeah i need one more fire
1 : yeah, here
3 : yeah
4 : umm
4 : so that's one turn.
1 : ok
4 : and then
3 : your next turns need to be to go to where i am
3 : right?
1 : mm me, i need to
4 : no i don't need to. she needs to
3 : no
3 : you yeah, right.
2 : umm you
2 : uh you can also, you can give a second card as a second move if we wanted to load up on
4 : mmhmm
4 : but then she'd have to move away from that.
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 :  from her.
4 : oh but if you did then you could use a helicopter lift
1 : you could
4 : to get to her because she already has she's already saving a helicopter lift.
3 : but how many
1 : ha ha
4 : we only need one to get to fool's landing, and all we're close to fool's landing as it is.
1 : yeah so
1 : she give it to me
1 : that would be two turns for you and then i would
1 : go here
3 : umm
1 : that would be all one turn
3 : should
4 : but you have to get rid of a card. we can't do that. never mind.
1 : and then
3 : just
1 : k
3 : very quickly, umm
1 : no it's good.
3 : we might wanna, wait, ok we actually don't care about this one right? we just wanna get cause we only need three treasures.
4 : yeah
1 : shore this up.
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok so if
3 : any of those go it's alright we can like figure it out
1 : so you have
4 : you know what, i can move and or shore up diagonally.
3 : alright
1 : you could shore up
1 : poral
1 : coral palace, not poral calace
3 : well, technically we don't really need to worry about any of these that are
1 : on the outside?
3 : what they are right now, because we can still get to fool's landing
1 : we just wanna keep fool's landing safe
3 : and also
4 : no but we should shore up this because it's next to fool's landing and if
1 : yeah
4 : if you're here
3 : right, but we can always use a helicopter she has one and i have one, as long as we have
3 : one to get us all out.
1 : one left
1 : we should still shore up though
1 : like
3 : maybe yeah.
4 : mmhmm
4 : well i mean that's one turn for me
1 : cause that's one
1 : thing for you.
4 : and then
3 : wait, aren't you green?
4 : i am but i can shore anything diagonally or around me.
1 : she's right the
3 : oh ok
1 : adjacently.
4 : umm
3 : so that's one move.
1 : everyone can shore up adjacently.
3 : ok
4 : yeah, i can i'm the only one who can shore up diagonally. and then i have one more turn.
4 : so
4 : we are not doing this thing where i'm moving here?
4 : you're moving here?
1 : uh
3 : cause she still
1 : i'll go
1 : uh cause if i, if i move here and then i fly here
1 : wait no
4 : if ok if i move here
1 : yeah if i move here and then isn't
4 : and then you also move there
1 : but i have to cap i move there, and then i have to capture a treasure.
4 : but you don't even have the card yet cause i can't give it to you
4 : cause
1 : i know
4 : we're just gonna wait till the next round for that whole plan to work.
1 : yes
4 : until you get rid of that fire card.
1 : ok, i'll just i have to give her this.
4 : yeah, so then i think i'm done.
3 : ok
4 : and i'm just gonna take
4 : two of those
4 : i betcha there's a water oh thank god
1 : oh no what time did we start?
4 : ok
4 : and then three of these.
1 : mm
4 : watchtower,
4 : misty marsh,
4 : temple of the sun.
1 : oh
1 : those are fine to
1 : have happen.
3 : yeah
4 : ok, your turn.
1 : ok so i'm going to
1 : should i helicopter lift to her or should i just
1 : does helicopter lift card count as a move?
4 : no
3 : i would say maybe save that oh ok
2 : mm
2 : mm
1 : i'm gonna save it, yeah
3 : we could test do you really need it if you just go one move and then one move
4 : and then give her the card
3 : and then give the card that's three.
1 : yeah ok wait
3 : yes
1 : so
3 : so do you get to 
1 : one,
3 : two
1 : two, that's two moves.
1 : here you go.
3 : and then three, thank you. and then i'll dispose of
3 : this
4 : yeah, you can dispose of that cause i have one
1 : dispose of it, she has one.
3 : ok
3 : ok
1 : ok and t-can i have two
1 : oh wait,
1 : is it your turn? it's my turn.
4 : yeah
1 : k
4 : ha ha
4 : ha ha
4 : shuffle well.
1 : at least i got two of those now
4 : shuffle well
1 : i will hey wait where does this go? it goes there.
1 : 
1 : there it is.
1 : now the stuff that's flooded now is real important but i also don't wanna sink anything.
4 : same
1 : come on
1 : ok
1 : i got cave of embers,
1 : which we're standing on
4 : but it'll be fixed soon enough.
1 : coral palace, and tidal palace. tidal palace is gone.
3 : and that's ok.
4 : that does not matter.
4 : ok
2 : ok, so i think, umm
2 : i should probably move
2 : over
2 : up
2 : and shore up?
2 : maybe.
4 : yeah
4 : you could
1 : yeah
1 : that's a good idea.
3 : mm
4 : yeah
4 : and then you're still close to fool's landing.
1 : just stay here because
2 : yeah
1 : that'd be
2 : one, two,
3 : ok
1 : done
3 : that's good
2 : alright
2 : uh breaker's bridge
1 : where is that?
2 : oh, maybe that's already sunk.
1 : it's already sunk, oh whoops.
4 : oh no then why is the card still in there?
1 : just take it
4 : oh well
4 : 
2 : uh dunes of deception is now gone
4 : i think you draw a card another one anyways then
1 : beautiful.
2 : and bronze gate
1 : bronze gate is gone.
3 : hmm
3 : ok
2 : is also gone.
1 : oh my home is gone.
4 : do you still have to draw another card because the one card that you drew was already gone?
3 : uh
1 : probably
4 : another flood card
3 : i don't know about that.
4 : what do you mean that was like a scrub of ours in the first place so
3 : i, i don't know if that's actually in the
1 : yes
1 : yes draw another card ok yes, she said draw another card.
4 : yeah
1 : here
3 : ok
2 : copper gate.
3 : ok, that's also ok.
4 : and that's gone as well.
4 : ok
4 : your turn.
4 : go, go, go.
4 : capture
3 : ok so
3 : i'm already there.
3 : so i guess i can turn these in
3 : and
3 : do i put em in here or do i put em in here?
4 : no you put em in there
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok so we have this and that counts as one
4 : mmhmm
3 : move right?
2 : mmhmm
3 : and so i guess i can fly
3 : here and move it
3 : 
1 : shore it
3 : unless you wanna do that one?
4 : do that one because
3 : just in case
4 : yeah because i have this
4 : just in case this doesn't work out.
3 : ok
3 : so one,
2 : mmhmm
1 : yeah you could give it to that
1 : him
3 : two,
3 : three.
4 : mmhmm
1 : ooo wait you're
3 : huh
3 : huh
1 : nothing, i'm talking to myself, i'm sorry.
3 : and then so draw two of these
3 : sandbags.
3 : 
3 : umm
3 : do you wanna shore anything up at this time?
4 : mm
1 : not really
3 : i don't think any of these things are radically important.
1 : maybe watchtower
3 : umm
4 : if you really want to. nah
1 : but not really.
1 : yeah, not really.
4 : ok so then three
3 : well
3 : ok.
3 : and
3 : yeah
4 : oh well at least we know that, what's it called?
4 : fool's landing isn't gonna come anytime soon because it's at the bottom of the deck.
3 : yeah
3 : ok misty marsh, that's gone.
1 : thank god
3 : the temple of the sun is
3 : gone.
4 : do i need that? no
3 : and
3 : watchtower is gone.
3 : ok
3 : wait, those were all gone? wow.
3 : ok
4 : ok then, umm
1 : alright
4 : i'm going
4 : oh i have to be next to you
4 : to give you this card.
1 : i mean you could just move
4 : yeah
1 : one, two and then give it to me.
1 : thank you
1 : and then i'll get rid of my helicopter lift because i already have two of em.
4 : oh and then i have to draw two cards.

4 : silver gate,
4 : gone
1 : mmhmm

2 : was that i think that one we just needed to flip.
1 : no, that wasn't flipped.
3 : that wasn't, that was
4 : or cliffs
3 : yeah
4 : oh that was flipped oh thank god, cause then we would be no way to get to that.
3 : 
1 : you could get to it.
4 : oh
3 : you could fly
4 : yeah, there you go.
1 : but i need to get to it.
3 : but
4 : ok
4 : your turn.
1 : ok so
4 : this?
3 : yeah, because it was just uh
4 : oh, right, right, right, cause i just flipped it over.
1 : oh yeah
1 : ah
1 : ok so i'm gonna this doesn't count as a move?
1 : yes, no?
4 : it
4 : doesn't.
3 : it does
4 : it doesn't but i think you should just use
3 : not count as an action.
1 : does not count as an action
4 : i think if you did one two
4 : oh no you have to get to here
1 : i can get to here
3 : umm
1 : using this
4 : no you'd only get to here oh no, using the helicopter lift, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : i can fly where ever the heck i want
1 : yeah
1 : k, that's gone
1 : i will
3 : that's so that's not a move?
1 : that's not a move. so this is
3 : ok so you can also flip
3 : the cliffs of
1 : yeah that's what i was gonna do.
3 : of abandon. ok, awesome.
1 : ok
2 : umm
1 : yes
2 : let's see so ok oh if you that's one move is to get the treasure. umm if you wanted to could you just hop one, two and then you're even closer.
3 : mmhmm
1 : umm
4 : to fool's landing?
3 : well
3 : i mean
4 : rather than shoring this up
1 : rather than shoring it up
3 : but don't
2 : because in
1 : cause if that sinks, then i mean, we already did this.
4 : it doesn't matter, yeah, you're already out of just get close to

3 : don't you still have to draw four?
1 : yeah, after i shuffle all of them i'm gonna draw four.
3 : and
3 : we shuffled four and we have to draw four, it doesn't even matter to shuffle.

3 : hop on that fool's landing guys, pretty soon.
4 : just hop to it
1 : you need to
1 : to him
4 : and i can, yeah
2 : ok, so i'm just gonna do that. umm
3 : s
3 : umm

1 : coral palace
3 : do
3 : do you wanna maybe try saving this one so
3 : she can get over
1 : why shh

2 : that's right, yes,
2 : my colors.
1 : you can, you can flip it right now.
4 : and plus it doesn't matter because

3 : ok
3 : that's good.
2 : by that
4 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : ok
4 : and plus we don't need to wory about the
4 : ocean's chalice cause we already have three.
3 : yeah
3 : and we just need to make sure to have one helicopter lift
1 : oh but if this sinks
1 : that's not good.
4 : well he can move
1 : can you shore that up still? you already did, you only did one
1 : two things.
3 : well, actually if this sinks then you get to move like
1 : yeah but
3 : then you swim to the
1 : oh we already have three, never mind.
3 : nearest
2 : umm ok, so there's only three to draw from here
4 : what do we do if there's only three cards? do you just draw those three?
1 : yeah
1 : shuffle it.
4 : oh
2 : ok
1 : shuffle your two cards.
4 : and then draw four.
2 : ok
2 : underneath underneath? ok.

4 : well we can still fly out of here if it's not sunk
2 : umm twilight hollow
2 : and cave of shadows.
