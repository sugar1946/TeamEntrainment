3 : i'm gonna use my special flying powers one to move, two to turn that
3 : umm
3 : i think that's it for me
1 : well i think you can
1 : you can move
2 : and then pass something on
1 : and then
1 : shore up and then you can use your flying power to go to there and then shore that one up
3 : my flying power counts as a power though doesn't it?
1 : oh yeah you're right.
2 : that counts as an action yeah
1 : ok
3 : yeah it's the lift that doesn't count
2 : oh you can use, you're gonna lose a card anyway, right
3 : true ok so let's
2 : so
1 : so if you do that
1 : then that doesn't count as a turn so you can
1 : fly to there and
1 : shore that up
2 : alright
3 : smart move teammate
3 : alright.
3 : are you
1 : alright
3 : two of these
2 : this is here on our way

3 : and then can you hand me three of those?
3 : alright
3 : we have cave of embers, coppper gate and crimson forest
4 : here's the crimson forest
3 : crimson forest
3 : and then golden
3 : gate or copper gate, sorry

4 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : capture is on my next turn anyway so
1 : yeah yeah
