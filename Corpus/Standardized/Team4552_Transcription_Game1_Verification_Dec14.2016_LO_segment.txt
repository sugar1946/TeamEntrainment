1 : just move adjacent once you've sunk
3 : well yeah, you'd be, you'd be able to swim, so you'd be fine.
2 : oh ok, yeah, that's true.
1 : wouldn't matter.
1 : ok, so first thing i can do would be to shore up
1 : two places. i don't see why not.
1 : so, should i just pick these two?
1 : like we did in the beginning.
2 : uh, yeah sure
1 : ok
1 : so that's one action.
2 : mmhmm
1 : uh
1 : i'm also going to move forward,
1 : in front of me,
1 : that's two actions
1 : and then
3 : you can draw treasure cards
1 : is it
2 : oh she he gets one more action.
1 : but do i need another action, is that important?
2 : umm, well it's not really going to hurt you if you use the action, so you might as well.
3 : oh, ok, yeah
1 : cards do you guys have
2 : let's see, i have
3 : i mean
3 : you can't really do you can't give a treasure, you can't capture a treasure, the only thing you can do is
2 : you could, you could just shore up the two adjacent cards, just so that
1 : yeah
3 : wait, can you do that again?
1 : didn't i already do that though?
2 : i don't know if oh can you use that?
1 : i th
1 : yeah, i can only shore up two tiles for one action.
2 : yeah, but it doesn't say you can only use it once per turn, so i think that you can use it for a second action.
3 : can
3 : 
2 : cause like i think if there's a restriction of that sort, it's actually on the card, like for the pilot's card for example, it says that umm
2 : it's once per turn only.
3 : once per turn.
1 : ok
2 : so since yours doesn't say once per turn, i guess you can do it again.
1 : would you is
1 : that like important to do?
2 : umm, i mean like, if we ac if we draw one of those, like
3 : yeah we don't want them to sink.
1 : ok, alright, i'll do that then
2 : yeah, like it would just, i don't know, like it's not hugely important if they do sink, it's just being isolated
3 : well we don't, we don't want them to sink regardless.
1 : ok, so now i need to draw cards. can you grab
2 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, sure
1 : i think two of them.
2 : mmhmm
1 : messenger
1 : alright, water's rise and
1 : whatever that is.
1 : umm
2 : ok
3 : no you have to, nope, nope, nope
2 : oh wait
2 : oh yeah, these are still in play, are they?
3 : shu shuffle those, yeah, they put them there.
2 : oh, ok
2 : wow
1 : i didn't see that
2 : those are significant.
1 : alright, two cards
2 : ok
1 : temple of the moon, lost lagoon
1 : yeah, so it's where i'm standing on
2 : ehh
2 : lost lagoon
2 : does anyone see it?
3 : it's right here.
2 : oh
3 : y
2 : ok
1 : ok, now we put them face up
2 : then discard water's rise and the treasure card, yeah
3 : discard here, give me that
3 : water's rise.
2 : there it is
1 : so, now it's your turn messenger
2 : ok
2 : ok
2 : yeah
2 : so, yeah, first i take three actions
1 : what is our plan of action, before we start keep
3 : umm
1 : i see a lot of pieces right here and it's also really close to this.
2 : mmhmm
1 : wouldn't it be important that we
1 : be
1 : around that area?
1 : is it really i don't think it's important for us to be separated.
2 : it's not super important to spread out but
2 : we should at least try to put ourselves close to the treasure card that we need.
3 : well we should
1 : mmhmm
2 : teasure spaces i mean.
1 : what are we close to?
2 : ok, well we're close with the chalice and we're close with the fire thing. i'll just hold onto this for now, since you're close to the maximum card limit.
1 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : let's see, so
2 : yeah
2 : see i can move
2 : now which one should i
3 : you can shore that up
2 : oh that's right, cause i'm close to it, so might as well do that.
2 : so there's one
2 : then i can
2 : let's see, i can either move or exchange. so i guess what i'll
2 : do is i'll move two spaces, since i have two actions left.
3 : can you, can you move more than once?
2 : mmhmm
3 : oh
2 : yup
2 : let's see, so that would be one action, and then two. let's see, where do i wanna get close to?
2 : should i try to position myself cent closer to the center of the board or
2 : should i get to whispering gardens?
2 : of course, since i can give, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for me to
1 : don't come where i am, because it's gonna be flooded soon
2 : ok
2 : so i guess what i'll do is i'll move one to here
2 : one action, two actions
3 : ok
2 : k, and then, let's see. and draw two treasure
3 : two treasure cards
2 : ok so i have the wind thing and sandbags
2 : and then i draw flood cards, so it's at two right now.
2 : so i can draw two flood cards
2 : and cliffs of abandon
2 : and golden gate
2 : are being flooded.
2 : i'm standing on cliffs of abandon, and op, gold gate's gone.
1 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so i'll flip this over
3 : give me the
3 : yeah
3 : flood card.
3 : thank you
3 : ok
2 : k, next
3 : alright
3 : we should definitely go with these ones cause we you guys already have two so
1 : mmhmm
3 : alright, i don't know, what should i do?
2 : you have two of each.
2 : umm
3 : i'll move here and shore this up.
2 : ok
1 : that's two actions
3 : and then like,
3 : i don't know.
2 : one more action well you could fly yourself somewhere if it would be convenient.
2 : like uh,
2 : don't think you have any corresponding treasure cards at the moment, but
3 : like, no
2 : like you don't have to move if you
2 : if it won't gain you anything.
3 : i don't know, what do you guys think. should i do something or like just stay put?
2 : umm, i would just stay since you're between two, two characters and
3 : ok, yeah, that's true
1 : yeah
2 : i don't know.
1 : you look good there.
3 : thanks
1 : ok
1 : so
2 : let's see
1 : i guess i'll
1 : i sho what did you get?
3 : this, so you should come get me and then i'll give this to you
2 : chalice
1 : ok
1 : ok
3 : at some point.
1 : we can try
3 : ok and then i need
3 : two of those.
2 : ok
3 : breaker's bridge and phantom rock, oh dear.
2 : phantom rock's gone. breaker's bridge
2 : uh, do you see it?
2 : oh
2 : thanks
1 : oh ok
1 : so
3 : actually, you should probably move here and shore those up.
1 : that's what i was gonna do. so that's one action, this will be another
3 : ok
1 : and then
1 : why don't i,
1 : why don't i just
1 : well i can't move
2 : mm
1 : hmm
3 : wait, you can move again, can't you?
2 : see
3 : yeah
1 : well i already moved once, it's one action.
2 : yeah
3 : y you can move again for your another action, didn't we determine that?
2 : uh
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : you can move
3 : so you could come meet me? and then when it's my turn i could give you
3 : my treasure card?
1 : sure, sounds good
2 : yeah, sure
1 : and now i get
1 : two cards,
1 : thank you messenger.
2 : mmhmm
1 : alright
3 : ooo, good things
2 : ok then
1 : so now i have five cards so i can't take any more than this
2 : no
1 : whispering garden and iron gate
2 : iron gate
1 : that's bronze gate
2 : there we go.
2 : ok
3 : we just gotta like watch this, cause this has a
2 : mmhmm
3 : umm, symbol on it, which is important.
2 : yeah but there's,
2 : there's a second one though as well.
3 : yeah i know but if we like end up sinking both of those and we lose the g well i mean not i guess like we don't lose cause we can go and get the other ones, but
2 : yeah, i know what you mean
3 : not a good thing
2 : ok
1 : are we supposed to be moving this up as we go?
2 : then
3 : no, it's only if you get a water's rise card
1 : ok
2 : yeah, so then flood it
1 : oh we're good, we're great.
2 : ok, then it's my turn.
2 : ok, so first thing, let's see
2 : i don't have any important cards at the moment
2 : so i'll just hold onto them.
2 : umm
2 : let's see
2 : i can shore up any of
2 : any one tile on the island
2 : if even if i'm not close to it.
3 : do you wanna get that guy?
2 : umm
2 : sure, i guess we might as well play it.
1 : ok
2 : so let's do that, that doesn't count as an action.
2 : and then
2 : let's see, second act
2 : first action i guess
2 : oo
2 : oh boy.
2 : umm
2 : i don't really see any way to advance or
2 : to advance my position so if there's no useful moves i'll make i'll just refrain from moving.
3 : like yeah.
1 : ok so
1 : i have
1 : three of these cards but i have, i have five total, which is bad.
2 : mmhmm
3 : k so what
1 : but i need you to move
1 : to
1 : whatever this is called.
2 : ok
3 : wait now, y i can't y i have to you since it's my turn, i have to give you your like i can't
2 : you
2 : it's down here
1 : yeah
1 : you have to be on there
1 : with me.
3 : yeah, i know, but like ah you can't give me your cards, i have to give you mine. so this is my turn so like i'll give you
1 : i agree
3 : this card. or wait no, you didn't finish your turn.
1 : i can't
2 : wait ok, wait a second. i didn't finish - i have an idea. so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna come over to
1 : you're right, you're right.
2 : this tile
2 : and
3 : ok that's like probably a good idea. well i'll just be chilling there, it's fine.
1 : ok
2 : oh wait,
2 : hold on a second.
1 : yeah
2 : i just thought
2 : oh ok, wait a second, i can't take stuff from you, can i?
1 : that's a lot of eggs in one basket
2 : no, cause it's not your turn
1 : no you can't yeah i could give it to you.
2 : yeah, never mind oh can you give it to me but even though if it's not your turn?
2 : no you can't, that's right, ok
1 : no
2 : cause i was just thinking we could get rid of that, but that's not gonna work. that's ok
1 : yeah
2 : yeah whatever, then i don't
3 : i mean like it's probably fine to be there, we'll just be like hanging out in the same
2 : yeah, ok, i don't see anymore useful moves to make so. yup
3 : so treasure cards
2 : k so i have
2 : a whatever that is and water's rise.
3 : earth stone
2 : mmhmm
2 : so i move it up a tick mark
2 : umm shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top.
2 : i'm not that great at shuffling.
3 : it's ok
2 : and i discard this pi this card, put this on top
3 : and you gotta pick three cards now
2 : mmhmm
2 : one, two
2 : three. ok, so now we have to
2 : flood lost lagoon,
2 : uh whispering garden, and breaker's bridge.
3 : lost lagoon's there.
3 : breaker's bridge
2 : oh there it is
3 : ok
2 : uh
2 : alright.
2 : k, next person.
3 : ok, it's my turn, so i'm gonna use one action to give this to you
1 : mmhmm
1 : i can't take it, i have five.
2 : yeah but i think once you
2 : take it can you just immediately discard one? i think
1 : can i i can get rid of one?
1 : ok
2 : yeah, i think you can do that.
1 : i'm gonna get rid of the flame card
2 : ok
1 : because there's only two 
3 : i guess if you ever have six or more you must immediately choose and discard so like i think i can give it to you
2 : yeah, i think, i think you can
1 : six or more?
1 : ok, i'll take it.
2 : yeah
3 : so no i mean like that doesn't count as one of your cards, so just discard the
1 : yeah
3 : earth stone i guess.
3 : -s. or, actually
2 : or the fire, whichever.
1 : the f
3 : no, probably the fire cause we actually have more of the earth stones now
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : mmhmm
1 : i guess that goes in the pile then?
3 : yeah
2 : yup
3 : ok, so that was one move. should i shore up this?
2 : umm
1 : what else are you gonna do?
2 : sure
3 : like, probably nothing.
2 : yeah
3 : or unless i could give,
3 : i could give this card to you, can i give more than one?
2 : umm
3 : i could give this to you, or does it, i guess it doesn't really matter, we all have one.
2 : yeah, i think you can.
2 : yeah
3 : or should i give it to him so like
2 : no you, yeah you can't give it to him. umm
1 : why not?
3 : oh wait, yeah, never mind
3 : you have too many
2 : i mean, it's i, i have more cards than you do so i think
1 : oh, you're right.
3 : well i could give it to you, we're also standing
1 : yeah this would be a convenient time.
2 : that's
3 : on the same
2 : yeah go ahead, yeah.
2 : let's do that.
3 : alright
3 : cool.
2 : so how many actions is that, two?
3 : that was three cause i gave two cards and shored that up, so
2 : see
2 : three
2 : ok
3 : and then i need three flood cards.
2 : oh yeah
3 : iron gate,
3 : temple of the moon, and cliffs of abandon. iron gate is gone.
2 : temple of the moon
2 : and cliffs
1 : and
3 : cliffs of abandon.
2 : cliffs uh, oh there they are.
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : alright
1 : so
3 : ok, what you should do first
1 : shore up
3 : shore that up
3 : move, and then cash in the treasure.
2 : and then move
1 : yup
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : 
3 : so
2 : wait
3 : but you don't have to move. no, no, no don't do that, don't do that.
2 :  you don't have to move.
1 : oh, no i don't move, no. you're right. ok so shore it up.
2 : yeah
3 : you can flip that,
3 : move to there,
3 : and then cash in the treasure.
2 : as this third action?
1 : is
2 : yup
1 : where does that go?
2 : yeah just
3 : take it
1 : sweet
2 : yeah
1 : ok, so now i can do one more thing, correct? or is that
2 : so that was three
2 : no, that was, that was three.
3 : no, that was three.
1 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, you're right.
3 : and then you need three flood cards.
1 : copper gate,
1 : mm
1 : crimson forest,
1 : and
1 : temple of the sun.
3 : we just gotta find copper gate
2 : oh, there it is, it's right below the
3 : oh, ok
3 : alright
2 : ok
1 : right there
2 : umm
2 : yeah just put it there. ok, next
2 : it's my turn, umm
1 : what are we trying to do? what's next? so we have an idea.
2 : next
2 : so we have four
3 : we have four of these so
1 : we have four of the
2 : ok
2 : so what i could do, is i could transfer two of them to you on this turn, using up two.
3 : and then cause he can go down here and get
2 : yeah and then you can use then you can transfer one on that turn.
3 : them.
3 : i would just need to move to meet him and then give it to him.
1 : or you could fly to me, right?
2 : yeah
3 : i mean like, yeah
3 : theoretically i could fly to you.
2 : yeah that's that one
3 : but you're right next to me so i wouldn't do that.
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok, so first i'm gonna take two actions and give the engineer
2 : the two wind cards.
1 : i'm not on the same thing with you.
1 : i'm not
2 : no, i don't have to you don't have to be. i can give it to you anywhere i am.
3 : she can, she can give any yeah
1 : oh, really?
1 : awesome, ok
2 : ok
2 : so that's
3 : or wait, can you give multiple it says give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action, so i think it's only one action.
2 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, one eh, one action, one action per card, so therefore i gave two cards so that's two actions used. i can use one more
1 : one action, sweet.
3 : oh
3 : two, ok.
2 : umm
2 : but
2 : let's see
3 : i mean
2 : but i can no cause moving would take an action and flipping would be another action, so it doesn't look like
2 : mm
2 : see unless i just moved
1 : keep thinking about what you're doing
1 : umm
1 : pilot, you should move
1 : uh, you should fly there and i can give you all three of these,
1 : and you can immediately take it.
3 : i mean you can't give them to me, i can only give you can only give cards on your turn. so i can just meet you here, give you these cards, and then on your turn you could go there.
1 : why can't i give them to you?
2 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : you could what you could do during your turn though is fly him to that space
1 : ok
3 : i very well could do that.
2 : as well.
2 : yeah
2 : so since you're on the same space give the card
3 : and this doesn't count as an action
2 : then fly him to yeah exactly.
3 : ok
1 : and you can go there too.
3 : perfect
2 : ok
3 : so are you gonna do
2 : i have one more, i have one more turn but i don't think ah there's an action that would advance us so i guess
2 : actually what i will do is i'll move up here so i'm in a position to umm save more tiles.
3 : ok
2 : so that's action three and then treasure cards.
1 : wouldn't
1 : moving the other way would've saved more tiles? doesn't matter now.
3 : i mean, these are all
2 : yeah
2 : oh
2 : yeah good point.
2 : i don't think, i don't think i can take back moves now though.
3 : can you
1 : yeah, don't worry about it.
2 : ok, so there's this one
2 : ok i don't know what we do with treasure cards where i'm guessing just discard at my leisure
2 : alright, so i have a water's rise
2 : so i'll move that up a tick mark
2 : then
3 : shuffle,
2 : place on top, i get these a lot.
3 : i gonna just take that for ya
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok
2 : placing that on top, and then, take three.
3 : and pick three
2 : so we have whispering gardens,
2 : which is now gone, cliffs of abandon
3 : here you need whispering gardens
2 : oh yup
2 : and then the third one is temple of the sun.
3 : that's gone too
2 : yeah, ok, so that's gonna be
3 : can i have that and then cliffs of abandon is
2 : oh temples of the sun's gone, ok. cliffs of abandon, i'm standing on that one.
3 : yeah
1 : did you shore up anything yet?
2 : i didn't i didn't have time on my turn.
1 : ok
1 : because we only have these
2 : yeah, my first ac my first action will be to save them
1 : well we have this is the last one
3 : ok, i'm gonna use, i'm gonna sandbag this because we need this guy. ok, it doesn't count as an action, so like, cool.
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : yeah, makes sense
2 : go ahead
3 : umm, this also doesn't count as an action. i'm gonna fly you here,
1 : ok
3 : then
2 : k, first action
3 : i'm gonna fly here and give you that card.
1 : that's your t
2 : that's one
3 : that's one,
2 : one,
3 : two
2 : two, mmhmm
2 : let's see one, two, three, four, you need to get rid of one of your cards now.
1 : one, two, three, four, ok, i just have to
3 : umm
3 : get rid of the fire probably.
1 : like
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : and then
3 : should i do anything else or just like hang out down there? should i move
2 : uh i don't think it would advance our position
3 : i mean, i can just move back so i'm closer to the middle kind of area
1 : or it wouldn't, it wouldn't hurt
1 : yeah, it wouldn't hurt
2 : that's a good point
2 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : oh, two
3 : oh dear
3 : and then three
2 : oh, yeah
3 : copper gate is gone
1 : ok
3 : crimson forest is also gone
3 : oh no
3 : and breaker's bridge
2 : ok, it's flooded again.
1 : ok, so my first thing will be to
1 : get the little guy.
1 : so that's one action
2 : mmhmm
2 : see
1 : my next action
2 : wait a second, i have an idea.
2 : so, you have one of the stone cards. i have
2 : two of the stone cards, so on my action i could give all three to the pilot and the pilot could go to one of the temples
1 : she has one
3 : that's true, i mean the only temple that's left
1 : can you fly
1 : how bout this
1 : do you wanna fly me there? you have two cards
3 : i mean i can't do that now i'd have to wait till my turn.
2 : i mean
1 : on no you can't
2 : i think it would save some time if you give me the cards then i give her all the cards so that she can play it on her turn instead of us having to wait again for it to be your turn.
1 : wait
1 : but you're standing here
2 : i am
1 : how would i get there?
2 : i'm the messenger, i can give you a card anywhere
1 : ok
2 : i can or like, wait a second, oh you're right, you have to get to me.
3 : just like, i think as one of your moves you should just move towards the c-center more.
2 : let's see, if you go one,
2 : two, and then three, you'll be on, that'd be on the space.
3 : that
3 : he already played, he can't with the getting a treasure was one card so he could just get two and then get closer to the center.
2 : that's true,
2 : oh that's true.
1 : how bout i do
2 : no, that won't
1 : can i move tw i can move twice and shore up both of these.
3 : you can't because
3 : or shh
3 : does shoring up count as an action? that's one action
2 : it does
1 : that's
1 : yeah
3 : so you can't shore up anything cause you already used one action, you have two actions left.
2 : mm, good point.
1 : ooo
2 : hmm
2 : yeah
2 : so
2 : hmm
3 : i just think you should move to be more centrally located, cause there's really nothing else that like he could do right now. unless or unless, he could
2 : no, good point
1 : yup
2 : oh, wait a second
3 : he unless he moves to here and then gives me his treasure card
2 : yeah, that's a good idea, let's do that. let's go with that move.
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : can i have two cards please?
2 : mmhmm
1 : k, we'll need those eventually.
3 : or maybe not.
1 : tidal palace,
1 : temple of the moon,
1 : and lost lagoon.
3 : lost lagoon's gone.
1 : ok
1 : we didn't need it anyways.
2 : ok
3 : wait, no, nope.
1 : oh
2 : ok, then it's my turn.
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok you should shore up temple of the moon for sure
2 : see if
2 : yeah, that's gonna be my first move,
2 : then my second
