3 : right
1 : ok
1 : so i'm going to move
1 : and
1 : i can shore up two cause i'm the engineer.
1 : right?
3 : yes
1 : ok
1 : and then
3 : so do you have one more action left?
1 : yeah but would anything be useful?
3 : umm
1 : at the moment
3 : you could shore up that one, the one you're on.
1 : ok
1 : did i move?
1 : move yourself one space in a horizontal or vertical direction.
1 : adjacent
1 : 
3 : oh so you shored up
3 : this one
1 : oh, oh, oh, my bad. my bad.
1 : ok
1 : so i can shore up this one?
3 : mmhmm
1 : and
2 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : i already shored up this one. ok.
2 : i see
1 : got it
3 : and then you can shore up that one since that would be your third action.
1 : oh i can do three shh.
1 : oh cause that's two ok ok ok gotcha.
3 : yeah
2 : you get up to three actions right?
3 : there yeah
2 : ok
1 : and then draw two
1 : treasure cards.
2 : and get
2 : two of the treasure?
3 : mmhmm
1 : thank you. a water's rise. a solid start
1 : sorry guys
2 : ok
1 : so discard
1 : and
3 : that goes over here yeah.
1 : here
3 : and then we shuffle the
1 : shh these.
1 : put them on top
3 : and then we draw the cards.
1 : these two.
2 : oh the flood cards. we got two
3 : mmhmm
1 : it's still two.
1 : breaker's bridge and the gold gate.
2 : 
1 : gold gate
1 : gold gate
3 : umm
1 : got it
1 : no!
2 : that's gone.
1 : didn't even get to know it well.
1 : ok and put this in here.
2 : and that one's back here ok.
1 : your turn?
2 : am i up?
2 : so now what do i wanna do here?
1 : oh boy.
2 : so i can take up to three actions.
1 : ok so you can't shore up any.
1 : right?
1 : because you're not
2 : i can give treasure cards.
2 : i can pass one of these your way. that'd be one.
1 : that's really nice of you.
2 : doesn't matter who collects them does it?
1 : uh uh
2 : ok
3 : oh you could,
2 : and i think i'm gonna move two maybe to
3 : you could move there and then umm
1 : shore, oh
3 : shore up that one.
2 : mmhmm three good. ok
3 : or did that, is that too many
3 : that's one oh yeah
2 : no that's two
1 : the one two three.
3 : three yeah
2 : and then this would be the third right.
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : eh
2 : so i've done that, now i need to draw two treasure deck cards. that's these.
1 : is this
2 : ok that wasn't bad.
2 : and now draw flood cards equal to the flood level which is two.
2 : whispering garden and lost lagoon.
2 : lost lagoon is lost.
2 : so that's gone, wait over there.
2 : and this one goes back here.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : yeah
2 : is there anything else i need to do? do we have to shuffle those ?
1 : oh do we shu no we didn't flood , no yeah ok.
3 : no
2 : ok
3 : alright
3 : well it's my turn.
2 : is it
2 : on to you now?
3 : yeah ok
3 : umm ok so what i am
3 : d-d-doo
1 : what's your power again?
3 : 
3 : i can move anywhere so i'm going to move here and then
1 : ok
1 : sure.
3 : shore up that one
3 : and
3 : i don't think i'm going to do anything else
3 : since this card isn't really all useful if we lose it.
1 : ok
3 : umm
3 : and i take
1 : two
2 : two
3 : two
3 : two treasures and a helicopter.
3 : ok
3 : and then i got two of those right.
2 : you need two flood cards.
3 : ok
3 : cliffs of abandon
3 : let it go, yeah
1 : there you go
3 : and phantom rock
1 : there it goes.
3 : now
3 : ok
2 : and then it goes back over here.
3 : ok
1 : my turn
1 : ok so
1 : i can shore up to start right?
1 : i don't have to move first.
3 : hmm we could
1 : i guess
1 : moving's not
3 : we could move
3 : closer so you could get one the
1 : ooo good call. i've
1 : two of either, so
1 : here
1 : and
2 : what if you move here and then you have the opportunity for either one.
3 : oh yeah that's a good idea.
1 : make two moves
3 : yeah that would be your third, third action yeah.
2 : that would be your third, right? unless there was something better. but
1 : third yeah.
1 : no i don't think so.
1 : ok
1 : and then done.
1 : and then
2 : you get two of those.
1 : two of these.
1 : oh
3 : oops
1 : my bad
2 : there we go
1 : ok
1 : cool
1 : so now i six. i have to discard.
1 : one
2 : is this a copter
1 : and
1 : draw the flood cards.
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon
2 : iron gate
3 : oh here it is ok.
1 : cool
2 : is that it?
1 : think so
2 : alright what am i doing here.
2 : we don't have anything we need to sandbag do we so i'm thinking of moving toward the
2 : the treasure. does that make good sense? so i can do three.
1 : yeah that makes sense.
3 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
2 : so one, two. do i wanna? 
3 : you couldn't shore it up.
3 : uh
1 : from there.
2 : and then i could shore it up.
2 : once it gets hot
2 : ok so i've done that. now two treasure cards.
2 : water's rise, sorry.
3 : and that goes over here.
2 : that goes there and i need to shuffle the flood deck.
1 : yeah
2 : and put
2 : put it on top of the
2 : pile
2 : am i done here?
3 : and then  and just draw the cards.
2 : draw the cards, i need to draw three now.
1 : right
2 : ok so cliffs of abandon.
2 : thank you.
2 : iron gate is gone.
2 : breaker's bridge is here.
2 : ok and these go here.
3 : ok
1 : yup
2 : alright
3 : so i'm, i'm blue
3 : i'm gonna fly
3 : to
3 : your spot and then my other action's going to be to give you
1 : oh thank you.
3 : this card here.
1 : so then do a discard right now?
3 : yes.
1 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : discard
1 : over there
2 : goes over here.
3 : yeah
3 : and then i'm going to umm
3 : shore up this one.
3 : and now we draw cards here.
1 : ok
3 : ok
3 : another sandbag
3 : one. and then i get  three.
3 : and that
1 : 
1 : er
1 : yeah.
3 : k
3 : and
3 : howling garden
2 : it's here.
3 : temple of the moon
3 : and
3 : and whispering garden, so we should rescue one of those,
1 : yeah
3 : probably.
3 : umm
3 : ok
1 : umm does o one of these hold priority over
3 : should we, should we s
3 : probably this one, just because this one's like kinda far away from us.
1 : ok
3 : so i can sandbag
3 : that
1 : 
3 : one
3 : and do that.
1 : so san, sandbags don't count?
1 : as a ok cool.
3 : and no it's you can use it any time.
1 : my turn?
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
1 : red
1 : hmm
1 : do i want to head up?
3 : oh you have
1 : here?
3 : uh
2 : and i've got the
3 : you're, you're blue.
1 : oh wait but i have
3 : or so you're red, so you want to move here and then capture the, yeah
1 : red
2 : eh
2 : yeah i think you do, you want to take the treasure.
1 : here and then capture.
3 : eh
3 : and then
1 : ok
1 : so to capture treasure
1 : discard four.
1 : and then
1 : ok
3 : and that's their second action.
1 : can i just
2 : so you get to hang on to that. ok.
1 : take it
3 : yeah
1 : mine, ok.
3 : umm
1 : umm so is that
1 : one action?
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : and  you have one more but i don't know if you can anything else. i guess you can
2 : it's good idea for me sandbag the ah temple of the moon up there or one of these other ones.
1 : sure
2 : just uh so it doesn't go anywhere if you pick a, a card.
1 : pro
1 : probably.
3 : hmm
3 : yeah
3 : i guess so
2 : what do you think does that seem reasonable since it's got a treasure and it can throw
3 : ah
1 : yeah
2 : that there
3 : ok
2 : i don't know if there's any reason to save it. yeah.
1 : and then
3 : oh you have to do the water's rising right or the
1 : yeah
3 : flood cards
2 : so we got three
1 : umm cave of embers
2 : that's over there, and we don't even care about that anymore do we?
3 : no
1 : copper gate crimson forest
2 : those are up that way.
3 : alright
1 : crimson forest
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : are we all done?
2 : alright now what?
1 : no it's your turn?
2 : yes
1 : ok
2 : i'm not sure what action i want to take here really
3 : umm
2 : umm
2 : do i have to be right on the umm
3 : you
3 : you need to be on the tile
2 : on the tile to capture it, do we want tgo go up there and get ready?
3 : yeah but next round, yeah next round i can give you
1 : 
3 : or you could move or i could move.
3 : oh
2 : oh you didn't take treasure. how many do you get two?
1 : sorry
3 : thanks
1 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : oops
2 : ok
1 : ah
2 : so
3 : so
3 : so i could give you
2 : you could give me that i'll have three and then i've got that
3 : that one and then
1 : ok
3 : you could give, you could give me that
2 : i could eh, i could do that as one of my umm
3 : the
1 : move yeah
2 : actions. why don't i start with that cause i
3 : yeah
2 : i can do that, i'll move here. that's two.
3 : and then you can move closer.
2 : maybe
3 : and then i guess you could
3 : shore up that one.
2 : shore that one up? that's a good thought.
2 : ok so i've done three actionsn now i draw two cards right.
2 : ugh and it's a water's rise
3 : the water's rise
2 : so i've got to shuffle the deck.
1 : i'll slide up.
2 : move it up one
2 : discard this card to that.
2 : i got that. we don't care about this card.
2 : draw flood cards equal to the water level. is that where were at
1 : three still
2 : one, two, three.
2 : alright so crimson forest is going back down.
2 : howling garden? uh oh we're in trouble that's gone.
3 : oh
2 : and whispering garden
3 : oh that's not good.
1 : oh no.
2 : no ok let's pay attention to that one, save the garden.
1 : save the whipsering garden!
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : we set?
3 : mmhmm
2 : and you're up
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : let's see. well i'm gonna, where am i, blue.
3 : gonna move over here and then give
3 : you this card.
2 : thank you
3 : ah
1 : wait do you have to move here to be able to
3 : yeah i have to be in the same thing then
1 : ok
3 : umm
3 : and then
3 : i'm going to use
3 : my helicopter card
3 : and
3 : fly myself over here to
1 : ooo! well played
3 : and then i'll be my next
1 : ok
3 : third action.
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : helicopter
3 : yay
3 : ok
3 : and now i umm do the
2 : you need the flood cards, what do you need three?
3 : three
3 : ok
3 : ah cliffs of abandon
2 : umm
3 : and
3 : cave of embers
3 : oh
3 : good bye
2 : it doesn't matter though
3 : and then
3 : copper gate.
3 : oh copper gate's gone. that's not good.
2 : ah it's gone.
2 : ok
3 : go
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : ok yeah
1 : gonna give you this.
3 : and now
2 : thank you
3 : oh you have to be in the same
1 : ah
2 : oh you have to be on the
3 : tile though.
3 : i could fly you there
2 : do, do that.
1 : would you mind?
3 : i could fly you there.
1 : thanks, uh right there.
3 : you're
3 : eh yeah
2 : ok
1 : ok, so now i can give you this and did that count as one of my
2 : and now i got it thank you
3 : no cause i that's just uh
1 : moves? that's just ok
2 : that's you doing that
1 : so then there's counts as one and then should i
2 : but giving me the card counts as one
3 : umm
3 : yeah
2 : is there anything we need? we
1 : do we care about
1 : either of these particularly more than
3 : i guess you can move here and then shore up that one since that's part of the main island
1 : can shore up.
1 : ok
1 : and then
1 : two treasure cards please?
2 : ok
1 : oh
2 : oh that's nice.
1 : ok
1 : and then
3 : three
1 : three of these
1 : silver gate
1 : temple of the moon
1 : oh no
2 : uh oh
1 : silver gate
1 : and breaker's bridge. ah
2 : breaker's bridge is gone then?
1 : gone.
1 : is that these two
2 : silver gate
2 : ah
2 : ok
3 : hmm
1 : ok
3 : is that it?
3 : oh so it's your turn now.
3 : so you can, you can capture.
2 : can i capture it while it's flooded?
3 : yeah
3 : yeah it's not uh
2 : i can?
1 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : so that's
1 : yay!
2 : definitely what i'm doing there so those go in the treasure pile.
3 : no
3 : yeah i think so
2 : alright so that's one action.
3 : you
3 : you could move and then shore up that one or you could yeah i guess
3 : since you already have it it doesn't matter.
2 : is there anything else i want or need to do here?
3 : uh
3 : no
3 : i don't think so.
1 : yeah cause we don't need that card.
3 : yeah
2 : or do i want to move off the, the flooded one, just in case? i don't think i want to be swimming.
3 : yeah, i think, i think moving would be a good idea.
1 : swimming
1 : ah
2 : so we've got that, that's one.
2 : is there a reason not move one more closer to the middle of things?
3 : two
3 : no since we have two
3 : two umm treasures, yeah.
2 : maybe this gives me more options if i go here and then
1 : ok
2 : then i can move to either of those.
3 : mmhmm
2 : so have i drawn two fly now i've lost track of where i was. draw two treasure deck cards then. ok.
1 : i know.
2 : got two and then draw flood cards. so i have one, two
2 : three, ok dunes of deception
2 : coral palace
2 : and the bronze gate.
2 : ok
2 : think we're good. and it's on to you.
3 : mmhmm.
3 : ok
3 : mm
3 : alrighty
3 : i
3 : umm
1 : which
1 : let's see, we need these two
1 : oh you're on your way to that.
3 : i'm gonna
3 : i'm gonna move here and
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : shore up this one.
1 : nice.
3 : and then
3 : umm
3 : i don't think you can do anything else
3 : huh
3 : mm
3 : we already have that one, discard that one.
3 : ok and then three of those cards.
1 : and three of these.
3 : ok it's tidal palace
3 : one right there, it's right in front of me.
3 : ah temple of the sun
2 : ah down here.
3 : right over there.
3 : and then misty marsh
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : ok umm
1 : so
1 : should i
1 : shore this, move one
1 : capture treasure
3 : mm
3 : no i wouldn't
3 : this, probably this move.
2 : is there anything up that way we need. i don't think so cause we already get this treasure, right?
3 : nnhmm no, i would probably just move here
1 : and move it
1 : to
3 : and then your third would be the capture and then we'd have all of our treasures.
1 : the capture
2 : so we've got three.
1 : so we just need to get to fool's landing?
3 : yeah
1 : and then can i have two treasure?
3 : oh water's rise.
1 : uh ok
1 : oh
2 : that goes over here.
1 : uh
1 : and j
3 : umm
2 : yeah you have to shuffle them. put them on top of the flood draw pile.
3 : ah yeah
3 : then you could
3 : umm well after you do that, you could, you could use your thing to move these two here.
3 : and then you can
1 : whoa!
1 : whoa!
1 : both of them?
1 : move?
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok.
1 : and then discard.
2 : i have to discard that.
1 : and then
2 : and now
2 : it's me
1 : yeah
2 : you know what, i think do you is there any reason to
3 : oh no you have to do the umm the flood, the umm the-the three.
1 : ah! i have to draw the flood cards still.
2 : oh
2 : oh i forgot.
1 : ok coral palace, dunes of
1 : deception.
2 : that's going that way.
1 : and the silver gate.
3 : not much of a no silver gate's gone.
2 : silver gate ok, right there
2 : ok and that one goes back here.
1 : oh
3 : alright and now, now it's your turn
2 : so now it's up to me. so we don't, we don't need any other treasures?
3 : no
2 : so
1 : do we have to get you to fool's landing?
3 : i just need to get to fool's landing and then
2 : and then we're off so.
1 : and then we're free.
3 : i'll use, i'll use this. so i just
2 : so do i need to do anything or umm
3 : umm
3 : no i don't
1 : is there anything you need to shore?
2 : is there any action i should do?
3 : oh we should shore up
3 : this one.
2 : ca i could shore that up.
1 : just, just cause
3 : cause of, yeah.
2 : makes me feel better. ok
1 : yeah
2 : alright and then take two cards.
2 : i don't think we care about any of these right?
3 : yeah, and then just the
1 : ah
1 : and then flood.
2 : and then three of those.
1 : ah
3 : yay! we're gonna
2 : ok what do we have temple of the sun

2 : tidal palace
3 : also gone.
2 : it's gone. the bronze gate.
1 : 
2 : it's gone our island is shrinking. ok.
3 : and then
3 : yeah i think it's good, right?
