2 : oh you have treasure
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : oh
2 : k
2 : this is gone.

1 : right so, maybe next turn you can hand those over.
3 : oh wait a minute, what's the messengers turn?
2 : turn
3 : oh
2 : that's my special power
3 : that is your special power. it's ok though. i only had one so ok

1 : yeah
2 : then we'll be able to cash out.
3 : give treasure cards
3 : right
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : wait ok that's good.
2 : so bronze gate
2 : goes under, whoops
3 : you're good
2 : cave of shadows
3 : cave of shadows, that sounds terrifying
2 : of shadows
2 : and dunes of deception go under
3 : dunes of deception, these are great.
1 : that doesn't sound especially nice either.
3 : great.
3 : umm
3 :  umm
3 : ok
3 : we're cool?
1 : mmhmm.
3 : so
3 : what we can do
3 : is i will move
2 : all of us to fool's landing?
3 : let's think
3 : we should save this because we're only one treasure away.
3 : we're gonna need that to get off.
1 : so maybe you could move her and shore this one up since it has an earth stone.
1 : i can't.
3 : uh
3 : i'm on board.
3 : so you'd shore that up.
3 : and that's my second move.
3 : and now i'll shore
3 : this one up for good measure.
1 : or maybe even this one so you guys don't get trapped.
3 : there is a better idea.
3 : ah hah.
2 : hah
2 : shh
3 : ah ha she's a sharp one.
2 : ha
3 : umm ok.
3 : now before i do this do i want to use maybe a sandbag or something?
2 : oh
3 : we're good, we're gonna need
2 : sure, sure you can use the sandbag's out of play.
3 : where are you right now?
1 : i'm here.
3 : ok
3 : cause we wanna get you to fire.
3 : now
3 : umm
2 : oh that's one of your actions
3 : what if i use a sandbag on this before my turn is over?
1 : to make sure we don't lose it.
3 : right
1 : yeah cause i think we lost one already
3 : and then i could fly you there but i don't know how many of these are left in there.
3 : oh forget it that was
2 : yeah don't waste that. you could fly can you fly your 
1 : yeah maybe.
3 : i can only fly myself
2 : oh
3 : right
3 :  
3 : umm so how about i do that?
3 : all in favor so i?
2 : yeah
1 : sure
3 : oh alright
2 : yeah, yeah
3 : ok
3 : now
3 : two
3 : and we got fire and a chalice and i still have five
3 : and i need three of those.
2 : two, three
3 : the clock is ticking.
1 : it is
2 : 
3 : misty marsh
3 : where green is.
1 : mmhmm.
3 : ah  please, howling garden is down here.
3 : and cave of embers
3 : cave of embers
3 : alright
1 : which we can't get to anyway
3 : right that's it's done.
3 : so engineer
3 : what'll it be?
1 : i think i'm gonna take all my actions to move.
2 : you can't have more than
2 : oh five
3 : no, that's, that's her engineer card. she has five.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : yeah ok
3 : yeah she's good.
1 : ok
1 : so i was thinking i would just go
1 : here
1 : and then cash in
1 : next turn.
3 : ok
3 : i'm on board
1 : ok so that's all my actions
3 : cool
1 : ah now i have to discard two now
2 : you do?
3 : well you're using the, using the water rush one, right now.
1 : oh yeah, you're right, your're right.
3 : yeah
3 : it's easy to lose one of them.
1 : good point, good point.
2 : good point.
3 : good point, we get it.
3 : umm now that's upgrade, three more.
