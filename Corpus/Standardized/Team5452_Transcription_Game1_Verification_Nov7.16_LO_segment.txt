1 : alright so i start, so i guess i might as well shore up
2 : ok
2 : uh yeah, yes.
1 : everything that i can.
1 : while i'm
2 : go for it
1 : here
1 : so that's one turn
1 : two turns, should i go anywhere else? or
1 : take another turn
2 : umm what else can you do? can you give cards?
3 : let's see so did
3 : so you did you move and did you do your two shore ups?
2 : oh you should yeah
1 : yeah
3 : two double shore ups and a uh
3 : so that would be three actions?
1 : oh yeah i guess it would be moving ok so i'm done
4 : yeah
4 : so
3 : mmhmm
2 : oh, oh so you need just the top two?
3 : so
4 : ok
4 : draw two treasure cards
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : oh man ok so we gotta
3 : already?
2 : ah
1 : already
1 : great
2 : so do we shh
2 : do we shuffle these?
3 : yup
1 : yeah
2 : then i'll dar discard this
1 : thank you
3 : ok
1 : and then i take
2 : three
4 : uh it's still on two i think so
1 : t-two
1 : it's still on two
2 : oh ok
3 : it's still on two
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok so
1 : temple of the moon
4 : which you're on
1 : so i'm on that and then golden gate
3 : golden gate, golden gate, ah we lost golden gate.
2 : oh no
1 : oh that's sad
2 : ok
2 : so now it's my turn?
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : so i am
4 : did you
4 : that card also needs to go in here i believe
3 : oh thank you, thank you, the golden gate card
1 : oh yeah
1 : good call
2 : ok
2 : so i am going to
2 : give this to you
2 : just in case and
2 : shore this
2 : that's two, i think i'm, should i do one more or is that
2 : and i think isn't it, is two shore ups count as one i thought
2 : so hers was
3 : for the engineer. engineer can do two shores ups as one action, everyone else it's
1 : yeah for me i can do two it's like one
2 : oh so she could have taken another
4 : can only do
3 : no no she shored up
2 : couldn't ok
1 : cause i moved yeah
3 : moved to shh mmhmm.
2 : oh ok ok
2 : so should i move or should i just stay?
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : do i need to be closer to, ok i'm going to start moving to fool's landing.
3 : good i good idea get a little
2 : just because
4 : yeah
4 : umm i don't
1 : oh yeah you can't go diagonal
2 : ok
4 : you can't move diagonally though
2 : oh right ok so
4 : so
4 : you could move
4 : yeah
2 : yeah that's just an l both ways
1 : ok
2 : ok so i have a sandbag and then i'll do this ok i'm good.
3 : and flip
2 : and then
1 : yeah
2 : two of these?
4 : so
1 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
4 : two yeah
2 : so lost
2 : umm lagoon and phantom rock
1 : oh
1 : that's right there.
3 : oh no phantom rock's gone.
1 : ah man
2 : 
2 : oh man ok
3 : ok, ok my turn i'm on fool's landing
3 : i'm gonna helicopter over to uh lost lagoon as my first action and then shore it up as a second one.
3 : and
3 : as i'm the only one with an earth card right here, i'm just going to umm
3 : i'm gonna stick close to you right here if we need to uh trade off things so i took my two actions, draw two treasure cards please not uh water rise cards
1 : alright
3 : i get a ah
3 : one of the water treasures and another
3 : ah
2 : oh so you
1 : oh you can only mo
2 : you couldn't do the last. you
1 : you can only
2 : couldn't
1 : helicopter over there 
2 : but couldn't you move one?
3 : oh sorry that wa that was a diagonal move. i am sorry, it was a diagonal move, that's what the error was so
1 : that makes sense
3 : sorry about that. i'm just gonna move horizontally cause we cou all of u cause you are the only one who can move diagonally right?
4 : mmhmm
1 : yes
3 : ok, ok we're good.
2 : we, yeah we're getting there don't worry
3 : ok so it was helicopter
1 : mmhmm
3 : shore up
3 : now
3 : orthogonal move
3 : two cards
1 : yeah and then we need
3 : got a water treasure, i have four, i don't have to discard anything now. flood, cities of abandon and breaker's bridge
1 : ok that's breaker's bridge
3 : oh good and city, cliffs of abandon. yeah thanks, thanks. these go on the discard pile
3 : and i think i am done then
4 : ok umm
1 : alright
4 : i'm gonna move diagonally
4 : and
4 : then shore up, so that was two
4 : umm
4 : so before they were both sunk i was thinking about
4 : using one of my turns to move to you and then give you that but
4 : discard it umm
3 : ah
3 : you could try to move closer and we could do a handoff on my turn.
4 : yeah
4 : i'm just gonna move over here that way i'm at least
1 : yeah that probably works
4 : well let me see
4 : because you have
1 : yeah we don't have
4 : i think it's better that i move closer to you cause i do have one of the same cards as you.
1 : yeah
3 : uh i think you moved dia, did you move diagonally on that one?
4 : ok
1 : yeah you can't
4 : yeah on both of them, i'm, i'm allowed to so yeah
3 : oh duh, oh sorry, that i just said you were the one
1 : alright
2 : can you shore that up on one of your turns?
4 : no i already use
1 : or i can shore i mean it's my turn now.
4 : three turns
2 : uh ok
2 : oh
3 : so you got your your actions and i
4 : so
4 : yeah so
1 : oh yeah we still have to do that
3 : get
3 : two of these cards
4 : ok
4 : and then two of these, whispering garden and iron gate
1 : is that one
3 : i got iron gate
1 : alright
4 : ok
1 : so should probably shore this up
1 : so that's one
1 : umm
1 : 
3 : we better get, if we had a way then, better to get to whispering gar-garden
4 : yeah everything's far away.
1 : yeah
3 : actually you're the ex
4 : well
3 : you're the one we're going to be passing off the cards to and
4 : she's closest to whispering garden so on her turn i think
1 : yeah so you could
1 : should i just move to you guys just
4 : yeah it's probably not bad to be on the
1 : in case
1 : so we can get these
4 : yeah i
1 : ones maybe?
1 : is that what
4 : think that would be good?
1 : alright
2 : so do you need to be near me to get those cards or can i just take them on my turn?
4 : umm you're the messenger, so i think you can give me a card from wherever.
1 : but then you'll have more cards in your hand you'll have to discard one so we have to wait on that one.
2 : ok
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : ok then
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : actually ah, if you've got five cards
3 : if you've got ah an extra action, do you ha do you have any actions left? you could hand off one of those cards.
3 : to ah one of two of us
3 : if you want
4 : it's not my turn though so if i can't hand off.
3 : oh ok ok that's right.
1 : yeah it was my turn, i still have one more move but
3 : that's right sorry
1 : nothing really
4 : uh i would just
2 : ok
4 : leave that action there.
1 : yeah
1 : so i guess it's your turn.
2 : oh
4 : and did you draw your two cards?
1 : oh no i forgot. good thing. i always forget to do that.
1 : oh i got another water's rise card.
2 : oh no
1 : i no
4 : well this is bad now.
2 : ok
1 : i know
2 : so you have copper gate, temple of the sun, crimson forest
1 : we have to ah put these on top first yeah
3 : why do
2 : oh my god sorry
3 : yeah we have to shuffle first
2 : that's sucks guys
4 : yeah we're
3 : and then ah this goes into the
1 : yeah
3 : thank you
1 : so  we got
1 : temple of the moon
1 : breaker's bridge
1 : and iron gate, umm
4 : ok
2 : iron gate
1 : yeah oh it's gone.
4 : oh and we're on breaker's bridge
3 : ok
1 : oh and
1 : of course
2 : ok have we lost any of the ones where we can go to?
3 : i didn't
4 : ah
3 : umm no
4 : as far as
3 : no i think we've got, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven all the treasure spots are good.
4 : you mean like for the treasures?
2 : ok this one is like
1 : mmhmm
2 : in
2 : in like a danger zone so
3 : critical
1 : yeah
4 : wait of we have seven that means we did lose one, but
3 :  temp
3 : alright, i i count, i count eight, eight on the board.
4 : i think right
4 : oh eight ok then
1 : ok
2 : oh
4 : umm
4 : so it's your turn?
2 : ok so should i just give this to you or
4 : umm
4 : so i think one of the things you want to do is
2 : i can't
4 : shore that up
2 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
4 : so that's one turn
1 : you might
4 : i don't know if you should move and then shore that up and wait to give me that card?
1 : oh
1 : if you wait then you can give me that one which
4 : yeah
1 : if you guys both gave me the blue one that would get rid of all of them
4 : yeah i think i would
4 : move and then
4 : shore up temple of the moon
4 : you can you can move there and then since you're adjacent to it you can
2 : oh right cause i can't move diagonally sorry guys
4 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok and then
4 : that was your actions
2 : ok great
4 : so
1 : that's it
2 : mmhmmhmm
3 : uh you've got six treasure cards
2 : no this one doesn't count
3 : oh
3 : oh that's right
1 : oh that's her
3 : that's doh
2 : that's ok
2 : so we have whispering garden, lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon
4 : mm
2 : mm
4 : what was that?
1 : where is it?
3 : this
2 : cliffs of abandon. oh here it is.
1 : oh
1 : we're on it.
2 : damn
2 :  my turn.
4 : ok
2 : ok
4 : umm
3 : so
4 : your turn?
3 : my turn?
3 : ok
3 : you've got more of the ah water cards. i better give you uh the chalice.
4 : so
1 : yeah probably.
3 : so you can go four, ah four of a kind there.
1 : mmhmm. i just have to get rid of one.
3 : and probably umm
3 : i don't want whispering garden to sink
3 : so umm
3 : i'm gonna head over there as my pilot's uh
3 : once per turn thing and then shore up whispering garden.
3 : i've taken three acitons.
3 : two cards, thank you very much. my two cards are these.
1 : alright
4 : and when we trade cards it's only one at a time right?
4 : cause
2 : can the messenger?
1 : yeah
3 : one or one or more actually, the rule card says
4 : w
4 : oh really?
1 : ok
4 : because
4 : i was gonna say maybe you should wait to move and
4 : because
2 : well you can
4 : my thought was like i would
4 : give these to you because like
4 : i, i have five cards right now and
3 : ah ok
1 : yeah
3 : ah i see
4 : i need to get rid of some so
3 : darn
3 : 
4 : but
1 : can you discard any card or does that have to be?
3 : any card i believe the rules ah
3 : say
3 : so
1 : ok
3 : now i did the treasure cards next thing three flood cards, three flood cards ah
2 : ok here's the flood.
3 : temple of the sun
3 : ah copper gate and crimson forest. i see crimson forest.
1 : ok copper gate's right below it.
3 : copper gate
3 : thank you
3 : these three go there and i think that is the end of my turn then.
2 : the other thing is is that he can
2 : also fly one of you guys with the card somewhere.
1 : oh ok
3 : you can use this at any time so uh
4 : ok
2 : yeah
4 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
3 : tell you what
2 : wait during your turn though or any time? during the game.
3 : does not count as an action so my understanding is uh
3 : at any time.
1 : yeah 
3 : not just your turn.
3 : it says ah on the rules.
4 : ok then that's good
1 : ok that's good.
3 : so
2 : mm
3 : so if umm one of your actions is going to umm
3 : yeah
4 : well
4 : just
4 : umm draw whatever cards you need and i think i know what i'm going to do so
3 : ok i, i, i'm done with my turn
1 : yeah
3 : so if
4 : umm
3 : if you want the helicopter lift you're welcome to it.
4 : so do i have to do that now or can i
3 : any time you want just ask for it and
1 : we could
4 : oh ok
1 : i'm just thinking
3 : doesn't count as an action.
1 : you give me the chalice and i just discard
1 : probably this one since it's not really in the pile and then we can use the helicopter lift to like
4 : yeah and i
1 : fly to it.
4 : yeah
4 : umm
4 : did you
4 : draw your
4 : water cards and what not yet cause i can't
3 : yeah we ah we got
1 : yeah
2 : yeah these are that
4 : oh ok
4 : oh duh, yeah we just did that
3 : those guys so i am done with my stuff
4 : ok umm so
4 : yeah and now that i'm with you i will just
4 : give you that
1 : alright so then i'll just discard this one
4 : umm
4 : i guess
4 : i want to shore something up
4 : which one do you think?
4 : is there one that
4 : seems more important than the other?
4 : at this point?
4 : cause i can do this
4 : that or that
2 : can't you do all three?
1 : you can do two right?
4 : no i can only
2 : oh
3 : mmhmm
4 : two
1 : yeah if you did the one you're standing on and then the one
4 : ok
1 : next to it?
4 : yeah we'll do that.
1 : or which ever one, either one.
4 : so that was two turns.
4 : right?
4 : and
1 : well you gave me a card so that counts as a turn.
4 : umm
3 : mmhmm
1 : so that was three.
4 : oh three.
1 : yeah
4 : yup
4 : ok water's rise and move it up a tick mark
2 : mmhmm that's good.
1 : sorry, i was trying to move this the other way, but it's taped.
4 : and
3 : ah umm shuffle, shuffle, shuffle don't dra oh ok.
4 : ok
1 : oh we have to forgot to shuffle them.
2 : oh meow
1 : umm
1 : try to shuffle them really good.
3 : so we
4 : three
3 : if we have to discard that then three.
4 : ok
4 : lost lagoon
4 : oops i don't know what i'm doing
4 : temple of the sun
2 : sunk
1 : goodbye
4 : and cliffs of abandon
4 : also sunk
4 : so you are swimming now
1 : oh
3 : uh yeah the other way
2 : ok i'm gonna
3 : so
2 : just go here guys.
3 : can you
2 : oh no i can't. i have to go adjacent.
3 : go d
1 : i don't think you can go diagnonal.
4 : no
3 : i think ah yeah
2 : ok so i'm just
2 : here
4 : yes
1 : ok
2 : so is it my turn? no. no. sorry
1 : so
1 : it's my turn. so should i just
1 : go one two and then claim it as three?
3 : sounds, sounds good. i don't see anything that desparately needs ah shoring up. that sounds like a great plan.
1 : two
2 : yeah
1 : alright, wait, wait what do i do with them when i claim it?
2 : yeah
3 : i guess we just keep it off to the side?
2 : we
4 : i think you need, don't you need all four? oh you do have four, sorry.
1 : yeah umm
3 : mmhmm
4 : i thought you had
4 : only had three
4 : never mind.
1 : oh discard pile
4 : so
1 : so i'll just stick them
3 : ok
1 : so i'll just keep that right there. oh ok
4 : whoo ooh
3 : yup
3 : yup we've
1 : so then i need umm
1 : yeah treasure card
4 : treasure cards and
1 : and then
1 : three of these
1 : so i got
1 : temple of the moon
1 : copper gate
1 : and
1 : breaker's bridge
1 : ah copper gate is a goner
2 : copper gate's down
3 : sunk
4 : ok we can't let temple of the moon sink because
3 : yeah
4 : uh
4 : it has one of those
3 : so
4 : the one of the ones we lost already
3 : is ah copper gate card ah
1 : oh yeah
3 : cause this got sunk just now.
1 : there you go
3 : copper gate is gone.
1 : alright so that's your turn.
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : what did  temple of the moon you said?
1 : yeah
2 : should i shore up ah  yeah so i can
2 : can i do that, cause it's diagonal? i can only do that adjacent right?
1 : let's see here
4 : for sandbag
3 : say what does what does the card say. shore up any one tile at the island, does not count as an action.
1 : oh doesn't count as an action.
2 : so i'm gonna do this
3 : good idea. good idea.
2 : that's not an action
2 : and now that i'm gonna do this which actually
2 : counts as an action
1 : ok that's one
2 : that's two
2 : one
2 : and then
2 : so i can give these
2 : who's blue?
2 : oh
3 : i'm pi pilot
2 : shh ok should i give
4 : umm i don't know if it might be better
3 : ah
4 : like
2 : about to just give it to y
4 : i have two already but
1 : yeah
4 : so
2 : but where
1 : if
1 : we'd have to wait one more time around
2 : yeah so
4 : yeah we'd have to wait just because
1 : cause you'd to give me both of yours and then on
3 : so i tell you what do you have to actions left?
4 : yeah
1 : ah next term?
1 : yeah maybe we should shore up
3 : if
3 : if you have two actions
3 : ah
3 : here's here's what i'd recommend.
4 : you could move and then shore up
3 : i'd recommend you could move
3 : one action
3 : pass off two of the ah
3 : yellow uh treasure cards
2 : i can only do one then my two actions was gonna give
3 : actually
2 : to to someone
1 : well
4 : well the problem is i have too many cards so like
1 : you can't
3 : one or m one or
3 : yeah
4 : that's
1 : yes
2 : umm
1 : if we wait one more time around then we'll be able to do it.
4 : like
4 : i would just ah
3 : ok
4 : move one shore up
4 : that would be your
3 : ok ok
4 : final
1 : that's what i would yeah i think that would be a better idea
4 : and then
4 : draw your treasure cards
4 : ok that's good
2 : so i can get rid of this?
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : can i use it?
3 : ah yeah i think that's what that's what it says. treasure yeah treasure card
1 : that doesn't count as a turn. i guess you can use it.
3 : two actions cards.
2 : yeah
4 : yeah so
2 : so flip it over
4 : alright
4 : well that's good.
2 : ok
2 : woo
1 : yay
2 : your turn
3 : so did you do
1 : oh wait you have to do the
4 : ah
3 : flood
4 : flood cards too
2 : ok whispering garden 
2 : it's over there.
2 : ah crimson forest and
2 : dunes of deception
1 : crimson
2 : crimson forest
1 : that's up there
3 : ok my turn, i'm blue
2 : ok
3 : probably two things best to do is shore up the two
3 : i'm near right now
1 : yeah probably good idea
4 : ok so
3 : so i'm just, ah thanks, thanks, thanks.
3 : i got one more action.
2 : you should maybe give me
2 : or
2 : yeah
3 : unfortunately
1 : well then you have too many cards
3 : tell you what
2 : oh yeah
3 : i could
2 : hold on
3 : hold on that
2 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : i was thinking of like you fly me but that would have been later.
2 : umm
4 : umm
3 : tell, tell you what, i'm gonna need
1 : 
2 : so is it
4 : if
3 : eventually i'm gonna need to pass off maybe a black ah card to one of you guys.
1 : yeah well i'm trying to see. if she gives me her two purple then she can give her
4 : so
1 : two yellow so those will all be
1 : out of the way
4 : so yeah right now i need to be close
1 : so maybe if you
4 : to like so one of my turns will be
4 : move next to her.
1 : mmhmm
4 : the second one
3 : you need, you need to move us
4 : or wait
4 : you
4 : so can you move her to any
4 : spot with that
3 : i can move any anybody so
4 : like
4 : could you move her
4 : to me?
3 : let's do that
4 : that way i don't have to use one of my turns.
1 : yeah that works.
3 : and i've got ah
3 : one more space
1 : that's p
4 : and like that didn't count as a turn for you so
2 : we'll use that later.
1 : oh yeah it didn't count
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah maybe we should save them.
3 : ah now i don't want to be on the edge of the board if those uh if those guys sink.
1 : yeah so just fly over.
3 : so i'm
4 : umm
4 : oh wait how many turns do you have left?
3 : i got one one action, i have not used my pilot move
4 : just one ok
2 : yeah you
3 : so i want to uh
2 : yeah you shh
3 : might as well head over here.
4 : ok
3 : i've taken three actions
3 : now i draw two treasure deck cards uh
3 : treasure deck.
3 : k
1 : now wait, wait see
2 : and hopefully no water rise ok.
1 : ok good.
3 : well and
4 : good
3 : i got a tough choice here.
1 : i would discard one of the purple ones because we're not gonna need it.
4 : yeah like
3 : ok hmm hmm
4 : assuming nothing goes too bad
3 : ok so i have i've done the card stuff, now the ah water stuff. what do we have here?
4 : right now what should we do
3 : cave of shadows, tidal palace, silver gate
3 : that's cave of shadows, silver palace
1 : silver gate
3 : tidal palace
1 : tidal
1 : ok
4 : ok so
3 : thank you very much.
4 : two of them are treasure cards.
1 : mmhmm
3 : i'm done.
4 : so
4 : alright umm
4 : i guess
4 : so if i want to give both of these to you
4 : that's two turns
3 : actually one turn it says uh you may give one or more your treasure cards to another player.
4 : oh
3 : oh s hold
4 : ok
3 : it costs one action for each card, i'm sorry. it really, it really is that i'm sorry.
1 : ok that's fine.
4 : yeah
4 : well
1 : s
4 : i will just
4 : i'll give two of these so that's two turns and then shore up that. does that sound good?
1 : yup
3 : perfect, perfect.
1 : i think that's a good idea.
4 : oh ok
4 : and there's that

2 : fly everyone
1 : should you
1 : fly us all to
4 : umm
3 : i can move from one tile to another tile
4 : so you can, you have, they have to be on the same, so you can move us there.

3 : so we're we so the moment
3 : we could we could win this on your turn, ah ah ah can we do that?
1 : we can just win it now.
3 : all all of us have to get to fool's landing
2 : yeah
4 : well you could fly
4 : yeah just
2 : just
2 : just
4 : so you fly us to there
4 : we need one in the end though
1 : you can use your pilot move
4 : right
1 : yeah i have two
4 : ok so
1 : so if you use your pilot move
3 : i fly i fly
1 : fly there then use your card, fly both of them
4 : he's
4 : well he used three already
3 : ok
4 : cause he
1 : oh
3 : yeah one
4 : capture the treasure. i think that's
1 : i see
3 : shore up, i've used my three actions already
1 : i see ok
3 : so
3 : let me just, just get my turn finished, see what floods
2 : well it's coming back
4 : well
4 : that doesn't count as an action though so
3 : mmhmm
4 : if you want to
4 : move us now you could but
4 : i guess if you could play it at any time it doesn't matter
4 : i
4 : umm
2 : but we
2 : have three we should play play all of the helicopter
3 : yeah, yeah, mmhmm i, i can get myself over on my turn i'm afraid, unless we get a helicopter card.
2 : cards
1 : yeah
3 : so the rest of you
2 : oh
2 : oh you need to be on the same, ok
3 : rest, rest
1 : mmhmm
3 : rest of you, rest of you guys
4 : yeah
3 : now
3 : ok
4 : unless
3 : ah
3 : tell you, i'll tell you what
4 : mm
4 : unless you want to wait
4 : until her turn, she moves there
4 : and then
4 : move all three of us at one time, i don't know
1 : but yeah unless like because we still have to pick all of the flooding cards, so i don't know if anything would flood.
3 : good idea.
4 : yeah
4 : like
4 : so do you think we should just
3 : tell
3 : tell yah
4 : draw cards take my turn
3 : tell ya, tell ya what, tell ya what
3 : we can go helicopter lift here
3 : you helicopter lift you three there
3 : and you'll have to wait till it comes around to my turn and then we could probably win this.
4 : ok
3 : sound like a good plan?
4 : yeah so you'll have to draw treasure cards
2 : mmhmm
4 : before we do anything
1 : should i do it now or
3 : ah
