2 : oh boy
2 : alright
1 : ok so
2 : so first you draw
1 : three
4 : do your actions yeah
1 : yes.
2 : yeah your actions and then you draw.
1 : ok, first action is to move right?
3 : first actions yes.
2 : so
4 : or whatever you want.
3 : if you want to yeah.
2 : or you can shore up.
1 : ahhh
4 : you might yeah, you might want to cause there's like four
2 : i think we should try to keep these.
1 : oh
2 : as unflooded as possible because we're gonna have to go to these ones.
1 : ok
2 : in order to like actually get the
1 : so you want these two up?
4 : yeah you should definitely shore up one of them cause there's so many.
3 : correct.
2 : those so yeah. you can dis i would, you can do two right? isn't that your special power?
1 : yeah i can do two, so i can do this one and this one.
4 : you could do three.
3 : mmhmm.
2 : yeah cause you want to keep it as unflooded as possible probably so that we don't lose tiles.
1 : yeah.
3 : to ensure optimum mobility yes.
2 : yeah.
1 : ok.
2 : so
4 : can't you
1 : so
2 : you could move there and then do another two.
4 : or couldn't you even just shore up more if you wanted to?
2 : oh wait
1 : would that be
2 : can you only
2 : shore up one, two tiles once.
4 : for one.
2 : shore up.
1 : i am not sure.
3 : shore up two tiles for one action doesn't say that it's limited to one once per turn.
1 : yeah it doesn't say, so i think that was just one action.
4 : umm yeah i'm pretty sure you can do whatever you want cause you can move more then you want to and it would just count as more of an option.
2 : one time.
2 : yeah.
3 : so you could shore up to six tiles in an
3 : well no, cause you would have to move.
1 : ok so now this is my second action if i move here and then do these two.
2 : yeah.
4 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
3 : third action.
2 : and we also have to make sure fool's landing doesn't sink cause we need to use that to get out obviously.
4 : ok, that's good
1 : that's a little bit important yeah.
2 : umm, and then.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : ok.
1 : umm take
4 : take two cards.
1 : two of those.
2 : unless you want to do a third thing.
1 : i can do a third thing.
4 : didn't you already do that?
2 : she, flipped two. oh you moved, you moved. yeah, you're right you're right.
4 : you flipped two, moved, flipped two.
3 : no you move flip two, moved, flip two.
3 : we're good.
1 : ok.
1 : ok.
2 : oh no, water's rise.
1 : ok so this is going up.
2 : so
2 : this will go in the discard here.
2 : and then i'll shuffle these for you.
1 : and breaker's bridge.
2 : you have to do two, because you're 
1 : oh yeah sorry.
1 : breaker's bridge and gold gate.
2 : uh gold gate, so gold gate sinks.
1 : ok, that was quick.
2 : and, ah that's ok.
3 : mmhmm.
3 : so i get the gold gate
3 : card gets
1 : yeah
2 : oh yeah that has to go out, you're right.
3 : withdrawn from play as well.
2 : and that's the end of your turn.
1 : mmhmm.
4 : yup.
2 : so my turn.
2 : where am i, i'm over here. umm
2 : well,
2 : since i'm the messenger i can like.
2 : give cards to anywhere.
1 : mmhmm.
2 : and i have this one and you also have that so i'm
2 : gonna give that to you cause then you'll have two.
4 : ok.
2 : umm
2 : and
2 : then
2 : i don't know, should i like move?
1 : you're gray right? umm
2 : yeah
1 : at this point i feel like there's no way of knowing which one of these are going to come up next cause almost all of them are
2 : yeah i mean i can start to
4 : yeah, you don't really have to move.
3 : i'd just start heading towards you know
2 : i can start heading towards down here, because they have these three and i have one of those.
1 : mmhmm.
1 : true.
2 : i guess so i can
3 : mmhmm.
2 : second, third.
1 : mmhmm.
3 : yup.
2 : ok umm and then i
2 : draw two
4 : two of those cards yeah.
2 : treasure cards
2 : umm ok i got a sandbag's and another one. so then like my next turn i can give that to you again.
4 : ok yeah. or if
3 : and i'll have three of those.
2 : umm and then you'll have three.
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm.
2 : and then
4 : or i can move to you too and oh no never mind, i guess, no cause you can give it to me.
2 : oh yeah, that's another
2 : umm
2 : and then i don't have to do the flood thing
4 : no you do, you still do.
3 : no you do.
1 : you do, yeah.
2 : wait i do? oh, you still do that even if you don't get
3 : yeah
2 : the water's rise just means that the level goes up, ok.
1 : yeah.
2 : wait no first
2 : do i shuffle?
4 : no no you just
2 : that water ok i'm sorry
3 : well you s
4 : yeah
1 : no, no it's fine
3 : no you still p
3 : put that back on the
3 : right?
4 : no i think only if you get that's like that's why it's a bad card because
1 : no this
2 : i think that's only with water's rise.
3 : no.
3 : it's only if the water ok.
1 : if it floods, yeah.
2 : ok.
2 : so two
1 : mmhmm.
2 : lost lagoon and phantom rock.
1 : this one's gone.
3 : and phantom rock's gone
2 : oh ok, so
3 : that's ok
2 : there's that.
4 : ok
2 : umm
1 : that's it for you i think.
2 : and then i'm done, so
4 : it's your turn, yep
3 : mmhmm.
2 : alright
3 : it's to me
3 : then i can move
2 : i mean
3 : anywhere in that
3 : yeah that counts as an action but i can only do it once per turn.
2 : you could go
3 : yeah
2 : and try and shore up some of those
1 : you can always
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah
3 : i could. umm
3 : seems
3 : seems to be the only viable thing, actually
4 : 
2 : yeah for now i think we're just trying to stay afloat
3 : so yeah
3 : move over here and then i will shore up
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok
3 : this one, and third action shore up that one.
2 : shore up that one?
2 : ok
2 : and then you have to draw two.
3 : draw two
4 : your two cards.
2 : ok good. so we have a helicop you have two of them, that's good
3 : so i got a helicopter lift and
3 : uh fires
4 : maybe
4 : maybe your next turn
1 : oh hey
2 : ok
2 : yeah, so you'll
4 : probably, yeah
2 : just like
2 : keep in mind who we can shift to
2 : umm and then
3 : mmhmm
2 : have to draw two
1 : wait can he give me that? or can only you do that?
3 : mm
2 : he can, but he has to be on the same tile.
4 : he already
4 : he did it as a
1 : oh right, ok
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah, i think that counts as an action too, so
2 : so
1 : mmhmm
2 : it yeah, so i mean, possibly next turn.
2 : depending
3 : depending on where we move
3 : alright, whispering garden and cliffs of abandon
4 : no you should try to move 
2 : umm
3 : which is whispering?
3 : howling garden, whhispering garden
2 : umm where are
3 : so there and
1 : and here, this one
2 : oh, ok.
3 : cliffs of abandon
1 : both of us, now we're sinking
4 : ok
2 : oh no, alright.
4 : alright
4 : umm
2 : there's those two
2 : and that's it for you? alright. so
3 : yup
4 : uh ok so
2 : you could
2 : you could
4 : i mean i
2 : trade him
2 : the lion card?
2 : oh wait no you
1 : wait
1 : you can move diagonally which means you can go here and get
2 : oh
4 : yeah.
1 : that.
1 : if you
4 : well i have to get like the card don't i? so i
2 : yeah you have to get four cards before you can do that.
1 : oh
4 : yeah so maybe i might as well just, cause i can flip diagonally so
4 : i could flip those both over
2 : ok so you can shore up this one?
4 : i don't know, yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : well yeah, you could shore up this one and then like move
4 : i guess
4 : i guess at this point there's nothing else to do really.
2 : until we get like the right cards
2 : you know, to start moving towards these.
2 : umm
3 : you could move to
3 : temple of the moon if like
4 : ok so that was one
3 : 
3 : so take a diagonal action
4 : two
2 : you could do that and then three, shore up that one
4 : ok
4 : hmm
2 : i mean, i don't really
4 : yeah i guess no one really has
2 : have a better idea.
2 : i think we're just waiting to get the tr
4 : oh yeah
2 : like right amount of treasure cards
4 : can you
2 : ok so
4 : give me two?
2 : yup.
3 : hmm 
4 : ok
2 : ok and you have five
4 : yeah
2 : so
2 : we'll have to be
3 : any more cards has to be
4 : yup
3 : discarded.
2 : yeah, so we'll have to be mindful of that. and then
2 : two
4 : temple of the moon and iron gate
2 : ok.
2 : oh, no no
1 : wait
2 : those go back over here
4 : ok
1 : oh right here
3 : mmhmm
4 : it's your turn.
2 : ok.
1 : ok
1 : it's weird i keep expecting to like roll a dice, but ok
2 : i know
2 : right?
1 : umm
4 : you're red.
2 : you're red, so
1 : so anything, really
1 : i can go here
2 : yeah you're and then
1 : and then
2 : there and
2 : flip that.
1 : yeah, ok. so one, two
4 : or ok.
2 : one, two, three.
1 : three
1 : thank you
2 : ok
2 : oh no
1 : no!
2 : level three
1 : so
1 : and then shuffle these right?
3 : mmhmm
3 : it's
2 : yeah
3 : discard water's rise too.
2 : yeah. here i'll take that, you shuffle those
1 : oh yeah
2 : ok and then draw three
1 : ok breaker's bridge
1 : umm cliffs of abandon
4 :  so we can move them faster
1 : and whispering garden
3 : which is over there, yeah.
2 : ok
2 : and then put those there, and then
4 : ok where are you, ok
2 : that's it?
1 : that's it
2 : ok, so
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah you might wanna
2 : i can shh
4 : flip over at least that one, maybe.
2 : yeah
3 : you get the sandbag that you can shore
2 : yeah but i might as well save that for now
3 : to any
3 : well yeah, any tile on the island. you're right
2 : y yeah
2 : well, or i could
3 : while you're, while you're
2 : flip it for that
2 : cause we know
3 : well while you're, while you're adjacent you might as well not.
2 : yeah, so
4 : yeah, i wouldn't waste that.
2 : flip that and then i could flip this one too cause i'm on it
4 : that's one
4 : or, ok well, yeah
2 : or, do you think i should move somewhere?
3 : either
3 : be
4 : i guess, i don't know. we should probably start trying to
3 : get treasure
1 : get
4 : do something other than
2 : yeah.
4 : but i guess you don't really have any cards anyway, so.
3 : well you wanted to, hmm
2 : umm
2 : and
3 : i was gonna say you wanted to trade some of that but,
2 : yeah, but then she doesn't have
2 : i could trade
3 : yeah we don't want to put, yeah.
4 : ok, where are you? where are you
2 : you one of these, but you already have the
2 : red fire ones, so i'm thinking she can trade you
4 : alright
1 : yeah
4 : yeah. i'll move, i'll move to you and give you, umm, my card on my turn.
2 : yeah.
1 : ok
2 : the next turn
2 : umm, and then ne
4 : and you should where are you at?
3 : i'm the
3 : blue guy, way over there.
4 : oh.
4 : i was gonna say, cause you should give her
2 : cause
2 : yeah. if you give her a fire, and she gives her a fire she'll have
4 : a card.
2 : four, and then you could discard one that wouldn't really matter.
1 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, true.
2 : you know?
2 : umm, ok.
4 : or we could wait a whole nother time around, but
2 : should i, move like down?
2 : i guess
1 : yeah why not
2 : ok.
2 : so that's that turn, umm
2 : another one of those, and another sandbag. so i'm full on cards.
2 : and i have to do three
2 : so iton gate, so that's now sunk, and there's that card. temple of the moon
4 : you could even, where are you at?
2 : and lost lagoon.
1 : i'm here.
4 : where is the fire one? oh you're kinda far
4 : no mm
1 : what were you thinking?
4 : i was gonna say, you could use your helicopter and give her that and then i could give her it
3 : somebody can move
4 : but
1 : that's true.
4 : she wouldn't you're so far away from like the fire anyways so
1 : mmhmm
2 : well
2 : if you did that, one, two, three
3 : i could move her to the fire
4 : yeah but then she it
4 : takes a card to oh true.
2 : you could move her to the fire
3 : i could move her to the fire thing and then give
2 : w
4 : and then you could move yourself and then give her one
2 : and you can do that on her turn cause that's used any time right?
4 : give
2 : ok, so then
4 : yeah.
4 : well, he, that's also his power too, so
2 : ok so then why don't you fly to her
2 : and give her the fire
2 : one of them
4 : wait
2 : so she
3 : yeah
4 : you, why are you moving? do you have
2 : because, he's the pilot s o he can
4 : you have to be on the same card to give ok.
3 : yeah i can
2 : yeah, so he can move to her
3 : yeah, to give cards i can
2 : i'm the only one who can give to anybody, and then
4 : ok that's one move.
2 : two would be giving her that
3 : mmhmm
3 : yep
3 : yeah to red fire. that's right
1 : mmhmm.
2 : yep
2 : and that gives you five
1 : yeah.
2 : but, if she gives you the other one, just get rid of another one
4 : yeah.
1 : discard one of these, yeah
2 : umm, and then
3 : mmhmm, and then i can do
3 : helicopter lift to take
2 : to move her
2 : both of you
3 : both of us to fire.
2 : so, either cave of shadows or,
4 : yeah that's good
2 : ok yeah, that's good.
4 : alright so
2 : so then, draw two
3 : and then i draw two
3 : two more treasure cards.
4 : and three
2 : ok
3 : and then three
3 : of these guys.
3 : which is copper gate, crimson forest
4 : yeah
4 : what's the other one? just cause we're being timed
3 : crimson
3 : and howling garden.
2 : ok.
4 : ok, so
4 : where am i? here?
4 : i guess i'll one, two, give you a card
1 : ok
2 : ok.
4 : everyone agree with that?
2 : yeah.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yup.
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then give her the fire and then you can get rid of
1 : do i have to get rid of one randomly? or can i get rid of whichever i want?
3 : is to discard
2 : yeah
4 : yeah i guess just there's so many so i wouldn't
2 : i think, it doesn't matter i don't think. he can pick which one.
4 : i think you can pick
1 : ok
2 : ok, so
4 : umm, yeah i guess that
2 : so then yeah, now you have four
4 : probably be the best one to get rid of
4 : although, oh well whatever.
1 : mmhmm
3 : and so now i'm
2 : so then now get rid of all four of those and
1 : so
3 : seizes a treasure
2 : do you
2 : yeah and then you get that one, i think.
3 : mmhmm
1 : yay!
4 : umm that was only
2 : alright.
1 : and then
4 : that was only one move right?
3 : yeah, to dis yeah
2 : yep.
1 : i
4 : you should oh you can't flip
1 : ok.
1 : lathough it's not
4 : hmm
1 : is it my was that my turn?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah, so like
1 : ok.
2 : seize a treasure
1 : ok.
2 : capture a treasure, yeah that's one move.
4 : yeah, maybe move and then flip one of those over just cause, i don't know
1 : ok.
4 : what else
2 : yeah, or
1 : umm,
2 : if you move here
2 : oh no you can't
2 : do
2 : diagonal flipping
1 : nnhmm
2 : but you could still flip one of em.
1 : yeah
4 : whichever yeah
2 : you know like flip baper breaker's bridge back over or something.
1 : i can just do
1 : ok
4 : that's good so, two cards
3 : and then draw
2 : ok.
2 : umm
3 : 
2 : yeah, draw two
3 : oh yay
1 : every time
2 : it's ok we're still on three, so
2 : and
1 : and then
2 : shuffle
1 : yeah
2 : nd put the water's rise card in the discard.
4 : i guess you might as well discard the fire one too since we don't need it anymore.
4 : just so you're empty you've
1 : that's true
3 : yep
2 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : ok
1 : whispering garden
1 : temple of the moon and lost lagoon.
2 : oh no! alright
2 : so we'll have to make sure temple of the sun doesn't sink cause that's the only other
3 : temple of the moon
4 : ok
2 : umm chalice one
1 : oh wait and lost lagoon, did we get that one?
2 : or
2 : earth globe or whatever it was
2 : l
3 : wait what was the third one?
4 : yeah, yeah.
1 : lost lagoon? oh, bye bye
2 : well l-lost
2 : ok so that sinks also
3 : lost lagoon.
4 : oh i
3 : then i need
3 : lost lagoon in the
2 : oh, yeah
1 : yeah.
3 : alright
3 : good.
2 : there you go
1 : wasn't there another one that sank?
2 : ok.
2 : yeah.
2 : oh
3 : temple of the moon
4 : you already got it
2 : sorry.
2 : alright.
3 : yep
2 : umm, that's it
2 : and i have two sandbag cards, do you want me to play any of those? cause both of these are
4 : yeah probably
3 : dan in danger, yeah.
2 : do you want me to just do one or both of them?
2 : or maybe save one if we really need it
3 : do
4 : umm
1 : mm
1 : save one , i think
2 : ok.
4 : i mean, yeah.
2 : ok, so i guess i'll just do whispering
2 : garden cause we're closer to that.
2 : and, umm
4 : so that's one turn, right?
2 : so that's one, yeah.
2 : wait no because that doesn't count as it
4 : wait no it's not, it's not, it's not, yeah
2 : ok.
2 : so
2 : is there any reason for me
1 : you can start heading that way.
2 : like i could do, one, two, flip that
1 : yeah
2 : i guess.
4 : yeah maybe, or, ok.
2 : and three.
4 : i was gonna say, alright that's fine.
4 : no that's fine. i was gonna say maybe, i mean you're still close to that.
2 : do you have, that's good
2 : cause i wanna stay close to these. umm ok so then draw two
4 : yeah
4 : just cause you have
2 : which
2 : i'm not gonna be able to keep
3 : no you just
4 : yeah
4 : i mean
3 : you
3 : one
2 : or wait or should i tr
1 : you have four, you only have four right now.
4 : yeah, no she has six.
4 : what are those two?
2 : helicopter lift
1 : but you can just discard whichever you don't wannt
4 : yeah, just
4 : does it add
4 : yeah.
4 : i'd discard maybe
4 : the chalice since i have two of these
2 : ok
4 : but do you guys agree with that?
1 : sure it looks like we're about equal with both of them
2 : yeah, on them
3 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : umm and then
4 : aw man
2 : three
4 : ok, i was gonna say
4 : cause i could
2 : i should've traded you
2 : like
2 : cause i'm the messenger and i don't have to be on the same tile, i could've traded you some of
4 : oh.
2 : or one of my
3 : send one of these over, yeah.
4 : oh do you not have any, ok yeah.
2 : i don't know if we're allowed to back track
4 : but i don't think just go ahead.
2 : yeah, ok. one, two, three
2 : howling gardens
2 : oh good, cause i just flipped that back over
3 : 
4 : cool.
2 : umm, breaker's bridge, cliffs of abandon
2 : breaker's bridge ok good.
3 : breaker's bridge
2 : alright. next
3 : alright
4 : hmm
3 : ok, umm
2 : i mean you can trade her either one of these
2 : or one of those
2 : if you get on the same
3 : right. well i am
4 : and that's good if cause she can give it to me at any time, so
2 : then i can give you, and then so which one do we wanna do?
4 : where are you at?
3 : well actually yeah. i could, i could go, i could go to her and no i'm, i'm on her, so yeah.
4 : you're the blue, ok
2 : yeah
2 : so
4 : i'm green, i'm blue so yeah that works good
2 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
3 : so i can already
2 : yeah so that's one
3 : s
3 : give
3 : one
2 : and then
3 : and then i can move some where to save something i suppose
4 : yeah that's probably a good idea
2 : yeah, umm
2 : do you wanna
2 : ugh
3 : and then i could move somebody else with the course that doesn't, yeah it doesn't count as an action. i keep forgetting that
1 : if you moved here you could get both of those
2 : except he can't do two, you're the only one who can.
1 : oh, never mind.
2 : but
2 : you could still move here and do one of those two
3 : i could move
2 : or you can move anywhere
4 : we should probably try to we should probably try to stay close together though just with exchanging cards i mean we don't need this, we don't really need it so
2 : yeah
2 : just because with changing cards and we're close to all of these
2 : yeah
2 : so maybe like, get one of these because that's the path to
4 : and
2 : that
4 : yeah
3 : i guess so
2 : ok
3 : sounds ok
3 : so move here and then
2 : and then shh
4 : wait you can't move diagonal
2 : he can because he's the pilot so he can fly
3 : yeah, i can fly wherever
2 : he has one turn, yeah.
3 : as a
4 : oh that counts as a trun
3 : as a flight yeah as a flight move not a
2 : yeah so that's a flight
