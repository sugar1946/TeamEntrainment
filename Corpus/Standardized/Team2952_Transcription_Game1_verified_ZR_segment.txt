1 : ok
1 : so that's two actions
3 : two or three?
1 : right
3 : i think that you shored up the one, or can you shore up more than one?
1 : i can shore that's my special powers these two
3 : ah ok i gotcha
1 : i'll shore up this ones as well
1 : uh
1 : i draw. can you pass me two deck cards please?
2 : mmhmm
1 : thank you
1 : k so one of them is the water rise
1 : so
1 : that is sunk.
1 : this goes with that
2 : my turn
1 : now it's your turn i think, yup.
2 : yup
2 : so i can take up to three actions, move, shore up,
2 : give a treasure card
2 : capture a treasure
2 :  flooded tile
2 : ok so
2 : umm
2 : shore up
2 : 
2 :  action shore up
2 : for the other  shore up
2 : simply flip it over so it's unflooded 
2 : so i have to take an adjacent one right?
1 : yeah, no, none of your adjacent cards are flooded.
2 : none of them. so that doesn't help, ok.
2 : give a treasure card
2 : you may give a treasure card
2 : to another player if both your pawns are on the same no that doesn't help
1 : although your special power is that you can give them anywhere
2 : oh yeah thanks
1 : mmhmm
2 : your treasure  to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card
2 : so i can let's see
2 : messenger can give a single card to anyone anywhere when it is her turn but may not be on the same tile
2 : hmm
2 :  treasure
2 : can i take two of these?
2 : 
1 : yeah, yeah, i guess you don't have to use all of your actions yeah
3 : yeah
2 : yeah if i can't use all the actions, i mean sometimes you can't right?
1 : right
2 : shore up any tile on the island
3 : oh that's a sandbag
3 : uh shore, shoring up
2 : oh
3 : would be you, you just flooded it out, you have to
1 : yeah
2 : oh, that means turning it over right? i don't wanna
3 : yeah
3 : turning it over if it's blue.
2 : oh yeah
3 :  flooding
2 : ok
2 : discard a treasure discard pile
3 : k so i'm up
1 : umm
1 : do you have to draw flood cards?
3 : oh should i just draw flood cards too?
1 : yeah
2 : two of them.
2 : where is that card?
3 : s
3 : you find find the corresponding island card and flip it over
3 : so it's flooded and blue becomes blue
2 : sorry it'll take me a minute
3 : that's fine i'll help you out. lost lagoon
2 : ok
2 : yeah lost lagoon, let's see
1 : and here, so that one's done.
3 : that one, that one goes away
2 : ok, so we take that one and cliffs of abandon
3 : i'll take, i'll take that card too.
2 : ok
3 : yeah
2 : cliffs of abandon and
2 : that was that one.
3 : oh lost lagoon oops wrong one, wrong one.
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : cliffs of abandon, there we go.
3 : cliffs of
3 : cliffs of abandon
2 : and we wanna turn this one around
3 : right there
3 : flipped yeah
2 : take this one
3 : there we go
2 : and that one goes
3 : let's put that on the
3 : discard pile there.
2 : ok
3 : ok now we're gonna
3 : this
3 : can i shore up one that's on
3 : another one is on it
1 : what was the question?
3 : if someone's on that can i, can i shore that up?
1 : uh yeah i think so
3 : ok
3 : that's two actions.
2 : so we don't want any umm
3 : umm
2 : flood showing, right?
2 : we don't want any of the other side
3 : that can go to a different one i guess.
1 : it'll make it easier to move around the board if they don't
1 : sink.
3 : 
3 : umm
3 : so if something was red do i get that one there?
3 : take up to three actions. is this the third action?
3 : right uh
1 : or did you fly and then shore up two
3 : i flew, i flew, shored up
3 : oh, i flew and then i shored up. oh there we go, never mind.
3 : ah i gotcha ok
3 : and then i get
3 : two treasure cards.
3 : alright
3 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : i get two
3 : flood cards
3 : i think.
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : so breaker's bridge
3 :  find breaker's bridge or phantom rock.
2 : breaker's bridge
3 : phantom rock and
3 : breaker's bridge.
3 : breaker's bridge, breaker's bridge.
3 : there it is.
1 : good
1 : ok
1 : do you think i can give you
1 : two of these in one action?
3 : uh
3 : i uh i don't know.
3 : i mean i uh i can give you two in mine
1 : well what i'm thinking i'll do is move to your tile and then give you two of these as a second action cause since you already have one.
3 : sure, yeah.
1 : uh
1 : give you those.
3 : ok
1 : uh we can always change them i think you hang on to these.
3 : i don't
3 : hang on to them ok
1 : yeah although
3 : ok i gotcha
1 : i might give you more than five huh?
2 : yeah if you have six yeah you have to. it says only have five
3 : oh yeah that's more than five, yeah
3 : yeah
1 : how many do you have there?
2 : if you have six
3 : i have six five wait no i got no i got six, yeah.
1 : six
3 : uh i guess i give one away then i can't do it on my action or
1 : i wonder which one you must discard
3 : do i i have to discard one i'll discard lift
3 : or
3 : i'll discard this guy.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah this guy's better
3 : discard it
3 : right over here. actually never mind.
1 : and then
1 : i will shore up this one with my third action.
3 : and that one's already shored up
1 : uh
3 : it just looks blue.
1 : it just doesn't 
2 : no it was blue and white.
1 : i said it was that one huh?
3 : yeah
3 :  maybe the, the key is that safe is white on the bottom, maybe
2 : ah yeah
3 : isn't the blue the blue  is misleading.
1 : umm
1 : yeah.
1 : two of these
3 : oh yeah
2 : hey my turn?
2 : ok let's see
2 : draw two treasure deck cards
2 :  move yourself.
2 : are there any next to me? nope
2 : uh yeah this one right?
2 : turn this one over?
2 : ok, capture treasure, can't do that
2 : let's see
3 : 
2 : what's that?
3 : water's rice
3 : move it up one
2 : yeah i have to use that one
2 : shuffle this right?
2 : 
3 : no, no, no. that one goes in there i think and then
2 : what one
3 : no, no over here
2 : capture a treasure, can't do that.
1 :  let's throw these back on top.
3 : yeah
2 : k do i get one more action?
3 : i don't know how many that was
2 : i moved that one, i took two cards
1 : i think once you start drawing
1 : the treasure cards and then
1 :  that then you don't
1 : get any more actions. but umm
2 : oh that's it then.
1 : draw flood cards. draw three flood cards.
3 : three, yeah
2 : three.
3 : yeah
3 : i'll get that for you
2 : breaker's bridge
2 : that's sunk right?
3 : that's sunk yeah, so i'll take that.
2 : and phantom rock
3 : phantom rock's over here
3 : i'll put that on the pile there
3 :  uh
3 : fly over here
3 : and shore up this one
3 : and then
3 : get the treasure.
3 : or wait yeah trade
3 : 
3 : trade
3 : or, or i can't trade, i got to give
3 : uh
3 : guess i'll i'll just give you one
1 : i don't think you can give the special actions
3 : oh
3 : i can't give the special ones away? ok
1 : uh hang on to those
3 : yeah i'll let that go then.
3 :  too
3 : sandbags
3 : then i gotta get
3 : three.
3 : iron gate,
3 : whispering garden
3 : and temple to the, of the moon.
1 : why are you, why are you flooding them?
3 : because they theirs are the floods uh
3 : flood cards.
1 : oh, i'm sorry i thought you were still on the same moves.
3 : yeah
3 : what am i doing i can only one oh five cards in my hand, i got discard one.
3 : ok i guess i'll
3 : discard that.
1 : ok
1 : i'll give you this, i'll take one of them
3 : thank you
1 : this next move you should fly there.
3 : yeah
2 : yeah yeah
1 : uh ok ok
2 : oh they have to be standing on the same tile
3 : uh, ok
3 : darn
1 : i was thinking ahead to when you, when you were still back there
2 : this is confu confusing
1 : can i take back moves?
1 : do you think i can take back moves?
2 : it doesn't say
1 : what if i were to
1 : shore this one up and then make the two moves that i made
1 : from as my three actions
2 : guess we have to think about it
1 : k
3 : mm
1 : for my first action, doing this
1 : then i'm doing that.
1 : ok
1 : messenger
2 : ok my turn.
2 : so what, what's like the best strategy like that i should do first?
1 : i wish i knew the answer to that one
3 : i don't, i don't know
2 : i know i'm trying to figure it i don't know. like i don't wanna take the cards yet
2 : move yourself
2 : one space.
2 : horizontal or vertical you can move onto a flooded tile.
2 : ok
2 : you could move a tile
2 : back to norm from flooded back to normal
2 : if it is adjacent ok, right
1 : yeah i think that would be a useful thing to do
3 : as an action, yeah
2 : that's one
2 : what do these things mean?
3 : that means that
3 : something
3 : i don't know
3 : i don't know what the green one means.
2 : ok so i can move that, or i shored
2 : shored up
2 : move yourself to another island tile
1 : i think that's just where we began
1 : the little icon.
3 : oh, i thought well, eh
2 : oh ok
1 : i started here
3 : oh, that makes sense yeah, cause you're green.
2 : ok
3 : or someone else is green
2 : now i can pick card
2 : right?
2 : draw two
2 : treasure deck cards
2 : ok
2 : oh how many do you have? three of those
3 : yeah
2 : can i give you one at anytime, doesn't it say as my power?
2 : give treasure cards to play anywhere on the island
2 : for one
2 : action card
3 : oh that's good
2 : so you would have four of those
1 : yeah yeah, i think you exhausted your actions for this  turn
3 : look at this card
2 : what's that?
1 : i think you exhausted your actions for this turn already. you have to wait until the next time around  from this one  my turn so
3 : i can discard
2 : oh ok
2 : ok
2 : can i have to use the water rise immediately. which one do you have to use immediately?
3 : yeah
2 : was there one?
1 : umm yeah the water rises if you just pulled that
2 : we put up one mark
3 : i have to give that back
3 : oh ok
2 : why
3 : i don't know
1 : did you just hand that one to the other one you just give to him yeah ok
3 : yeah
1 : umm
1 : guess it would
1 : count as an action.
2 : oh
1 : but
3 : can hold on for the next one?
2 : ok for the next time
1 : yeah so shuffle these
2 : and then
1 : and then pull from them.
3 : yeah
2 : what
2 : right?
1 : yeah 
3 : yeah we gotta move the ticker up. did we do that? yeah we did that
2 : , i'm trying to learn
2 : what's that?
3 : never mind
2 : ok
1 : and then pull three flood cards
2 : ok, whispering garden
3 : oh
1 : umm
2 : 
2 : copper gate
3 : copper gate yeah, i'll take that
2 : and crimson forest
3 : there we go
3 : k
3 : uh
1 : i think you should fly to me so i can give you one of these on my next turn
3 : sounds like a plan
3 : and i, can i i don't know if i can do this diagonally
1 : you're the pilot
2 : it's just diagonal
1 : you're the pilot
1 : you can fly anywhere
2 : uh that's right
3 : oh yeah i might as well flip that
1 : ok
3 : for my first action i think, cause i'm on it
1 : yeah
3 : and then go to there.
3 : and then uh, or, wait no
3 : second action.
3 : this third action
3 : and then
3 : that alright or no?
1 : uh not diagonal
3 : shore up, you can flip an island tile from flooded back to normal
1 : but
2 : if you're on it or adjacent
3 : if you are adjacent to it
1 : yeah ok
3 : i was adjacent, or no i wasn't, never mind it was diagonally yeah
1 : diagonal
3 : ah ok so
3 : i'll just uh
3 : then i'll just pick treasures.
3 : uh
3 : that's an action pick a, pick a treasure then an action, yeah
3 : oh wait, that's after i give away my action ok
3 : dump
3 : 
3 : is that a 
3 : or
3 : can i give that away?
3 : well i have it in my hand, i can't give it away, no i can't
3 : discard
3 : discard
3 : and then
3 : yeah, i guess that's uh that's right, yeah
1 : and then three
1 : yeah, yeah, 
2 : three of them
3 : three
3 : uh iron gate,
3 : temple of the moon,
3 : and cliffs of abandon
3 : there we go
1 : ok, my first action
3 : k
3 : yeah
2 : beat me to that one
1 : can you get this now
3 : perfect
1 : and
1 : second action
3 : or no i have four, i only have four.
2 : you need five we need five of them
3 : i need five, i need a fifth one
1 : can you draw five then?
3 : she's got, she's got the last one
2 : oh ok, so my turn i'll give it
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : k, so you have to use an action, you have to use an ac
3 : oh wait no, four matching no, four matching cards
2 : wait what
1 : but you'll have to, you'll have to use one of your actions
3 : well oh well, i've gotta be on the tile, i've gotta be on the tile. yeah, there we go
1 : ok
3 : that makes sense
1 : that's fine
1 : oh
3 : oh i'm on it already oh well, i've gotta wait for my that's an action
3 : i guess
3 : ah
2 : if you discard four matching treasure cards while on the corresponding tile ok so you have to be
3 : yeah ok discard, i have to discard em, yeah
1 : so you have four and you're on it. you just have to use an action on it
3 : ye
3 : use an action on it, ok
1 : yeah ok
3 : ok
1 : second action,
1 : third
1 : i have four
3 : nice
1 : discard one of these
3 : shut em up
1 : uh tidal palace, sorry
3 : what's the other one?
1 : this one
2 : tidal palace
1 : k
3 :  i'm ok
1 : alright
1 : your turn.
2 : you done with yours? no i don't wanna give
2 : do you have you gave him one right?
3 : yeah, yeah, i got the four. yeah
2 : so we don't need to do that
3 : not on that, yeah
2 : ok
2 : and then you just have to wait till i you land, till it's your turn again.
3 : till it's my turn, yeah.
2 : mm
2 : see
2 : ok
2 : the treasure card  anyone on the island for one action card
1 : you should just shore some of these up around here
1 : see
3 : yeah
2 : yeah i mean that's what else can i do?
1 : yeah i would shore up whispering garden
1 : as one of them
3 : definitely.
2 : ok
1 : do you have one more action?
2 : yeah, i have one more
1 :  one of the other two 
3 : is she diagonal? does she have the diagonal one?
2 : oh can you do
3 : this'll be have that as a skill or something
3 : yeah explorer
3 : she explorer?
3 : yeah no, messenger, never mind.
2 : messenger
2 : no, that's yeah i can't
3 : that's the explorer, yeah
2 : cause i would've moved him
2 : well i could still move another one right?
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you have one of these
3 : yeah
1 : too.
2 : so that's two
3 : that's three, just do another one i guess or you're oh
1 : or did you move and then flip two? is that what happened ok
2 : yeah i moved and flipped two, so that's it. so now i take what?
3 : yeah then it's that's your three moves then, yeah
2 : three flood cards?
1 : uh treasure cards
2 : treasure cards
2 : take up to two
1 : but you have to discard two of them based on what you get here
2 : ok
2 : and then three water cards, right?
3 : you have to dump one more.
2 : oh i still have too many
3 : i probably the blue one yeah
1 : dump that one since he's gonna have it.
2 : yeah because we don't need that one.
1 : yup
2 : i'm getting there
3 : yeah
2 : little slow.
2 : ok
3 : eh i'm the same way

3 : which guy are you?
1 : uh here
3 : here
3 : so
3 : oh
1 : i'm gonna be going here

3 :  flip that back
3 : i'll get over here.
3 : helicopter lift
3 : you there
1 : unless
1 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : then uh
1 : do you, do you still have one of the helicopter lifts?
1 : did you discard
3 : i discarded em
1 : them both, ok
3 : should i i should've kept em
2 : i would see you could capture it on your turn, right?
3 :  two
3 : and then
1 : what mm
1 : we might be in trouble, we're gonna need to
1 : helicopter lift out of here if we
1 : we'll, we'll get to that

3 : no i don't have one of those though.
2 : so i'll just get rid of the ok
2 : that'll work. here's them two and
1 : plus you're already on the golden
1 : icon.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : that'll be good.
2 : here it is.
3 : there it is right down the end.
1 : good
3 : yeah
2 : dunes of deception
2 : and misty marsh
2 : put that one over, here's the card, ok.
3 : over there, yeah.
3 : ok so
3 : discard the water's rise card
1 : on that one
2 : into the
3 : the, the that one, that one action
3 : right here.
2 : oh yeah, i, i can
3 : for treasure whatever's 
2 : yeah
3 : ok uh
3 : so now i'll fly
3 : i'll fly uh

3 : umm
3 : i guess that's about it.
3 : sandbags
3 : the reds
3 : sandbags
3 : sandbag uh i guess uh
3 : that
3 : or
3 : we're gonna have the  little bit.
3 : this one.
3 : or
3 : doesn't really make a difference i guess
3 : or you know what, that, that, that make that one more connected, yeah
3 : hmm, ok
3 : and
3 : two
3 : three
3 : the whispering garden,
3 : howling gardens,
3 : is gone.
3 : and the cave of, of embers
1 : i just realized what we should've done, we should've had you
2 : why?
1 : fly me
1 : there so i could give her this card
3 : i don't have a helicopter
2 : oh yeah
1 : aren't you the
2 : pi
3 : i don't have
1 : the pilot?
3 : i don't i don't have the helico you have the helicopter lift

3 : for someone else. i can only fly myself
1 : gotcha
3 : anytime.
2 : oh
1 : umm ok
1 : then now let's do that
1 : retract that
1 : these as one action,
1 : cash that in,
1 : fly
