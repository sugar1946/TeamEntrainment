2 : mmhmm
4 : ok
3 : that's the messenger
1 : that's the messenger
2 : yes
3 : and this is the explorer.
3 : right
1 : ok, so starts with my turn
1 : umm
4 : we just start where we're placed there?
1 : yup
1 : looks like it.
4 : just randomly? ok
1 : i'm not sure it's random, but yeah we just start there. there's little icons on the tiles
4 : oh yeah
4 : oh
1 : that show you where they start.
4 : oh
1 : ah so i think
2 : you might as well start shoring up the ones that are next to you
1 : yeah
1 : that's what i was thinking. actually i can just shore up these two
1 : move here, and shore up these two, just to get us out of
1 : trouble
1 : when we need.
2 : and then save
2 : don't you have one more action?
1 : nope, that was three actions.
2 : oh, cause you moved one. got it.
1 : i moved
1 : so then i need
1 : two,
1 : two of those.
3 : is that your ability, as an engineer, to be able to shore up two?
1 : yeah
1 : i can shore up two uh and we got a water's rise.
4 : wh what was your third action then?
1 : umm
1 : so my first action was to shore up these two,
4 : yeah
1 : my second action was to move, my third action was to shore up these two.
4 : oh, ok, got it.
1 : umm, alright, so this goes
4 : good engineering
1 : up,
1 : this gets shuffled,
1 : and then two.
1 : alright, well looks like it was these two.
1 : so that was useful
2 : i'll take your treasure card
1 : hmm
1 : yup, thank you.
2 : mmhmm
1 : think that's everything, so that's my turn.
1 : yeah
1 : you're up
2 : ok, umm
2 : so i guess i will
2 : shore up whispering garden first.
1 : yeah
1 : umm what do we have for
1 : treasure cards out on the table, umm
3 : i have one
1 : yeah
3 : lion with wings
1 : i got two fires and a cup and you've got a cup so
1 : looks like we've got about two of each out.
4 : yup
1 : so i guess we have to wait and see what we get next.
2 : ok
2 : umm what else should i do?
1 : umm
1 : you could
1 : give one of us a card and then start moving somewhere.
2 : so should i maybe give this to you since you already have one?
1 : yeah, i've got one of them, if you give me that i'll have the second.
2 : then
1 : and then
3 : umm
3 : i think since i'm the closest
2 : mmhmm
3 : to that treasure
3 : umm
3 : that maybe i should get those cards,
3 : the card.
1 : well he can move diagonal so i don't know if we need to worry about that.
3 : oh yeah
1 : he can't get there in one turn, but there's the other one right here.
3 : oh, yeah yeah
1 : umm so
1 : you've got
1 : two action one action left.
2 : one more
1 : oh if you move
1 : yeah i was gonna say if you move to the marsh he can give you
1 : the other stone
1 : and then we can move from there.
2 : ok
1 : right, so then draw a treasure first.
2 : so
2 : you get another one, right?
1 : yeah
1 : ok that
1 : yeah, that makes sense.
1 : and then, two of these guys
2 : it's only if you see em
1 : so the gold gate's here, that goes away.
1 : that was quick
4 : and then put that guy in here
1 : no this one, gold gate
1 : yup,
4 : gold gate
2 : sorry
1 : and phantom rock
1 : is there, that also goes away.
2 : is also gone.
4 : what
1 : well nobody was near them, there wasn't anything we could've done about that.
4 : mmhmm
2 : ok
4 : and they didn't
4 : did they even have any treasures?
1 : and then pilot, i believe
1 : no, they didn't.
4 : they didn't, that's good too.
1 : yeah
1 : pilot, you're up.
3 : oh umm, so i can fly anywhere?
1 : you could, umm maybe get the lost lagoon flipped back over.
3 : that's what i was thinking.
3 : so
3 : i don't need to necessarily be on it
1 : nope, you do not.
3 : to,
3 : to shore it up
3 : just be adjacent to it
3 : so i'm gonna shore it up
1 : and then one more action, where do you wanna go?
3 : i can still move again
1 : you've got yeah, you've got one action
3 : or i can give a treasure card
1 : yeah, well you're not on a tile with anyone
3 : oh you have to be on a tile with someone to give a treasure card, ok.
1 : yeah
1 : unless you're her.
3 : uh
3 : so i will just move
2 : is there a lion by you?
1 : no, uh
3 : no
3 : uh, yeah there is.
1 : yeah, the lion, the lion's right where i am, on whispering garden.
2 : what if
1 : so you could move up to that
2 : you move on that with him and then give him the fourth one?
1 : uh that's three actions
2 : oh wait, you only have two.
2 : oh, you're right.
3 : oh alright well i'm just gonna move to whispering garden
1 : yeah, and i also don't have the lion, umm those two have the lion
2 : oh, my bad
3 : i draw two treasure cards
4 : mmhmm
1 : yup
1 : two of those
3 : helicopter lift and fire
1 : ok
3 : and flood cards right?
1 : yup
1 : you need two of these.
3 : thank you
1 : so we got the cl
3 : umm chiefs of abandon and breaker's bridge
1 : yeah, the cliffs are right here.
1 : and breaker's bridge is here.
3 : oh 
3 : 
1 : nope, that goes here.
1 : umm, explorer
4 : i'm good
4 : ok
1 : i think you should
4 : can i, can i shore up a di a card that's diagonal to me? ok.
1 : yes
1 : yeah
4 : so, what if i did
4 : what if i went
4 : shored that up,
1 : yup
4 : went here, and then gave her my earth stone?
1 : that makes sense.
4 : shoring it up,
4 : going there,
1 : and she's got
1 : plenty
2 : thank you
4 : yeah
4 : she's got only earth stones
1 : you think she's got three of them
4 : yeah that's a good look.
4 : so then take two treasure cards
1 : yup
4 : that's some good times there.
4 : and uh
1 : alright, it looks like we got four fires out also
4 : to my flood thing
1 : yeah
4 : still take two
1 : yup, we're still on two
4 : moon
4 : and iron gate
1 : iron gate is
4 : that's probably negligible but that's probably
4 : bad, i don't know.
1 : well we just, we can't lose both of em.
3 : does anyone else have a helicopter lift card?
2 : nnhmm
1 : nope, you've got both of em
3 : ok so
3 : i'm thinking maybe i can
1 : but we
3 : possibly move uh
3 : somehow get to like the same card that she's on and then lift her
1 : uh maybe
3 : or never mind it's right there, temple of the moon is right there, actually, yeah.
1 : it's right there and she's just one step away anyway, umm we need to
3 : yeah
1 : get her a fourth one first.
1 : that's the trickier part
1 : umm
4 : is to go to the
4 : to the space that has the thing on there, to get the treasure, right?
1 : yup
4 : once you have all four cards.
1 : i think
4 : but we don't want that to sink
1 : yeah
1 : just,
1 : oh we don't
1 : uh what makes sense?
1 : well i can, umm
1 : go ahead, shore up breaker's bridge
1 : move to misty marsh and shore up the temple.
4 : there you go
1 : that seems like it'd be useful, so
4 : mmhmm
1 : oops, sorry
4 : wait can you move diagonal?
1 : uh, no i can't
1 : you're right
1 : uh i
4 : maybe you should just move twice and then shore it up.
1 : i can't move twice but uh i can move twice but i can't shore it up if i move twice
1 : umm
4 : wait
1 : yeah i guess i'll go ahead and move.
4 : wait, wait, wait, why can't you shore it up if you move if you go like this?
1 : i only have three actions, i already used one.
3 : he shored up breaker's bridge.
4 : oh well i said if you, if you don't shore up breaker's bridge
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah, i can
4 : and then just move twice and then shore that up cause that's
4 : more important to get to, i'm just saying.
2 : the only thing,
1 : uh, i think it's gonna be ok
4 : alright, well yeah
1 : it just came out.
2 : yeah
4 : alright
1 : umm, no i guess yeah might as well do that though, just in case
1 : i'll do that
1 : and then umm, so that's my three actions.
4 : uh huh
1 : so we will
1 : we'll, we'll do your idea 
1 : and it's a good one too.
1 : i got another water's rises
2 : 
2 : good thing you did that then
1 : yeah
4 : uh we're at three.
1 : good idea, good idea.
1 : iron gate goes away
4 : buh bye, iron gate
4 : 
1 : alright
4 : ah man
1 : umm and i've got five and that goes, thank you
2 : mmhmm
2 : alright
2 : oh
2 : i might as well just flip these over.
1 : so you, we need another, you know we don't
1 : yeah
2 : both of these? k
1 : and then go ahead and move to the temple
1 : umm and we'll try and find a
1 : fourth one for you.
4 : soon
1 : hopefully
4 : or maybe  one
2 : i got it!
1 : got it
4 : yay
2 : so does that mean i can get the treasure now?
1 : nope, you have to wait and you have to discard a card so i would toss the sandbags
1 : you're at six right?
2 : one, two, three, four
4 : yeah
1 : so toss one of the sandbags
4 : in the discard pile.
2 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : or, oh, well i guess we could've used oh well
2 : can't i
2 : was that
1 : nope, there's nothing yeah, i you could
2 : what if
4 : would by wait, what do you mean, like
4 : isn't, isn't grabbing a treasure one of the three actions
4 : one of the four 
1 : ye
1 : yeah, it's one of the actions, i mean she has to wait until her next turn.
4 : oh
4 : oh
1 : she used three tu three actions already.
3 : oh
4 : oh she did, oh ok
1 : yeah
4 : oh, i see
2 : unless i turn this back over and then i can give this to someone.
1 : no, you'd have to use it
1 : umm
1 : that's a
1 : question.
2 : but i drew this after this was already turned back over
1 : right, right, right
2 : like my turn so
2 : maybe i can't go back.
4 : yeah i guess you can't
4 : you can't reverse your, your
4 : sure.
1 : i what i'm wondering is if you could just use it instead of discarding it.
1 : i think it's immediately you have to re you have to discard a card
3 : uh yeah i think you have to discard it as well.
1 : when you draw.
4 : well anyway
2 : wait, it can played at anytime, does not count as an action.
1 : yes, but i thi mm
4 : yeah
4 : uh, you can
1 : you must immediately choose and discard extra cards. you may use the power before you discard it, so yeah go ahead and flip breaker's bridge.
2 : awesome.
1 : ok, umm and draw three.
2 : ok, now
4 : flood
4 : yeah
2 : good thing we did that.
1 : alright
1 : breaker's bridge, whispering garden, and the lost lagoon, it's right here.
2 : where's whispering garden?
1 : right here, i'm on it.
2 : i think yeah
1 : you're not on
1 : i'm sorry, he's on it
1 : pilot
1 : umm i was going to suggest
1 : umm, i've got two of the fires.
1 : you've got one and you've got one.
1 : and you're on the tile with me right now, if you can get to the tile
3 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
3 : misty marsh
1 : yeah, umm, but maybe just go ahead and
1 : shore up the whispering gardens first.
3 : ok
3 : i'll shore it up.
1 : and then you can
1 : fly over
3 : to misty marsh
1 : yup
3 : cause i'm the pilot.
3 : and then
3 : i have one more action.
1 : and then give me the fire.
4 : give him the fire.
3 : oh
1 : oh wait, that means i have to get rid of something.
4 : that's ok
1 : yeah, it's just
2 : wait, why doesn't he like shore up this too, while he was over here?
1 : umm, ac he has only three actions.
3 : yeah
1 : actually yeah, don't give that to me yet.
2 : instead of the fire.
1 : umm
1 : i think
3 : i you know i think you're
3 : 
1 : i think, i mean i'd have to get rid of a card and we might as well get it traded
3 : yeah
3 : and give it  to him.
1 : or something first.
3 : yeah, ok
1 : umm
4 : yeah, i could use a, a lion
3 : so i still have one more action
1 : right
1 : cause i've got a lion and he's got a lion.
1 : actually, why don't you, you, you we can so we've got two options here.
1 : umm, either you could've moved here and then shored up these two tiles
3 : i don't think
3 : i can move back
1 : no i mean, we can your turn's not over.
1 : we can
3 : i have one turn and i can't fly again.
3 : i can only use this
1 : no i'm saying that we
1 : your turn's not over
1 : we can do different actions, it's just
2 : i think it'd make the most sense if you gave him the lion because
1 : yeah
1 : or you can give him the lion, that's easier
2 : the chance of getting another water's rise card right away is probably not
3 : uh huh
1 : hopefully
2 : likely, yes.
3 : so i will give you the lion 
4 : oh
4 : nice
3 : and my turn has ended.
1 : yeah, so draw your two treasure
3 : i have a cup
3 : or the chalice and
3 : the purple rock thingy.
1 : well we're good on the rocks so
3 : i can
3 : i don't have five yet, i mean i don't
1 : mm no, she's got four.
3 : don't have six.
2 : like
2 : that one's
2 : useless at this point.
3 : if you have you can have five cards, right?
3 : ok
1 : yeah, you
2 : yeah
4 : you can't have more than five, yeah.
3 : can't have more than five?
3 : alright
3 : i need
3 : two of those
2 : three of em
1 : three
4 : three now, yeah.
3 : three
3 : thank you
2 : mmhmm
3 : umm copper gate,
3 : crimson forest,
3 : and the howling garden.
1 : that's the one over there.
4 : oo
1 : it's ok
4 : but we get back to that lion.
1 : you're we're closer to this one.
4 : wait
1 : nope, those go over here.
3 : oh
3 : those are for sunken
1 : yeah
3 : right, ok
1 : these can come up again
2 : alright
3 : how would they come up again?
2 : next
1 : uh if we had a water rises card
3 : ok
1 : they get shuffled and put on top.
1 : umm, i think that's a you're, so you're up explorer.
4 : yeah, ok
1 : so i think
4 : so i can do some shoring
1 : yeah
4 : umm
4 : i think i'm gonna wanna shore
4 : this guy,
4 : yeah?
1 : yeah
4 : uh
4 : i think i'm gonna want to
4 : umm
4 : let's see.
4 : do i wanna give you a
1 : no, don't give it to me
4 : no, not yet, cause that'll drop one of your guys off.
1 : umm
1 : yeah
4 : but wait
4 : you could, you could drop a chalice off no problem, right?
1 : no, we
4 : because you can give me well a, a lion next turn
4 : i can just move to the lion
1 : right, but it so
4 : and secure
1 : i think it's gonne be better if you don't trade me the fire yet
4 : no?
1 : yeah, umm
4 : i don't know it's like a bird in hand next turn man
1 : right, but i can do it i'm the next person to go and i can just give it to you.
4 : right
1 : umm, if you
2 : but you have to be on the same card
4 : no, no, no, what i meant is
1 : yeah, i know
2 : like he's thinking ahead
4 : what i meant is
4 : uh, i'm thinking ahead that you give me the lion next turn
4 : and i give you the fire now, you drop a cup
1 : ok, i guess we could do that
4 : no?
4 : is that cool?
2 : i think
4 : and then
1 : yeah
2 : that makes sense because
4 : i jus
4 : ok
2 : we're gonna our three treasures, i have this one already, then it makes sense to get the lion and the fire so that
4 : right
4 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok, that works
4 : ok, so i shored, that's one
1 : yup
4 : two, i'm moving to umm whispering garden
1 : nope
4 : no?
4 : 
1 : you're gonna give me the fire first
4 : oh, ok, whatever
4 : sorry
1 : uh, cause you can't do it  before you move.
1 : or you can't do it after you move. now you can go to the whispering garden.
4 : oh
4 : like oh i can only give you a card as my last action?
1 : no, you can only give me a card while we're on the same tile, then as soon as you leave
3 : yeah
4 : ah, oh right, oh god, i totally forgot about that, ok so great, of course, oh right.
1 : and then now you can move to
4 : technically, right, ok
1 : whispering garden
4 : uh and i'm gonna go there, ok
4 : and uh two treasures please
1 : uh i guess we
1 : oh well.
4 : what?
4 : oh
4 : oh, look at that.
4 : umm
1 : cause now i'm not on
4 : yeah
1 : yeah, that's fine.
4 : umm, water's rise
1 : oh again!
4 : t tick it up.
1 : alright
4 : tick it up, oh boy.
1 : do you wanna shuffle em, or do you want me to?
4 : yeah
1 : i mean you draw three, so, it's gonna be three off of that
1 : anyway.
4 : lagoon,
4 : howling, and copper gate. well that's good, that didn't
4 : ok.
1 : so the copper gate, and the lost lagoon, and the howling gardens are both gone.
4 : oh boy
4 : well
4 : see, luckily
1 : yeah
4 : alright
4 : that was good times.
1 : going quick
4 : whoa
4 : 
1 : alright
1 : so i'm pretty sure
1 : that my turn is just gonna be moving to whispering garden and giving you the card.
1 : i don't see any
1 : reason not to do that.
2 : mmhmm
4 : mm
4 : no, that's yeah well i mean
1 : right
4 : you can do one other thing. you wanna shore something?
1 : nope
1 : i can't do one other thing, cause i can't move diagonally.
1 : one, two, three. three actions
4 : oh, right, ok.
4 : there you go, that makes sense.
4 : there we are
1 : alright
1 : umm, alright, i got a pilot and another one of these guys.
1 : alright, and
4 : you gotta discard something.
1 : no i don't
1 : oh yes i do,
4 : yeah
1 : you're right.
1 : oh, we can get rid of this.
2 : lion
4 : yeah, exactly
1 : and then
1 : see temple of the moon,
2 : can i still
1 : yeah, you're still, you're still good.
2 : trade on it with the ok.
2 : awesome.
1 : the whispering gardens
1 : and yes, you can still trade on it.
4 : right, right, right
1 : and the cliffs of abandon, yikes.
4 : yikes
1 : umm
1 : so i would suggest, i mean you might as well go ahead and shore it up while you're here.
1 : turn in to get the
2 : mmhmm
1 : the chalice.
2 : oh
2 : do i
2 : put them here?
2 : and then just take that?
1 : i think they go there.
2 : or do i like
4 : yeah
2 : like this maybe?
1 : see it here
3 : this says you discard
1 : discard the cards to the treasure discard pile and move the figurine in front of you.
2 : that perfect.
4 : take that.
2 : thank you.
1 : and then this, or yeah, that one
4 : k that's one action
4 : or
2 : and then
2 : i think
1 : yeah, and then shore up maybe the temple and the crimson forest, just to give us
2 : well, both of these are kind of useless and we really wanna
1 : or
2 : have this one because the other lion was already
1 : yeah, but you can't get there.
2 : oh, you're right.
4 :  not, i can i mean
4 : one of us can shore that.
1 : you'll have another turn first
2 : wait, i have a sandbag.
2 : can't i use it on that?
1 : yeah
4 : ok
3 : does it need to be flood does it need to be umm
1 : no
3 : shored before you can claim the treasure?
1 : no it doesn't, but that just means that, just in case
1 : the, if it, we don't want it to sink before we get the turn.
3 : oh ok
4 : was that three actions?
1 : cause then we lose. ah that was two.
2 : that was two,
4 : two, ok
2 : so
1 : no, it was just one.
4 : no she moved
1 : the sandbag
2 : i traded in my
1 : she didn't move.
4 : oh, she didn't move.
2 : things
1 : sand, sandbags doesn't count as an option as an action.
2 : oh, ok
4 : oh, ok, so you still have two actions,
1 : yes
2 : so
4 : cause all you did was trade so far,
4 : or capture, as it were.
2 : umm
1 : so
2 : which two things
1 : umm, maybe move and shore up the cliffs to make sure that we've got a path to walk on.
2 : that's a good idea.
4 : cause we you're gonna need to get to that chalice.
1 : well, we'll also need to get to the landing afterwards.
4 : palace
4 : of course
2 : ok
4 : yeah, chalice
2 : maybe we can go for this.
4 : mmhmm
4 : embers
2 : crimson's gone.
4 : crimson
4 : yeah
1 : and so is breaker's bridge.
4 : ok
1 : ok
1 : well this is going quick.
1 : umm
3 : it's my turn.
1 : yup
3 : umm
1 : so why don't you give her a
1 : chalice?
1 : give the messenger a chalice, umm and
1 : what can we do with
3 : i shouldn't give you this fire just yet?
2 : you're not on the same
1 : well you need to be on the tile.
3 : yeah, i was thinking of moving, oh so, i only have
1 : yeah
3 : two moves left.
1 : umm
1 : you could give it to me then we'd have
1 : the tokens for fire
4 : you'd just have to get
3 : i would have to fly
4 : to yeah to the one of the caves.
1 : yeah, but we have a couple extra helicopter lifts if we need to.
3 : yeah
1 : so, yeah, i don't see why not.
4 : move to his, his uh, move to the whispering garden, give him a fire
1 : yeah
3 : move using my helicopter oh wait, i'm a pilot, i'm a pilot, i'm a pilot
1 : no, move you're a pilot.
4 : 
3 : ok
1 : yeah and if you give me the fire then i'm tossing this.
1 : umm, which is unfortunate but
3 : we'll get it back.
1 : yeah
