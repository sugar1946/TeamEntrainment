1 : ok so i'm going to start with an action, i like the way they
1 : h-had that in the practice, so i think i'm gonna move
1 : actually i'm gonna flip these two first, and then i'm gonna
1 : move up and flip those two and that'll be three turns.
2 : sounds great.
1 : i think.
2 : good job engineer.
1 : thanks
3 : wow
1 : alright and then now i pick up
1 : two of these
1 : nope two of those
3 : two
2 : mmhmm
3 : two treasure cards
1 : ok
1 : and we have the water rising so i have to
1 : do that real quick
1 : and so i move up one tick
1 : shuffle the discard
2 : mmhmm
1 : yup
1 : k
1 : put it back on top
1 : and
1 : this goes in there
1 : oh uh over there thank you.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : alright
1 : umm and then
1 : now i have to draw flood cards
3 : you've got to yeah.
1 : that's the last.
2 : great
1 : yeah so i draw two
1 : we have phantom rock, if you guys want to help me out
1 : oh ok so that's gone
3 : oh that
3 : that's gone then.
2 : what?
1 : as well as this card and then breaking, breaker's bridge.
3 : ok
1 : is there and then there's that
1 : alright.
2 : alright.
2 : so
3 : there was nothing on phantom rock
2 : do up to three actions
2 : and gray
2 : so we have that, we have that over there.
2 : one action is move to whispering winds
1 : ok
2 : i'm gonna shore up breaker's bridge
3 : nice.
1 : alright
2 : and i will
2 : move to
1 : here
2 : cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
2 : take my two actions
2 : and
1 : might as well
2 : take my flood cards
1 : ok
2 : not sure if we need to keep saying it out loud but
1 : no that's fine
2 : golden gate is gone
3 : sometimes that helps
2 : and lost lagoon
3 : ok
1 : flipped
2 : flip
1 : alright
3 : ok my turn
2 : pilot
3 : so i should probably use my special power don't you think to go
3 : all the way over to lost lagoon cause it's the only one that's shored
3 : uh that's flippped over
1 : yup that makes sense.
2 : or you could be adjacent to it and still shore it
2 : as well.
3 : right but i'm not
3 : thats makes sense right?
2 : mmhmm. and then you're gonna
3 : ok
1 : yup
3 : yeah and flip it.
2 : ok
1 : and that was using your special power not the helicopter
3 : correct my special power
1 : copter lift, ok
1 : so that was two turns?
2 : great so you have one more action if you choose to.
1 : two actions
3 : so does it make sense to move back over so i'm closer to another
3 : pawn?
3 : that way we could get together if we needed to use.
2 : sure but then the first action
3 : 
1 : sure
1 : do we have any cards that
1 : it's not really worth sharing too much right now
2 : right
3 : mm no
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : your pick. i would stay somewhere in the middle.
3 : ok
3 : so maybe move over one
1 : yeah
1 : sure over there
3 : ok
2 : so you could have used your special power flown there, but we're learning still
3 : yeah ok now i need to pick
2 : alright
1 : alright
2 : two treasure cards
3 : oh i got the helicopter lift
2 : k
3 : that and two
2 : there's your floods
3 : ok we gotta flood cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
2 : oh i'm on it
3 : which is there
3 : and whispering garden
2 : whispering garden
1 : ok
2 : good pull
3 : ok
1 : alright and then, then you need two of these
2 : i think the engineer
2 : shoot yeah shh
3 : that's what i just did
1 : oh oh ok you already did that
1 : alright
2 : so i think your first move to shore those up
3 : guess i'm good.
1 : yup
1 : yup that makes sense umm
1 : although
1 : ah
1 : quesiton
1 : can i
1 : do these two at the same time?
2 : yes cause that's your move, that's your special
1 : ok
1 : ok
1 : i wasn't sure if the
3 : sweet
1 : adjacent
1 : and the one you're on
1 : counts as one or two. but i th
1 : i'm pretty sure that's one.
2 : yup, shore up any two for one action.
3 : ok
1 : ok
1 : umm so that's my first
1 : umm
1 : let's see do you think you want this?
2 : ch, ch, cho
1 : dude would that be useful to you?
2 : umm, i think let's go around one more time to see if anyone's
1 : ok
1 : alright
1 : so that'll be my end of that, of my turn
3 : ok
1 : umm so now i'll pick up
2 : so no movement? ok.
1 : pick two of those. got a fire.
1 : alright and that's my top five.
1 : umm and now i have to pick up two of these
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon
3 : iron gate
2 : temple
1 : ok
1 : and those are discarded.
2 : and it's my turn. ok, three actions.
2 : i'm gonna go
2 : to misty marsh
2 : shore up temple of the moon
1 : alright
2 : and
1 : so that's two
2 : move to temple of the moon
1 : ok
2 : and hopes
1 : yup
3 : yeah lemme pull it
1 : good plan
2 : raise the water, oh you go it?
1 : alright
1 : yeah i got it
2 : ok shuffle these
2 : put them on top, discard this
2 : and now i take my flood cards cause i took my action cards, one, two, three
1 : yeah
1 : three now?
3 : yup
2 : and we have temple of the moon
1 : ok
2 : whispering gardens
1 : ok
2 : and breaker's bridge
3 : breaker's bridge
3 : was that already out?
2 : looks like
2 : a bridge
3 : well, where is it?
2 : breaker's bridge, right there
1 : oh
3 : ah
1 : right in front of us ok.
1 : alright?
1 : is that it?
2 : yup
2 : pilot
3 : ok so i am over there
2 : mmhmm.
1 : ooo
1 : if
1 : i need four
1 : and you have one.
3 : so i should
1 : umm
3 : give that to you?
2 : you have to be on the same tile in order to do that though.
1 : may
1 : yes and then at some point i would need to get to a fire which i think is one, two, three, or one, two, three.
2 : either here
3 : yeah
1 : umm there's gotta be a full move for me.
1 : so if you move
1 : to whispering garden
3 : ok
1 : and then
1 : i don't know are we trying to salvage these two? probably two?
2 : yeah my thought though is if she passes you the card
1 : then my m
2 : you could lose the goblet on your turn, sure-shore those up and we could get you the lift at any time and get you to that real fast.
1 : ok but that would have to be used by you.
3 : ok
2 : right cause you, you got two.
3 : ok
1 : ok so we'll do that on the next round so
2 : or shh
2 : so you need to
1 : so should move
2 : actually
1 : unless you have
2 : if she shore's it up
1 : a better idea.
1 : yeah shore up that one
2 : then
2 : and then go here and it won't affect you because you could do two anyways, but
2 : yeah you'll have to get to that
2 : ah his square in order to give him the card though. you have to be on the same square.
1 : ok
3 : ok so shore that up
1 : ok
2 : mmhmm
3 : correct
1 : and you want to move
3 : yup
1 : so that's your turn, action two and then
2 : that's the uh fire card.
1 : pass the, the fire?
3 : sure. there you go
1 : and then this goes to discard
1 : over there
2 : treasure yeah
3 : yup
1 : ok and that's three turns
2 : correct
3 : yup
3 : so then two cards?
2 : two actions
3 : let's see
3 : ok
1 : alright
3 : so get
3 : one of these which i'll eventually get to use those sandbags
1 : yup
3 : i can use that now or should i save it?
1 : umm
1 : well i-it's gonna take me
1 : three moves to move over there right? cause it's one, two, three?
3 : ok
1 : so
1 : might as well
1 : use a sandbag unless you
1 : i mean the
3 : well do i want to save that because he's gonna get those things so it doesn't go
2 : r r
3 : down?
1 : i would save
2 : i
1 : i would save the
2 : i would save
2 : the ones with the treasure. this is worthless.
1 : hmm
1 : o
3 : right that doesn't matter.
1 : o-or the yeah or the one in the middle
1 : umm because if the one on the outside is lost, you can always swim to shore.
1 : umm but if the one in the middle is lost then you have to go around and it's a pain
2 : you have to go around. right.
3 : true
1 : umm so if you're gonna use it to save one, i would save this one.
2 : whispering winds. right. cause if
1 : uh unless well actually
3 : alright
2 : if you think one of these three is a whispering winds.
1 : ah unless you want me to use my first turn on the next one to save this and move two and get
2 : it could be lost
1 : closeish
2 : well remember these aren't actions so she could fly you there immediately after you.
1 : oh right.
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : forget it save
1 : this, save this one
2 : mm
2 : unless if you think
3 : well that's what i was thinking because you have these cards
2 : unless if one of these three is a whispering winds, then we've lost that
1 : oh
1 : true
1 : yeah mine's old, you want to use it?
2 : go ahead
2 : sandbag it.
2 : did you already use your three actions?
3 : well no you can use this any time.
1 : but it doesn't count.
2 : right, right.
1 : yeah
3 : so i'm just saying cause you have two of these
2 : right
3 : that we probably want to save that.
1 : right
3 : ok so yes
1 : sure, that's fine.
3 : ok
3 : ok and this goes which discard pile.
1 : treasure yep.
3 : ok
1 : now you'd
3 : next my three
1 : alright, luck, luck, luck.
3 : let's see
3 : lost lagoon
1 : ok
3 : cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
2 : cliffs
3 : and iron gate
2 : iron gate's gone
2 : and the garden also
1 : ok
2 : cliffs of abandon
1 : alright cliffs abandon
1 : what does it look like?
2 : yeah these's a picture
3 : here you go
2 : there it is
1 : ok thank you. here, i got it.
2 : alright
2 : alright
3 : ok
1 : alright good call and i'm glad we lost that card cause it was useless i think, right
3 : ok
3 : yeah
2 : right
2 : so
2 : i like the peripheal idea
1 : umm
2 : ok so you're first action should be to shore those two up. in the middle
1 : yup
2 : we could play this any time.
2 : so now fly him.
1 : but does it have to be
1 : played on your turn?
3 : played any time does not count as an action.
2 : nope
2 : anytime
2 : so let's fly him to
1 : ok cool.
3 : yep.
2 : a fire one.
3 : you wanna go here or there or where do you wanna go?
1 : ok
1 : whatever
2 : yeah
1 : that works
3 : does that make sense for me to move at all or stay where i am?
2 : cause that
1 : ok
2 : ah cause you're allowed to go with him.
1 : oh do, did you want to fly with me?
3 : yeah
3 : i don't know do we see a point in it?
2 : i think it's better to spread out because if we start getting flips we could start shoring up so that'll cost that
1 : right
3 : ok so i need to get rid of that.
3 : ok
1 : ok and
2 : so now your second action will be
2 : taking the treasure
1 : will be to
1 : take the treasure so i assume i just
1 : go like that
2 : now we
2 : discard these?
1 : these are discarded.
2 : err
2 : which
2 : can't ask them?
2 : this pile?
1 : i think it's
3 : should we look at the rules? i mean.
1 : yeah yeah, they they probably go in there cause they have to go into the pile.
2 : ok
2 : ok they're in there.
3 : 
1 : ok and
2 : and you have one more action
1 : my
1 : i think that's, that's all i should do right?
1 : good enough
2 : do you not want to start moving towards this maybe to shore it up or towards the center like your original strategy?
1 : oh sure yeah. umm i'll move one, that's fine
3 : yeah that makes sense.
1 : umm thank you, two.
2 : here you go.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : alright
2 : and three floods.
1 : oh
1 : and three of those, ok.
1 : so i might want to get this to you and so maybe we should
2 : oh
3 : yeah
1 : convene somewhere in the middle there.
3 : ok.
1 : unless these are flooded, umm.
1 : so howling garden, if you wanna help me out there. crimson forest
3 : howling garden
2 : howling gar
2 : right here, crimson forest.
1 : and copper gate.
2 : copper gate.
3 : ok
1 : ok and those go in there.
2 : excellent.
3 : ok
1 : alright, done.
2 : alright
1 : you're up
2 : so
2 : don't have these cards right now, so i'm going to move to crimson forest and just shore these two up.
1 : ok
2 : for my three turns.
2 : or three actions.
1 : ok
3 : ok
3 : makes sense
2 : got my two action cards
2 : that's the water one.
3 : oh no
1 : ok do you want me to, you want me to raise you one?
2 : shuffle these.
2 : oh i already did yeah.
1 : oh ok cool.
1 : ok put those back on and that card goes in.
2 : on the top this goes in there, take three still.
3 : mm
2 : i got whispering gardens.
2 : breaker's bridge and cliffs of abandon.
1 : i was here? no you were here. ok.
1 : and the cliffs
2 : cli
2 : cliffs of abandon
3 : cliffs of abandon
1 : got it
2 : nice looks like you got a lot of shoring up to do.
3 : mm k.
1 : ok
1 : yup, yeah no that'll be fine.
2 : alright and i'm done with my turn.
3 : ok so
3 : where should i
1 : i would
3 : anywhere should
3 : go?
3 : i mean
1 : ay i think we're trying to convene up here now.
3 : cause i could
3 : ok
1 : umm
1 : so may
3 : so to start shoring up
1 : i i would
1 : yeah cause on my next turn i could move up and i could shore these three
2 : you could shore
2 : yeah you could move one and then shore two,  oh right you could move two actions.
1 : yeah
1 : umm so maybe if you shore up
1 : this one and then start moving?
2 : wait wait, with three turns though you could shore those two, move one and then shore those two. so three turns you could shore all four of those up.
1 : oh that's fair. ok might as well move. move.
2 : which means don't use any of them to shore up unless if you think it's in the pull.
3 : ok that makes sense.
2 : but you don't know which of the four is in the pull
3 : i don't know which of them
2 : so yes
3 : and then we don't want to lose
1 : oh here
2 : well
3 : this one because this one has one of the
1 : w-w
1 : which
1 : well it
1 : it's
3 : things and so does this one and they're both
2 : oh
1 : it's, it's not likely to be these three. umm i know there's doubles in here but
3 : uh huh
2 : i got an idea, how about you come over to him
2 : and you take that card, i'll meet up with you and then two actions, you can give me those two, and i can run to the moon or i can give you my two.
2 : actually
2 : i could give any person
2 : yeah
2 : so i would say meet up with him
2 : i got an idea.
3 : ok wait, d i just, i just want to hear about it before i move anything.
2 : ok
2 : you're gonna move two.
3 : ok
2 : well on his turn or
2 : alright you know what
2 : move here
2 : and on his turn he'll shore these up, move here, he'll give you this
2 : and i'm allowed to give treasure to anyone anywhere for
2 : per action, so you're goal is to start moving
2 : towards either of the earth treasures
2 : cause you're actually gonna be getting it
3 : instead of you, instead of me giving it to you
2 : right great
1 : yes
1 : c-can you transfer as many cards as you want?
2 : ah one per action but yes anywhere. so that'll be two actions, so she could have all four of it.
1 : ok
2 : next turn so
1 : ok
2 : umm so right now
1 : and we're
2 : ah one, two would be my suggestion. he'll give you his card on the next turn
1 : ah, although
2 : and then he'll shore those up.
1 : umm one
1 : well i
1 : i have one move
1 : and then that's three
2 : oh right, right
1 : so do we want to save that or do we want to make
1 : make that transfer?
2 : well none of them are treasure ones so
3 : except for that one.
2 : i would do one transfer
2 : and shore these up
2 : right
2 : if we lose that
3 : cause we have two of them with the emblem that are both
2 : right but we only need three.
1 : w-w-we, we can also wait for the transfer for the next one cause we're both close enough.
3 : true
2 : correct
1 : i would say
1 : umm
1 : prioritize the
1 : saving
2 : ok then let's uh shore that up
1 : yeah so
3 : yeah that's what i'm thinking ok.
2 : yeah
2 : so that's one action
3 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : oop sorry that's upside down.
1 : no that's good.
2 : not a problem.
3 : ok
3 : then you want me to just get closer?
2 : umm, you might as well shore that up, that'll save you an action but ah yeah shore that up, that'll be two, move down here. he could move over, shore both these up, and transfer all in one move.
1 : umm
1 : inception
2 : so i'd say shore that up.
1 : does that work?
3 : yeah that's fine with me.
1 : ok
2 : good job pilot
1 : alright and that's three.
2 : yes, so here are your two action cards.
1 : ok
3 : ok
2 : or treasure sorry.
3 : oo yay! got another helicopter lift got another one of
1 : yup
1 : ok
2 : and here are your two, three, three flood cards
3 : those guys
3 : three, three now, unfortunately.
1 : ah
2 : howling garden
3 : ok temple of the moon
3 : howling garden
2 : temple of the moon. that's gone
1 : ok and put the howling garden card in there.
2 : mmhmm
2 : and lost lagoon
3 : yeah
2 : that's gone
1 : i don't see
1 : ok
3 : which that doesn't really matter.
1 : and that was ok.
2 : but
2 : this needs to be discarded totally and this gets put back there.
3 : right yeah i know.
1 : yeah
3 : see that's why i said we need to save one of them
2 : engineer's
1 : good call, good call.
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : well yeah that, that wasn't worth it at all. so or-or like yeah, so we're good. umm
2 : yeah
2 : so your turn engineer
1 : alright so i should
1 : ah move then shore up and then we can do a transfer.
2 : it's a worthless card though, i just realized there's nothing to it.
1 : well umm except for moving.
2 : ah
2 : ok
1 : so mi
1 : yeah
1 : umm so i gonna m
1 : move and then shore it up.
2 : shore up and transfer perfect.
1 : that's two
1 : and then
1 : umm
3 : is there a reason sorry, to interrupt,
3 : that
3 : you want me to do these purple ones, versus me give it to you?
2 : yes because i could transfer to anyone. i don't have to be on the same square.
3 : oh ok
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : umm the other thing is is your
3 : cool.
2 : so you're gonna start running there.
1 : why don't we
1 : i think we should get the lion first cause i can transfer this one now you can send that one to her and that's
3 : yeah
1 : that's one away
2 : ok
3 : that makes sense
2 : let's do it.
1 : ok so i
3 : ok
1 : i'll send this to you and that's my third action
3 : thank you
2 : that's your third move, here's your treasures
1 : ok
1 : alright, that, that was convenient i suppose umm
1 : and let's hope we
1 : actually i think we're ok
2 : crimson forest
1 : yeah crimson forest
1 : ah copper gate
2 : and cave of embers
1 : yeah
2 : copper gate
1 : it's here
2 : it's right there
2 :  only have five cards in your hand, right?
2 : these are special right? they don't count
1 : oh oh you have six, umm so why don't you
3 : oh
1 : drop
1 : do
1 : do we want to
1 : so, that that should have happened on your last turn so i think we're ok we didn't break anything else.
3 : ok
1 : umm which one do you want to drop?
1 : uh ah i mean obviously we should save the lions.
2 : right
3 : right
1 : do you want to save the purple things?
2 : i would get rid of the helicopter, it doesn't seem like we're using it a lot, yeah.
3 : yeah cause i have two of them.
1 : ok so get rid of one lift.
1 : and that'll be, ok. so that was going back a turn
3 : ok
2 : sorry about that
3 : ah huh
1 : now we up ahead?
2 : oh right these count ok umm.
1 : oh so you also
2 : right
2 : that's why she's pointing at that
1 : ah so get rid of fire cause we already have fire.
2 : oh
3 : yeah that's a worthless card
2 : yeah
2 : ok perfect
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : alright so we'll keep an eye on that in the future
2 : it says it doesn't count as an act oh
1 : these
1 : yeah ok
2 : not an action it's a card still
1 : ok so these are done we've flooded those
1 : and now it's your turn
2 : it's my turn and everybody's at five
1 : yup
3 : yup
2 : ok
2 : so i have three actions
1 : so
1 : i think
2 : so first thing is
1 : i, i would
2 : well that's going to knock another card out of her hand
1 : i, i would do
1 : ah save one and two. cause this has a card and this is central to moving.
2 : right
1 : and then send one
1 : to
2 : but that'll knock one of her cards out cause she can only have five
1 : true
1 : umm
1 : either way she has to get a lion
2 : right
2 : so it's probably beneficial to knock that card out, give her the lion
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : so i will save
2 : these, these two cards
1 : or these two? ok
2 : not the one i'm on.
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : you can swim
2 : and
2 : yeah
3 : thank you
1 : alright
1 : so knock out the purple
2 : and that goes to you
3 : ok
1 : i suppose yeah
3 : do we know how many of these purple cards are in total?
2 : yes there is eight
2 : they showed in the
3 : ok good
1 : ok
2 : yeah
3 : ok so discard other
2 : so
2 : that's discarded
1 : ok
3 : whoo ooh
1 : and
2 : and actually to get down to five cause you can use it any time, you can also just use the action.
3 : right
2 : so next time, so i'm at, i'll be at six now
1 : ok
2 : so sandbag, let's just save the ember cave rather than just
2 : just
2 : getting rid of it
1 : sure
2 : might as well use it
3 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
2 : and three floods
2 : i got the ah coral palace, the
1 : ok we'll help you out
2 : dunes, coral palace
1 : yup
2 : looks like
2 : and silver gate

2 : alrighty gang
3 : ok
1 : very good
2 : pilot
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : i can
2 : so you're gonna wanna
3 : go wherever
3 : so i wanna just g
2 : get to whispering winds and take the treasure
1 : actually
1 : ok
3 : or should i just use those one of my moves and like fly somewhere after?
1 : umm
1 : i i'm wondering if you might not want to save one
2 : oh yeah
1 : then move and then do that. this one's probably useless.
2 : good idea
3 : yeah
2 : so shore this one up
3 : cause that actually has a symbol on it plus that's on the outskirts, it doesn't matter
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : shore that up
1 : so so here's one
2 : move that
3 : ok
1 : two
1 : and then take the lion
2 : and take your lion
3 : whoo ooh! and then i discard these?
1 : and those cards go in there.
2 : yep
3 : yeah
2 : and here's your treasure
3 : which helps empty out my
2 : right
1 : ok
2 : here's your two actions.
3 : thanks
3 : ok
2 : and no matter what you do it's three floods
3 : ok let's see we'll
2 : so remember the worthless actions also.
3 : yeah i'm just gonna sort of separate that and knowing that that's already taken so it doesn't quite matter.
1 : yeah
1 : mmhmm.
2 : mmhmm.
2 : so the lion is worthless also, we still have these two card
1 : ok
3 : ok so we have the temple of the sun
1 : here can you put them down? ok.
2 : ah temple of the sun got.
1 : umm
3 : tidal palace, got it.
1 : and the bronze gate, ok.
2 : yeah we're good. we got all of them.
3 : ok
2 : engineer.
1 : and those go over here.
3 : ok one more to get.
1 : alright my turn?
1 : ok
1 : umm
2 : don't worry about these, these are worthless.
1 : yeah
2 : and even though if we lose that i'm sitting right next to the temple of the moon.
1 : ok so
2 : s
1 : umm
2 : so don't think shoring up's important.
1 : my priority
1 : actually, alright, where, where's the nearest cup.
3 : there's one here.
1 : ok so if, if i go, if i go
2 : if you hop over there
1 : here
2 : i can get it to you next turn right?
1 : right
1 : umm
1 : so
1 : but, but then i want to be in, end up the over there. umm, should i try and
1 : save these maybe if i move over, save and then move back one?
2 : one
1 : and then i'm with in a turn
2 : but they don't affect movement, they're not treasure cards.
3 : but is there a reason they don't affect anything?
1 : oh that's true. that's true.
2 : so
2 : i wouldn't, i wouldn't use that.
2 : uh
1 : ok so leave those umm so if anything i should just move.
1 : unless
1 : somebody wants
2 : b
1 : umm
1 : purple
1 : but i
2 : i guess i'm now the collector of purple now
1 : but i think we're ok
3 : yeah if you have enough turns i would give him the purple but if not i wouldn't
3 : prioritize that
1 : ok so
1 : it, it
2 : ah suggestion
1 : actually
1 : we only need
2 : one, two. shh might as well shore these two up cause you're still only one away. you'll have the fourth cup.
1 : yeah
2 : because i'll be giving that to you.
1 : ok i think that one's good. it's just blue.
1 : umm but
1 : oh oh right.
2 : ooo r one, two. the two adjacents. yeah.
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : the other thing is we only need three, we don't need four.
2 : right
3 : right we don't need all, so
1 : so i-if we're going for the cups, might as well move.
3 : just get
2 : don't even care about that and everyone start moving towards fool's landing.
1 : just m, just move and you can send it to me and we'll move towards fool's
2 : perfect.
