1 : ok
1 : so my first two ac or my first action will be to
1 : shore up these two adjacent tiles
1 : then
1 : umm
1 : i'm going to move
1 : one over
1 : and umm i can
1 : give any cards but i can shore up again.
2 : yeah
1 : and i'll shore up these two.
1 : ok, can i get two?
2 : mmhmm
1 : thanks.
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok, so umm i have a water's rise card.
1 : uh
1 : so two
2 : do you have to shuffle these first?
1 : oh yeah
4 : mm
1 : did not think we'd be starting with the discard pile.
2 : ok
1 : one
1 : two
1 : so phantom rock and breaker's bridge
4 : we just lost one.
3 : it's right here
3 : but it's already flooded
1 : oh, i flipped that one, that's the one we lose then.
4 : oh, ok
2 : ok
1 : ok, that's gone and that's gone.
1 : ok
1 : discard this and that goes in
1 : the other pile
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : well
2 : what, what do you guys think i should do?
4 : uh we don't
2 : there's not all that the
4 : really have enough cards to get any kind of treasure.
2 : 
2 : right
2 : so i can move
2 : here
4 : yeah
2 : and then shore up.
1 : mmhmm
4 : that's probably a
3 : ok
2 : that
4 : i think that's the best move honestly, until we have
2 : and then umm
4 : cards.
2 : should i, should i move somewhere else
1 : umm
2 : or just stay there?
1 : i don't know umm
1 : pilot, you're close enough that you could move
1 : and shore up the gold gate during your turn if you wanted to, so you wouldn't have to fly there.
3 : mmhmm
1 : umm, i don't think there's a reason for you to give me a card right now
1 : because i have two fire crystals.
2 : right
2 : umm
2 :  right, then i guess i'll just
4 : you could move and i give you this earth thing.
4 : the earth card thing.
4 : maybe. i don't know if we wanna try to do that or not.
2 : umm
2 : you i don't think you can give me a card.
4 : mm like if you had moved here and then on my turn i would move here and then give you a card.
2 : oh
2 : oh
1 : yeah
2 : i see
1 : or you could just fly to his space, you could do it.
4 : hmm
1 : well no, he, he'd have to give it to you, yeah.
2 : or i could give you this card.
4 : oh yeah, i guess that's true. alright.
2 : here, i'll just give you this card.
3 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : cool
2 : so then
2 : you get two of these
2 : and then i have to draw
1 : 
4 : mmhmm
2 : two
2 : no
4 :  on the same island tile but isn't she the messenger?
3 : oh
2 : i'm the messenger
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : oh ok
2 : ok
2 : alright, now i draw two flood cards right?
2 : or no
1 : did you draw two treasure cards?
2 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : yeah
2 : yeah, i drew two treasure cards.
1 : oh right, you gave him the ok
2 : and then i draw two cards right?
2 : because we're on two
1 : mmhmm
4 : yes
2 : ok
4 : 
4 : wait, do we have to shuffle the things back in right now or no?
1 : that's only if you get a flood
2 : no, only if you get that card.
4 : ok, ok.
2 : ok, so gold gate. oh well, he's gone.
1 : card
2 : and whispering garden which we are standing on.
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : what do you guys think i should do ?
1 : umm
3 : should i
3 : move close to yours and flip yours back over or
1 : i mean we're already here
4 : yeah but
1 : so oh right, cause we could yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : we don't
4 : yeah
4 : and that just got played
4 : and so if we get
4 : a uh
4 : flood tile thing in or flood card in the next two turns yeah
3 : yeah the rise thing
4 : plus i don't see like what other actions
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : i also can't use this
2 : if that were to sink because it's in the discard pile.
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
4 : oh ok
3 : so just go ahead and do that?
4 : i think so.
3 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : umm
3 : should i move to
3 : something that has a treasure on it or should
3 : cause this one doesn't, so
3 : wait
1 : umm
4 : but you can't
4 : shore up adjacent things anyway. or you can't shore up diagonal things.
3 : umm right here, should i move right here?
4 : no i don't
1 : umm, i don't think it matters which one of these
3 : ok
1 : you move to, just because we don't have enough to get a treasure right now.
3 : we don't have one of those anyways ok.
4 : yeah
1 : the only thing would be if you wanted to give us a card, you'd have to move to this one
1 : which
3 : ok
4 : well you only have three actions anyway so even
4 : if you walked here you couldn't
4 : give them cards.
2 : she can fly
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah
4 : oh that's right, that's right.
4 : yeah i don't think it matters.
3 : ok
3 : ok, i'll just umm
3 : move here then
3 : and then flip you guys over
2 : ok.
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : and then i'll have to use
3 : all three of my actions, so
2 : mmhmm
3 : i don't see why
3 : i would.
3 : and then i pick up two of these right?
2 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : ok
3 : thank you.
2 : mmhmm
3 : so, we're flooding lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon.
3 : mk.
3 : thank you
2 : mmhmm
4 : alright
4 : uh
4 : i can't flip both of these over
4 :  flip that one now and that's probably the
2 : well
2 : yeah ok, never mind, sorry
1 : yeah
4 : and then
4 : i kinda wanna stick around one of these, either this thing or this thing because
3 : mk
1 : mmhmm
2 : stay yeah. you should stay there because i can then give i can give you another one.
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
4 : right, right, right
4 : alright, i guess i'm done.
2 : ok
3 : ok
4 : thanks
2 : uhm
4 : umm thanks
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : you definitely wanna keep that up.
1 : so
1 : yeah i'll use my two actions to move
1 : to
4 : wait, wait, wait
1 : 
4 : hold on a second.
4 : let's just think about this for a second.
4 : uh
4 : cause it's won't be very hard. i'll only need one action to move this up right?
4 : but you're gonna need
3 : mmhmm
4 : all three of your actions to move it up
1 : mmhmm
4 : but i that's true, you're right. i don't know if it'll like go anytime soon.
1 : yeah
1 : or, or we could use
1 : the sandbag but i don't see a reason
4 : yeah
1 : why
3 : yeah, and there's always this one too.
2 : you
4 : that's true.
1 : yeah
3 : and i could like i have a helicopter though so i could fly one of you
3 : to that one if you guys
4 : oh, ok
1 : yeah
3 : whenever we need to do that.
4 : i do wanna give you this fire thing at some point though.
1 : ok
4 : i think that's important so we should
4 : somehow try to get our pawns closer together.
1 : mmhmm, so then it would be misty marsh would be a good place for me to be.
4 : yeah
1 : so it'd be one away from you.
4 : yeah, so i guess flipping this thing over is good and plus
4 : what i
4 : ok, i think it's a good move then. cause we have people close enough, we can probably flip that next turn anyway.
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : ok, so what're you gonna do?
1 : yeah
1 : so i'm going to move two
1 : and then for my third action
1 : shore this up.
2 : ok
2 : good.
1 : mmhmm
1 : ok, water's rise.
2 : no
2 : fun
1 : hooray
2 : fun
2 : ok
1 : ok
1 : the good news is even if we lose one of these two it's not
1 : a treasure.
1 : ok
1 : and then
1 : discard
1 : that
2 : ok
1 : and then
1 :  ok
2 : alright.
2 : so i'll my first move
4 : uh wait wait wait
4 : we need to draw the water cards now right?
4 : or do we not
2 : oh, you're right.
4 : yeah
2 : oh shit
1 : ok, so i draw another
2 : sorry
1 : three
2 : goodness.
1 : great
1 : breaker's bridge,
4 : alright
1 : temple of the moon, and whispering garden.
4 : we didn't lose anything.
1 : alright
4 : we did temple of the moon, this is breaker's bridge.
1 : and
2 : oh this  ok
2 : umm
2 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : first
2 : i'll give this to you
3 : explorer
4 : ok
4 : hold on.
2 : i'll, i'll give that to you.
4 : ok
4 : so that means i have to definitely discard a card?
2 : oh, do you not want it then?
4 : if that's ok.
3 : oh
4 : i don't know
4 : i don't know
3 : oh, i see. yeah, maybe you should hold onto that cause you only have
4 : mm
2 : you want me to hold onto it?
2 : alright
4 : well then let's just think about it for a second,
3 : because
4 : i really don't cause we have
3 : yeah a lot of those
4 : four lions right? which means we can get that card. we have four fires, which means we can get that card.
3 : mmhmm
4 : we only have three of this right now.
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah, just i would just keep it.
2 : ok
4 : so yeah, yeah, i guess that's a good idea. and we need to
4 : like we need to trade i think, yeah.
3 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : so
4 : uh
2 : would basically i should shore up something.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah, i think so.
2 : but
2 : what
2 : should that something be?
4 : uh
3 : well have you done an action yet?
3 : so you have
2 : i haven't done anything.
4 : no, she has three actions.
3 : ok, so
3 : can you shore up this one?
4 : do we wanna use a sandbag?
3 : already, no
3 : yeah, i forgot you had that.
2 : umm
4 : i was just thinking like, like she can definitely shore up
4 : these two, right. and then a third action would just be a movement
2 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
4 : but then i wouldn't
4 : shore up anything else and then the sandbag we don't have to use an action for. i'm just wondering if we should use it
4 : i kind of feel like, i don't know, why not. you know what i mean?
2 : well the thing is
2 : that i
2 : umm
2 : you can't use you can't you can shore up a tile before it sinks but it can't be used if the flood deck card for the sinking tile is already drawn. so this is already here, so i can't do that.
4 : i see.
4 : ok
3 : mm
2 : that's the one rule that i
2 : don't like
1 : well, no, i thought that was if you draw them both in the same turn
1 : you can't use it to save it if it's going to
1 : go.
4 : yeah cause then couldn't we never use the sandbag
1 : you can still you can use it right now, but if the next time we draw flood cards
1 : there's one for this one in that
1 : group, you can't use it then.
2 : ok, so if we break a rule
2 : does the game end?
4 : 
2 : i'm just asking, i don't know.
1 : umm, i thought so, no?
4 : if we break a rule, i don't know
2 : if we break a rule, does the game end?
3 : i think so
1 : ok
3 : no
3 : ok
1 : so i wasn't sure, i think
1 : i think we might have screwed up before
1 : i don't think you draw the flood cards again after you put them back on top of the deck.
1 : are we allowed to clarify that?
1 : mmhmm
3 : you can fly yourself
1 : ok
2 : so we did it right then?
1 : yeah
4 : ok
3 : sandbags can shore up any one tile
1 : ok, cause it went up to three and then ok
2 : ok so then can you use the sandbag card if, if the
4 : so
2 : water card is here?
2 : ok, so i know what my interpretation of that is but
4 : it's already drawn
1 : yeah
2 : what do you guys think?
1 : i mean based, based on what they were
2 : you disagree
4 : but wouldn't that mean we can never use the sandbag? the only way things sink is if they're drawn how
1 : right
3 : yeah
4 : isn't that kinda weird?
1 : i mean, based, based on what they said on the video, i'm pretty sure they just mean you can't use it the turn
1 : it's like you got a water's rise, you draw it, and then
2 : well if you, well if
2 : you could use it if
2 : the, these got say these got shuffled back in
2 : and this didn't get drawn again
3 : oh
4 : oh
2 : then i could use it.
4 : alright, i kinda see
2 : so
3 : umm
4 : i think that interpretation's correct.
2 : ok
2 : so i could umm
3 : this
3 : ok
4 : alright, so you can shore up two tiles pretty much, when you're on the one adjacent to you.
2 : right, so which one, which ones do you want me to so i'm gonna shore up this one?
2 : yes
4 : that's probably good, yeah.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah, since it has the treasure on it, yeah.
4 : cause we almost
4 : yeah
2 : ok, and which other one?
4 : uh
2 : i'd probably say the, the one in the
4 : breaker's bridge, yeah.
3 : yeah
2 : towards the middle? ok
4 : yeah cause a lot of ones on the side are like
4 : we don't really need them.
2 : mk so i have two of these
2 : then i have to draw three.
3 : ok, now we have four of those out.
4 : we have four  yeah
2 : ok, iron gate
2 : that's gone
2 : cliffs of abandon
2 : this one and lost lagoon
1 :  that's gone.
2 : ok
3 : ok, so
3 : i think that i should give this to you.
4 : yes
1 : ok
4 : but you guys have to be on the same thing
1 : yeah, you have to be on the same space as me to do that.
3 : mmhmm, oh i do, ok hold on
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : umm where are you at?
4 : you are blue
2 : you're blue.
1 : i'm here so you could
2 : so you can fly
3 : ok
4 : two
1 : yeah if you wanna fly to my spot.
4 : oh yeah that's yeah
3 : ok
1 : and then that way you could also
1 : if that's your one action and then you could
1 : no you could shore up one of those two
3 : and then i can give it to you.
2 : and then you can shore up i would shore up that one probably.
4 : oh nice
4 : it's good.
3 : yeah so i'll do this
3 : and then i'll flip this over
3 : and then i'll give this to you.
4 : awesome, ok and then
1 : ok now i have five
4 : so on your turn i'm gonna give you this flame thing anyway
4 : right and i guess we can sacrficie the chalice?
1 : yeah
4 : and that way you can
4 : get a card when it's your turn should be able to.
1 : mmhmm
1 : yeah and i have to give you the wind statue.
3 : wait you don't necessarily have to
1 : eventually.
4 : fuck, you're not close enough yet though.
3 : sacrifice it though, you can give it to one of us, cause i don't have
1 : yeah, that's true.
4 : oh, but look
4 : if i give him this card
4 : on my turn he has to sacrifice it cause he'll have six and he won't be able to like give it to anyone else, yup
3 : oh right
1 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
3 : mm
1 : but i'm not sure you wanna do that just yet cause i still have to be on one of these spaces to get it.
4 : that's true.
3 : yeah
3 : ok so umm
1 : unless you wanna airlift me to it.
3 : i have to pick up two more of these right?
4 : oh that'd be so good.
3 : and i so i pick up two of these
4 : i think that's such a good idea.
1 : uh huh
1 : well we'll see, she can use it on your turn.
4 : ok
2 : ok
3 : ok
1 : and you have
1 : aw you don't, never mind.
3 : ok so we're sinking howling garden, crimson forest, and copper gate
3 : copper gate
3 : uh
1 : uh huh
3 : ok
3 : thank you
2 : 
2 : alright so  you explorer
3 : mm
4 : ok
4 : alright
4 : so i do think we should probably get rid of the chalice right, we only need three out of the four things, we have four fire and four earth and four air
3 : ok
1 : mmhmm
4 : i don't think the chalice really matters
4 : at this point
4 : uh i'm probably gonna move here
4 : give you the fire card,
4 : sacrifice the chalice
4 : shore up i guess i'm gonna shore up the copper gate.
1 : ok
4 : wait
4 : ok
2 : not three right?
2 : three actions
4 : yes, that's three, so now we can do
4 : the uh
4 : flood.
1 : doesn't he have to draw treasure cards first?
4 : oh
1 : or did you do
4 : i don't think so.
3 : mm no he didn't draw yet.
4 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : thanks
4 : water's rise
3 : beautiful
4 : yeah
4 : that sucks.
3 : at least we didn't go up a level
1 : yup
1 : just prepare to lose one of these.
4 : alright
4 : copper gate,
4 : howling garden,
1 : this one
4 : ok
2 : dang it
1 : it's gone.
2 : 
4 : so that's lost, alright.
3 : ok
1 : and the bridge
3 : that's not too bad.
4 : yeah and breaker's bridge.
1 : yeah
1 : that's ok, we just can't lose this one, or else it's over.
3 : yeah no
4 : 
1 : right
4 : i really did not think we were gonna lose stuff so fast.
1 : ok so now it's my turn.
1 : so
1 : first things's
4 : ok so
2 : wait a minute
4 : do we wanna
4 : do the helicopter thing and send him to one of the fire places and then
4 : uh
4 : he can get the treasure?
4 : because the cop would only be one action right?
3 : yeah
2 : i was gonna say what if he shores up these two?
1 : yeah i need to do that first.
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : and then flies.
4 : ok
2 : and then umm
1 : mmhmm
2 : or
3 : umm how can he fly?
1 : well
1 : you have the hel
2 : you have the helicopter card.
1 : cause the thing is, is
3 : yeah but i have to wait for my turn right?
1 : i thought we could use it at anytime.
2 : no you can use them at anytime.
3 : i can use anytime? ok.
1 : and since that doesn't count as an action
2 : well i was also gonna say
1 : umm
2 : if you want to
1 : yeah
2 : you can shore up that one as well.
2 : alright.
2 : or no you can't shore diagonally, never mind.
1 : no
2 : alright
4 : are we sure it can be used at anytime?
1 : yeah.
3 : i'm not.
1 : uh, i thought
4 : ok
4 : i don't really think it says what does the card say?
1 : special action cards
2 : action
3 : oh it does say play at anytime.
4 : oh special action cards
4 : ok
4 : that's fine.
3 : we're good.
1 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : so
2 : ok
1 : ok yeah so i'm gonna shore up
1 : these two
1 : ok
1 : and then you're going to fly me to which one?
3 : mmhmm
1 : which one should i go to?
4 : which one's more likely maybe mm
1 : i was thinking this one cause it's closer to the bridge but
4 : because then you can shore up that?
4 : i like that idea.
1 : whould you do that anyway on your turn? ok
2 : yes, i would.
2 : because i don't really have much to do.
3 : it's also close to the
4 : but look
3 : this.
4 : i was gonna say this is like a nice little cluster of all the treasures, so if anything starts getting flooded
3 : two
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
4 : it'll be easy for you to shore things up when you're near there.
1 : that's a good point. that one is only near a, a chalice,
4 : yeah
1 : but this one also is.
2 : and we're not going for that.
3 : yeah
4 : and this is the only place we have the wind statue thing now
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : that's a good point.
1 : oh so that's only one of my actions
2 : 
2 : discard
3 : oh
2 : there we go.
1 : for my second i'll trade these in for a treasure
2 : ok
3 : cool.
4 : cool.
3 : yay
1 : umm
1 : and then i could, i could move.
1 : should i move
1 : just here so i'm ready to do that next time?
2 : umm
3 : i mean you can if you want
4 : maybe
3 : it's not like we
3 : need to be on this anymore.
2 : well here
2 : or
2 : or
2 : do
2 : mm see you have a lot of the
2 : cards.
3 : yeah, so
2 : he could give you
2 : this and you can discard your fire card.
1 : i can't, i'm not on the same space as him.
4 : you're on the same space.
2 : oh shoot, sorry, i keep like it's my power, i keep forgetting.
3 : right
1 : 
4 : it's alright
1 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : it might be better if you're
4 : here, just because
4 : if anything gets
4 : poten like potentially flooded or whatever, you have
1 : yeah
4 : yeah, you have the ability to flip over more things, shore up more things.
1 : yeah cause this
1 : right now, these this is  protect that and
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : yeah, that's good.
1 : ok, so i'll move here for my last one.
3 : that's good.
2 : ok
1 : ok, so two treasure first.
2 : ok, we only have fourteen minutes left.
1 : ok, i have a helicopter and a lion statue
2 : wow
4 : alright, well we got our first thing, we just need two more.
1 : i draw three
1 : ok, crimson forest, cliffs of abandon, whispering garden.
4 : right.
4 : oh we're gonna need to shore that up.
2 : uh it's my turn next i can do that.
4 : ok
4 : uh, cliffs of abandon is here
1 : yeah
1 : and crimson forest is gone.
4 : what else did you say? crimson forest
2 : ok go for it.
4 : crimson forest is gone.
1 : yup
2 : that one
4 : oh it is gone, ok
3 : 
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : i guess, i guess if we draw a flood card for something that's already gone we just take it out of the deck right?
1 : and discard it
1 : or would that not happen?
1 : i guess i'm
2 : wait, what was your question.
4 : it wouldn't happen. it shouldn't happen.
1 : cause the, the treausre deck is big enough that there are more than four, but there's not more
1 : than one
1 : flood card in here
1 : for each
1 : thing.
1 : ok
3 : ok
4 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : would it be beneficial
2 : for me to give anybody any cards?
2 : probably not.
4 : uh
1 : 
4 : well look
4 : i don't need this fire, right?
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm, yeah, especially since we already have that.
4 : if you give me an earth
4 : and then you give me an earth
3 : uh huh, yeah
4 : we should be good
3 : that sounds good.
4 : i think, ok
2 : ok
2 : so
4 : oh crap, i'm gonna lose one of these. well that's fine, he has a couple. cause i'm gonna i wanna see how if
3 : well
4 : if we do that i'll end up losing one of these lion things.
3 : yeah, that's, that's fine. cause i can give him one
4 : i still think it's ok, cause he has, yeah yeah yeah
1 : but we yeah we have more than four.
2 : ok, so that's, that's action number one.
3 : wait, wait, wait
4 : ok oh that's gonna go in the discard, ok.
3 : uh
3 : ok
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
3 : huh, interesting
2 : i'm going to shore up
4 : where ok
2 : this one
4 : one
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then i should just shore up another one.
2 : which one, this one?
4 : yeah, i would say so, yeah.
2 : this one?
1 : yeah, cause that one's a good connector.
2 : alright
2 : ok
4 : yeah
2 : so i will shore up this one.
1 : ok
4 : fantastic.
2 : ok
2 : two cards
2 : oh
2 : well look at that
1 : great
2 : umm ok so which one should i discard?
3 : oh that's nice.
1 : just  it
4 : that's interesting.
1 : umm
2 : this one, right?
4 : can we sandbag anything?
4 : no we can't
3 : well we don't
4 : we just
1 : we could do the bridge.
4 : breaker's bridge isn't in there, right?
4 : is it?
1 : oh right i
2 : yeah it is.
4 : oh ok
2 : so i should discard
2 : this because she's gonna give you that.
3 : yeah
4 : i think
4 : that is a good idea, yeah.
2 : right?
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : alright
2 : i'll discard that and then
2 :  us three of
2 : ok
2 : uh temple of the moon,
1 : mmhmm
3 : i need to give like each of you one of my cards.
2 : umm the cave of
2 : embers
2 : and silver gate
1 : ok
2 : which is this one.
4 : ok
1 : ok
4 : so we can sacrifice this thing now.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah we can
1 : yeah we can we don't care.
4 : like that doesn't matter anymore, yeah/
2 : umm
2 : right
1 : ok
4 : and potentially ok
3 : alright
1 : now just, just so you know, because you can use flying as one of you actions, and we both have a helicopter lift, if you wanted to
3 : mmhmm
3 : ok
1 : we could move you somewhere to give him the cards and then you could go somewhere else if you needed to
4 : 
2 : they're already on the same spot
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : oh, never mind.
2 : which is good.
4 : right
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : so
3 : ok
4 : so, i'm gonna discard this thing.
3 : and i give you this.
4 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : great
2 : ok
4 : thank you.
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : did that take one of my actions then?
4 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, that's one of your actions
1 : yeah
3 : and then
4 : so you have two.
3 : let's see
2 : i would
2 : shore up the temple of the moon.
4 : yeah
2 : just so he can get
1 : mmhmm
2 : on the next turn so he can get it.
3 : ok
4 : then well i guess you can shore up silver gate too
2 : mmhmm
4 : i don't see why not.
3 : right, but should i give this to him
3 : on this turn?
4 : i don't think you can. you have two actions and it takes two movements to get to him.
1 : i mean, she can she's the pilot. she could fly if she
3 : i mean i can
2 : 
4 : oh that's right, i keep forgetting that.
3 : yeah
2 : but that does take one of your
1 : yeah, i think it's better to protect this one
2 : actions.
4 : flying takes action.
2 : yes.
1 : yeah flying takes
4 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : i think that
1 : unless we used a helicopter lift card
2 : we need to save
1 : i'm not sure if you would want to.
4 : ok
4 : we could ok, we could sacrifice thing and then lift me over to the other side.
4 : i don't know if we wanna do that or not.
3 : ok, but we need to flip this over now.
4 : i don't know what's faster.
2 : yeah
4 : ok, that's fine.
3 : ok so
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : we'll flip that over, so that's the other action.
2 : ok
1 : mmhmm
3 : and then
3 : should i just move to
2 : wait, wait
3 : what?
2 : you can you fly
2 : someone else, or just yourself?
3 : i can fly someone else with this but
2 : oh but you can
4 : oh, like we could do it for free then she could trade with him and that'll be her last action?
4 : so what you thinking?
2 : umm 
3 : but i think it would just be
4 : i don't think it's a bad idea.
3 : better to move to him.
4 : you
2 : ok
2 : yeah, that's fine.
4 : ok
3 : ok
2 : umm
4 : but you
4 : you cannot move diagonal, like you're not gonna get over there in time.
1 : but she can fly there.
3 : i mean i can fly there.
4 : oh that's right, sorry
3 : ok
3 : so
1 : ok
2 : ok so you're done right?
3 : yeah
2 : is that three? ok
3 : so i pick up two of these
3 : ok
3 : thank you.
3 : let's see
3 : dunes of deception,
3 : coral palace, and bronze gate.
4 : ok
3 : cool
4 : one,
4 : it takes an action to get the treasure right?
1 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : two
4 : thanks. two
4 : uh
4 : i'm just gonna shore this thing up i guess
2 : umm
1 : he can do that diagonally.
2 : well
4 : yeah, i can.
4 : do we just want me to run back to
4 : fool's landing already?
4 : but whatever you what's the last thing we're getting.
4 : we could either get
4 : the wind or the chalice
2 : i also have yeah, i have these three.
1 : yeah
4 : right
1 : uh
3 : for your last one you can give
3 : them that.
2 : i'm not on the same tile. i keep forgetting that.
4 : yeah we're not on the same tile and we're not yeah we're not close enough.
3 : oh yeah that's
1 : yeah
3 : that's a thing.
2 : i keep forgetting that.
1 : i mean, again i could if you wanted me to fly you, i could do that.
2 : ok
4 : oh, ok
3 : oh yeah
2 : umm
4 : yeah but look, even if you flew me over
4 : and i gave you this thing, you still wouldn't have enough, yeah.
2 : you don't have four.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : so
1 : so there's no point.
3 : it would be more beneficial if like
3 : wait who has who else has the green i do, ok
1 : yeah
2 : so you should just
2 : shore up
4 : ok
4 : that's fine.
2 : the thing i guess
1 : ok
1 : so now it's my turn.
2 : alright
4 : alright, let's see.
2 : i you i know what you're gonna get.
4 : thanks.
4 : yeah
2 : it has to be
4 : i didn't get
2 : aw sweet
4 : yeah
2 : oh good, ok
4 : yeah
2 : aw crap
4 : thanks
3 : eight minutes
2 : ok
4 : yeah
4 : we got two
1 : ok
3 : yeah we're gonna get
2 : ok
1 : so
4 : damn
2 : so where you're right there right? so you can shore up
1 : yeah what makes the most sense?
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : ooo yeah
2 : two right?
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
1 : if i put
4 : so you could
1 : what would be best then is if i move to here
1 : to shore up the two with these treasures on them
4 : can you do this, like one move, two move, three move?
4 : or no
1 : umm
1 : so
3 : we need to flip this over, right?
1 : yeah
2 : right, so yeah, since he's on that so that would be flip that over, move here, and then flip those two over, right?
1 : which
4 :  just in case i think is a good idea
1 : oh
4 : right
4 : i think it's the most efficient thing to do.
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2 : ok
1 : ok
4 : you can
4 : you can
4 : do that though right? like it's not just tiles you're adjacent on?
1 : yeah, cause these aren't diagonal.
4 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : and then, so that's one.
4 : two
1 : two
4 : and then three
1 : three.
1 : ok
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : that one too.
2 : ok
1 : ok
1 : one
1 : oh no
4 : they got another helicopter though, so that's good.
1 : ah
1 : forgot.
2 : and nobody's on a sinking tile,
2 : which is awesome.
1 : yeah.
2 : the only person that would be safe
2 : would be you.
1 : one,
4 : me? oh yeah.
2 : yeah, cause you can go or if that's where you could move diagonally. nobody else could do that.
1 : two
4 : i can move diagonal, yup.
1 : three
1 : ok, temple of the sun,
1 : temple of the moon,
1 : and copper gate.
4 : ye ah
1 : ok, so we didn't lose anything.
4 : alright
3 : cool.
2 : alright
1 : hooray.
2 : alright so it's my turn.
1 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : i
4 : so we can't
4 : use the sandbags now, right?
4 : because there are cards in the deck, i think, so, yeah
2 : we can,
2 : we can, yes.
1 : yeah
2 : so
4 : and those are free actions and like
2 : true
4 : you have five cards.
2 : right
2 : so
4 : oh yeah
2 : these
2 : we don't really care about these because we already have the treasure.
4 : i don't think so.
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : right
2 : and so the only one i can't do is copper gate.
4 : ok so we could do
3 : which is fine.
1 : what
2 : so do you want me to do this one?
4 : yeah, i guess that's good.
4 : i just feel like
4 : you might end up with all four chalices, you know what i mean? if
2 : right
4 : maybe
4 : i don't know, they're just free actions, you know what i mean? i feel like we might as well use them.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : ok, so, so i'm gonna do that one.
4 : ok
1 : well, hold on, before you
1 : don't we also want the
4 : mm
1 : oh never mind, ok, sorry
4 : ok
2 : umm
4 : ok what do we wanna do now? do we wanna move you to the chalice thing just in case?
3 : i think we should
2 : ok
2 : so move, move
4 : ok
2 : i'm done.
4 : oh wait, wait, wait
4 : hmm
4 : that's two moves, right?
2 : we don't need, we don't need that.
1 : yeah, that's two moves, so you'd still have one
2 : we don't need that.
4 : we don't, but if we keep it in the pile it means
4 : it's less likely something else will get flooded. do you see what i'm saying?
4 : like if we keep this in this pile it means we won't pull something else,
4 : like fool's landing for example.
2 : so you, so you're saying i should use this, or i should shore up?
4 : no
4 : you could just shore it up and then one, two.
4 : right, and then that'll be three of your actions.
2 : oh
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : ok, so i'm gonna
2 : wait what am i doing i'm sorry, say that again.
4 : shore up for one and then move two
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok
4 : yeah
2 : 
4 : yeah
3 : ok cool
2 : ok
2 : alright so now i draw
3 : yay
1 : yup
2 : perfect
4 : alright
4 : that's what i'm talking about
2 :  we're gonna have to wait.
2 : umm
2 : oh sorry, thank you
1 : no it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
2 : ok
2 : alright well
2 : ok
2 : aw crap that's the one i'm standing on.
1 :  i see the copper gate in there.
1 : or uh the other gate
2 : no, bronze gate and dunes of deception.
4 : ok
3 : ok
4 : so
1 : yeah that was a good move shoring that one up, that would've been sunk.
4 : yeah
3 : so i can move right here
3 : and then flip this back over.
4 : well look, here's what i'm thinking.
2 : yeah
3 : or
4 : oh that's true, ok
3 : or i can and i can give
2 : or
2 : or
4 :  we can't sandbag it either.
2 : you should
2 : or i was gonna say, you can fly here
2 : and then flip this because we're all gonna have to end up on here
4 : right
3 : ok
2 : in order to leave.
1 : mmhmm
4 : but look
3 : oh right
4 : how
2 : and i since i'm here
2 : i
2 : i can get this on my next turn and we only have four minutes.
4 : right
3 : ok
4 : ok
3 : ok, so i'll do that and then
1 : yeah
4 : so wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
3 : can i give these two to him?
4 : that's what i was wondering about. i feel like she should fly here,
2 : oh
4 : give those two to him,
4 : it'll be his turn,
4 : uh i don't know in a couple turns
1 : mmhmm
4 : he can get that thing.
4 : we have
4 : three helicopter cards.
4 : even if this sinks
4 : we can still get you here pretty easy i think. ok
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : go
2 : go
3 : ok so
1 : ok great.
4 : alright
1 : so
3 : should i fly him to me? what do you, what do you mean by that?
4 : no you wanna fly to him cause he's on the
3 : where is he at?
4 : the wind tile. he's right here oh wait
3 : that's me
4 : you're right, ok, you wanna fly him to you.
3 : ok
4 : ok
1 : ok, so i'll use one of my helicopter lifts to fly me
2 : so you
4 : ok
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : take you
4 : so we still have two right we wanna definitely keep one at this point
3 : ok
3 : and then
2 : yeah, they both have one.
3 : i give them two.
1 : yeah
4 : ok
1 : so that's two of your actions and you can do a third if you
3 : so that's two of my actions and then i can fly here.
1 : yeah
3 : ok cool.
2 : cool
1 : perfect.
1 : ok
4 : alright
2 : ok
1 : two treasures
3 : oh right
4 : and then i guess
3 : sandbag and chalice
4 : i would probably just shore uh your spot up.
2 : hold on
2 : she has to
4 : ok
2 : get these but yeah you could do that when you go.
3 : cool
4 : oh yeah i'm just saying in the future.
3 : umm
3 : breaker's bridge
1 : ok
3 : uh
3 : cliffs of abandon and silver gate.
1 : ok
1 : awesome.
4 : ok
3 : i'm like surrounded by water.
4 : so yeah
3 : well you are
1 : yeah
4 : i think the plan, i think what i'm gonna do is one, two and then flip this over,
4 : that way we're all pretty close, even if
4 : oh, no, no, no
4 : even if
4 : like all this shit sinks right?
2 : you should do that
3 : wait, can't you go diagonal?
4 : i can move diagonal yeah.
3 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : it doesn't yeah
4 : yeah
4 : so that way you got this, even if the everything sinks around him, he can still helicopter out over to here.
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok, so one, two
4 : gonna shore this up
2 : ok
4 : that's three.
3 : ok
3 : cool.
1 : 
1 : yeah
3 : oh
1 : and just remember you can
2 : alright, we gotta go really fast
1 : ok
4 : ok
1 : oh
1 : these are treasures.
4 : turn's over.
4 : oh ok
1 : yeah these go in here and that goes there, ok.
2 : it's not
2 : no this, this is
4 : misty marsh
2 : is this
4 : cave of
2 : this is here.
4 : embers.
4 : oh ok, this is gone
1 : 
4 : whispering garden is flipped, but you can still get it so it's not
2 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : right
4 : and then this is flipped too.
2 : ok so
4 : you can go.
2 : you go
1 : ok
4 : yeah
2 : so take your give me your four
1 : so
2 : or you're not there yeah you are there.
1 : no i have to, i have to flip this first.
4 : no, no, no he is there.
1 : so i'm shoring this one up
4 : no you don't
2 : you don't have
4 : you can, you can leave it flooded.
1 : i thought
1 : yeah, ok, so then
2 : yeah, you can leave it flooded.
4 : yeah
1 : which two should i shore up next to me
4 : uh
1 : for an action?
2 : here just give me this first
4 : i would say just run, just go to the fool's landing.
2 : cause we have one minute and thirty second.
1 : yeah
1 : ok.
1 : so that
4 : ok so we're three
1 : i get this
4 : oh so we're good, we're done, we're with three, ok.
2 : well
1 : yeah, then i'll well we have to get there which is
2 : but we all have to get here, so wait, so wait.
4 : so wait
4 : one, two, three
2 : umm
3 : wait, i can fly you over there
4 : wait, wait, no, no, hold on everyone hold on
2 : we need one of those for the end.
1 : yeah
4 : he can move over there by himself right?
3 : oh he has one too
1 : yeah
4 : one, two, three, he's good.
1 : yeah
4 : it'll be your turn next
2 : he used, he used an action
1 : i yeah
2 : so he has two actions left
3 : yeah
3 : we both have a helicopter though
3 : so we can use
4 : but we have to keep one
3 : yeah, so
4 : ok
1 : right
3 : you guys are both diagonal
2 : and i can move here on my next turn
1 : as
1 : as long as we keep this protected with our sandbags and things, yeah
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : yeah, so we can use it
4 : that's fine
4 : alright we just gotta
3 : yeah, so you go ahead.
2 : ok so just go one, two?
4 : so fly over
1 : so i'll go
1 : here
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : well
3 : that's good.
3 : that's fine.
2 : that's fine, yeah, that's fine, ok.
1 : yeah that's fine, ok.
4 : that's fine, alright, throw your thing in there.
1 : so ditch this
1 : two
1 : water's rise
4 : ok
1 : great
2 : yeah, so shuffle
4 : is this up?
1 : alright
1 : one,

2 : ok, so you
4 : right here, misty marsh i already got it. here, here, here.
1 : alright
1 : ok
2 : have one to swim to, so you're right here.
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok
4 : ok, ok that's fine.
1 : and then are the cliffs still around?
4 : uh, we got em, right here.
1 : ok, great.
2 : ok are you done?
3 : 
2 : oh that's my move and then i would have to
1 : yup
2 : take two and just discard. no i'm just gonna discard them
1 : oh god
4 : i know that's terrible
2 : one, two, three, four
4 : it sucks
2 : oh, oh
1 : ok, copper gate's gone

4 : this is gone.
1 : and the brigde is gone, great.
4 : this is gone, this is gone. pass me those cards.
3 : ok
3 : ok, so i'm just gonna skip my turn and ooo
1 : ok
4 : we're done
3 : so close.
2 : we were so close.
3 : so close, yeah.
3 : that means we're gonna
4 : well played guys.
