2 : alright
2 : ready?
1 : ok, so
3 : what actions are you gonna take?
1 : umm, what can i do? shore up two tiles or
3 : instead of one, for one action.
2 : yeah
1 : yea
1 : yeah, sure, i'll do this one since that has the thing on it.
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : alright
1 : does it have to be adjacent?
2 : uh yeah
1 : i'm guessing
1 : ok
2 : or it could or you could be on it.
2 : so, you can get the lost lagoon now
1 : ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
3 : so you can do the lost yeah
1 : 
1 : and then umm
3 : then you can move
2 : move to the whispering garden
2 : and then you could shore up both the cliffs of abandon and breaker's bridge.
1 : oh yeah
3 : nice
3 : yeah
3 : yeah then
2 : alright
3 : two treasure cards
2 : 
1 : oh
1 : ok, so
2 : ouch, well that was fast, ok
3 : oh no
3 : ok so now
1 : move this
3 : yup
3 : move it one,
3 : and then we have to
1 : shuffle that or s-something
3 : draw two
3 : ok yeah
1 : and then put this in the treasure
1 : discard
2 : alright
2 : so uh
2 : draw two of these
3 : mmhmm
1 : oh ok
3 : uh so at the end of every turn you draw two.
1 : mm
1 : cliffs of abanon and phantom rock
2 : cliffs of abandon
3 : uh oh
2 : and
1 : oh
2 : oh
2 : well that was fast
3 : i need the phantom rock card.
3 : yup
3 : these ones both go out.
2 : alright
2 : so, my turn.
2 : umm
2 : i can give cards but i'm not sure if that's really that useful, umm.
3 : if you need to do that yet?
3 : so you can also move
2 : i think
2 : umm
3 : so if you move one you can
2 : take
3 : shore up
2 : shore
3 : yeah
2 : umm, do you want me to move over here first or
3 : oh yeah you might as well,
2 : alright so
3 : just in case.
2 : but then
2 : like
2 : shore that up and
3 : umm
1 : mm is there any way 
2 : umm, giving a treasure
3 : that's
2 : giving a card, like i don't think this
2 : uh is useful to give yet.
3 : no you
1 : i don't
3 : yeah
1 : it's not
3 : i mean you can just take one turn
2 : umm
3 : or two turns
3 : so you took two turns already
2 : yeah
3 : so we
3 : can just
3 : well two actions
2 : umm
2 : i can take a
3 : you can move again if you want
2 : umm
3 : one more time, or then you can just
2 : maybe i'll just take
2 : the
2 : treasures, the end.
2 : do that, because we can take
2 : up to three actions, so.
1 : yeah, that's fine.
2 : alright
2 : defer this turn, umm ok, so
2 : new treasures.
2 : sandbag and another earth thing.
2 : so
2 : better
3 : ok
2 : and two of these
2 : whispering garden and breaker's bridge.
2 : ok
2 : alright
3 : and then those, yup
3 : ok
3 : so now it's my turn.
3 : so i can fly anywhere
3 : should i do that?
1 : uh
2 : mm
2 : umm
3 : cause we
3 : we can't really give any cards yet
1 : yeah we
1 : we don't really have any.
3 : or anything.
3 : so i can just move
2 : umm, did you want to shore up any locations first or?
3 : yeah wait
3 : i mean i can move over here so i can shore up these two.
1 : probably like yeah, whispering garden, cause that's right there.
2 : yeah, that's probably a good move, alright.
3 : yeah
3 : so
3 : i
3 : should i move here or there?
2 : yeah
2 : umm
3 : does it it doesn't really matter.
2 : it do yeah, so alright.
1 : yeah, it doesn't
3 : i'll just do this one
3 : so then, yeah shore up
2 : both of them.
3 : and then that's my whole turn.
2 : yeah
2 : nice job.
3 : yup
2 : alright
2 : two treasure cards.
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : and two of these cards.
3 : ok, gold gate and lost lagoon
2 : oh
3 : there's lost lagoon oh no
2 : oh 
3 : ok so that one goes back over there.
2 : alright
1 : umm
2 : you're up again?
1 : lost lagoon.
3 : ok i have two helicopter lift cards now, so
3 : anyone thinks of a time that we can use these?
1 : yay
2 : umm
1 : i feel like i should start going over here since i have two and then you have one
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah that might be smart.
1 : and then
2 : uh actually if you use the helicopter
1 : oh yeah
2 : i'm not sure like if we have enough helicopter lifts if we wanna use it too early, but
2 : if you moved us both here then i could go over here then
3 : ok
3 : i'll just do that
3 : so to this one?
3 : ok
2 : yeah, i guess
1 : wait
2 : if you're, if you're, if you wanna do that or
1 : oh
1 : yeah, that's fine
3 : ok, and then you could,
3 : you can take all your actions still
2 : yeah
3 : cause it this isn't
3 : an action card.
2 : yeah it's special.
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : uh
1 : i don't know what to do.
1 : shore up, uh give a treasure card.
3 : yeah i guess there's
1 : do you does anybody
1 : mm
1 : if i
1 : give
1 : who would know
1 : umm
1 : i guess it would be better for me to give you this
3 : you can just give that to him.
1 : and you have two.
2 : uh ok
1 : so we're closer.
3 : but now you have five cards, so
2 : yeah
3 : be careful.
2 : and i can't give this sandbag card
1 : yeah
2 : but do you want
2 : like,
2 : do you want me to use this now on the lost lagoon?
2 : or
2 : or we'll see what happens with
3 : yeah
2 : this?
1 : yeah sure ok and is that it?
2 : ok
3 : ok so now
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, that's it.
2 : alright
3 : so
1 : thanks
1 : ok so i have
3 : nice
1 : three of that.
2 : alright, we
2 : alright.
1 : and then
2 : that's good.
3 : ok
1 : this and then
1 : i do this right?
2 : yeah, two of those
3 : yeah two
1 : so, iron gate
1 : and temple of the moon.
3 : this is iron gate
2 : temple of the moon
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : alright
1 : ok
2 : so, my turn.
2 : umm, so
3 : are you gonna move
3 : to
3 : the sun?
2 : yeah
2 : and
2 : i wish, i really wish i could give this away,
2 : but
2 : umm
3 : but
3 : so can you discard that
3 : so you have
1 : i
1 : i think it's when you like pull or something
3 : or you
3 : so you have to draw two cards, yeah
2 : yeah
3 : so you're
3 : i think you can
3 : hmm
3 : ok
3 : ok yeah, you must immediately choose and discard extra cards, so
2 : umm
2 : yeah, umm
1 : mmhmm.
2 : i guess we'll
2 : uh if i
2 : like i don't think i'll be able to use it if i have to choose the discard so
2 : umm guess it's a matter of
2 : 
2 : i
2 : might
2 : uh
2 : uh
2 : should i place it on the lost lagoon or?
1 : or you should put it like on this one, cause that one actually has like one of the
2 : on the iron gate
1 : the treasure things.
2 : umm
3 : mmhmm
3 : you're
2 : does
2 : oh, the temple of the moon.
3 : yeah
3 : ok so
2 : uh
1 : either, either one of those.
3 : even though that's not an action, like do you wanna do it right now?
2 : umm
3 : you might as well.
1 : uh yeah
2 : i guess, yeah
3 : ok
3 : so yeah, that goes there.
2 : and
2 : do you want
2 : do you think
2 : i should give this to do you want this or?
3 : yeah
3 : yeah, ok.
2 : ok
2 : great.
3 : yeah and then you pick up your two.
2 : alright
3 : ok
2 : well
3 : oh no
2 : crap
2 : ok
2 : and i have to draw three now.
2 : huh
2 : oops
2 : uh
2 : cliffs of abandon, breaker's bridge, and temple of the moon.
2 : temple of the moon.
2 : and in breaker's bridge.
3 : ok
2 : ok
3 : ok, so now
3 : it's my turn.
2 : yeah
3 : so the first thing i will do is give you this card.
2 : umm
2 : umm
2 : you have to be on the same space as her to do that.
3 : oh yeah, oh no.
1 : oh yeah
3 : ok well i can move, so i can use that as my action.
2 : yeah,
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : so there
3 : wait
3 : should i
3 : put these
3 : shore up first?
3 : as my
2 : umm, i, i don't think they're likely to be flooded on the next turn so
3 : one of them.
2 : i think you can
3 : so don't worry about it?
2 : yeah i
3 : ok
1 : ok
3 : so just
3 : move here
1 : mmhmm
3 : as my flying
2 : that's t that's
2 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : and then i can give you this
1 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : so that's two actions, should i take one more action?
2 : umm
3 : there's nothing else i mean i could move.
3 : i can move here,
2 : to the
3 : just in case i get one of these.
2 : yeah, that might be a good call.
3 : ok
3 : so now it's your turn.
3 : engineer
1 : ok, so
2 : oh
2 : two cards.
3 : oh yeah
1 : oh yeah
1 : ok
3 : i keep forgetting about these things.
3 : ok
2 : nice
3 : so now i have five cards.
2 : alright, and three of these cards.
3 : oh no!
3 : i'm scared
2 : yeah
3 : iron gate
2 : goodbye
3 : oh no
3 : whispering garden is one
1 : that one
2 : ok
3 : and then lost lagoon
2 : oh
1 : yeah that's gone.
3 : oh no
3 : ok so that one goes, sorry
3 : back over there.
2 : ok
1 : ok so it's four right, so i can
2 : yeah
3 : so you can
3 : you take the treasure.
2 : uh, take the treasure
1 : ok
2 : alright, we have that one, yeah
1 : is this one, where do i put it?
2 : uh, i guess in
1 : in there?
1 : i don't know
3 : umm
2 : uh
3 : well
3 : i guess you can just put it near your stuff
2 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : and this goes
1 : over
1 : in the discard?
2 : umm
3 : or does it
3 : talk about capturing
3 : ok, capture a treasure
3 : you may capture a treasure by discarding, yeah
3 : so they go here
1 : so this card
2 : to the treasure discard pile
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : alright, nice
2 : uh
3 : and then when you capture a treasure
3 : yup
3 : ok
1 : ok umm
3 : ok, now, so that's one action. so you have two more
1 : and then i can
2 : uh do you want to
1 : do you want me to just
2 : uh
2 : shore up, uh, these areas.
3 : yeah, if you move,
3 : if you move here,
3 : you use one action to move here, then you can shore up
1 : and
1 : those two, ok
2 : both of em, yeah.
3 : yeah
1 : so that's
1 : two and then
2 : shore up makes three, alright.
3 : yeah, ok.
1 : there
2 : three cards.
1 : so those two and then
2 : ok
3 : mm
3 : three
1 : two,
1 : three.
1 : so howling
1 : garden, crimson forest, and copper gate.
2 : garden
3 : there's a crimson
2 : crimson forest is
3 : oh it's right here
3 : got it.
2 : ok
3 : and then those go over there.
2 : alright, so, my turn, umm
2 : hmm, umm
3 : so you can give
3 : your treasure cards
3 : away
2 : umm
3 : but we both have one of these.
1 : yeah
3 : so, i mean you can give us each one.
2 : umm
3 : and that's two actions.
2 : umm
2 : ok, umm
3 : or something
3 : or you can give both of them to
3 : oh wait.
3 : yeah you can give one
3 : to someone on one action and the same
3 : to the other to the same person 
2 : i just realized that
2 : uh probably should
2 : probably
2 : no, no, never mind that's probably, that's the best turn that would, would've been possible. umm so
2 : uh
2 : hmm
3 : well
3 : you can give her two cards but i can't take any cards
3 : so you,
1 : yeah
3 : you might as well just give her both of those cards.
1 : but like i don't, we're not on the same oh!
3 : oh yeah
1 : is yours the one that can go to
2 : well i can, i can give you, i can give you at anytime but i can't receive unless we're on the same tile
1 : oh
1 : you can uh
3 : oh, ok, so you can just give
3 : her those cards since you're the messenger.
2 : uh, you want both of them?
3 : so that's two
3 : yeah that would be two actions.
2 : umm
1 : or you could give, like, ok, ok, that's fine.
3 : good
2 : uh, because i
3 : cause i have five cards so i can't take any
2 : ok
2 : because uh,
2 : uh, uh, the thing i was thinking of was to use two actions to move here
3 : mmhmm
2 : then shore this up,
2 : then on the next turn, like
3 : ok yeah
2 : by then, hopefully we'll have all the things and then come back here
2 : and
2 : two actions and then claim that treasure.
3 : that's a good idea well
3 : mm
3 : you'll have to discard
3 : one of those cards.
3 : why don't you give her one card
2 : umm, ok, do you want
3 : like what should we shoot for?
2 : k we have
2 : one,
3 : first
1 : you should probably give me that one, since i'm on that one, or something, i don't know.
2 : alright
2 : here ya go
3 : ok
2 : and
1 : yeah
2 : now
2 : do i wait?
3 : no, no
3 : that was one action, right?
2 : yeah
3 : so now you can move
3 : if you wanted to move over here.
2 : but
2 : this would take two actions and
3 : yeah
2 : that's already my turn
2 : and that
2 : discounts the purpose of being there.
3 : or i can lift you
2 : oh boy
3 : so i could move you
3 : or, or you, i can move anyone,
3 : or myself.
3 : but i wanna give you this purple card so i wanna stay
2 : yeah
3 : with you.
2 : so
3 : so i can move both of us
2 : ok, that's probably a good idea.
3 : should i move both of us maybe here?
2 : yeah that
3 : and then you can
2 : umm
3 : or maybe over here, i don't know, that's really far.
2 : umm
2 : since like
2 : umm
2 : water's there, umm
2 : here's pro
3 : cause we don't have this card means nothing to us now cause we don't need that
2 : yeah
2 : so
2 : i think
3 : or, or this one
2 : umm, i think that here's
3 : so moving both of us here
3 : using the helicopter lift.
2 : ye
2 : yeah, here's probably
3 : and i can i also have a sandbag
2 : 
2 : oh
3 : if i were to use one of these, like
3 : i guess you could give me
3 : a card
2 : i think
3 : as an action
2 : umm
2 : i'm not sure, uh
3 : so i, i would either move both of us or sandbag a random thing
3 : or you can take your actions to do something.
2 : umm
2 : like i don't really have no, i don't really think it
2 : there's much i could do with my actions, so
3 : yeah, so should i just,
1 : alright, then
3 : should i lift us here
3 : and then you can flip this?
3 : shore it up?
2 : ok
3 : cause then you're so close, you know?
3 : right?
2 : yeah, i guess
2 : ok
2 : let's do that.
3 : and then you can, you pick up two cards.
3 : ok, so
2 : and, shore this up.
2 : and then two cards
2 : ah
2 : ok
2 : you know, i think this part of the game is annoying because
2 : it's the same cards getting recycled and that ov over and over again. so three
3 : yeah, it's sad
3 : oh
1 : mm
3 : ooo
2 : cliffs of abandon, howling garden, and breaker's bridge.
3 : ok so
3 : oh we would've lost that
2 : alright
3 : ok
3 : so now it's my turn.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yup
3 : so
3 : i'm gonna give you this.
2 : cool, thank you.
3 : should i shore this
3 : up?
3 : and then should i fly somewhere else?
3 : or should i fly somewhere else and then shore
2 : that's
2 : uh
3 : cause you we just, we could lose this.
3 : so should i shore this up as one action?
2 : yeah that might be a good idea.
1 : yeah you should
3 : ok
3 : and then i can fly, or fly anyone else
3 : or no i can fly myself
2 : uh
3 : cause i'm the pilot, but i don't have the
3 : lift anymore.
3 : so i can fly
3 : myself
3 : in this vicinity,
3 : just in case
1 : yeah, sure
3 : so should i fly to this, maybe?
1 : mm
2 : mm
2 : there's not really a point of going to the temple of the moon since
3 : here?
2 : umm
2 : actua i think
2 : like the points that
2 : you're around right now
2 : is pretty advantageous.
3 : ok, so
3 : well what
3 : are we going for, we're going for
2 : we're getting
2 : like the next time
3 : we're gonna get this
2 : yeah
1 : or you can pat or you can
1 : give me
1 : that this
2 : yeah
1 : since i'm on there
3 : oh yeah, ok
2 : yeah, that's a good idea.
3 : ok
2 : ok
3 : alright
1 : oh wait, no, we can't do that, we can't do that
2 : whoa wait
3 : oh, no, no, no, no
2 : so you can but you can move yourself there and do that
3 : yeah, yeah
3 : oh yeah, i can move myself
1 : and then
1 : we can do it later
3 : yes
1 : ok
1 : so it's my turn?
1 : no, you have to do that
2 : wait, how many actions did you take?
1 : she did
1 : three
2 : uh
1 : right?
3 : i gave you one and i
2 : oh right, giving me, shoring that up and then there, ok, right, sorry.
3 : flipped one up and then i moved. ok, three.
1 : and then she moved
3 : so
1 : ok, then you can do
1 : that
2 : alright, so your treasures
3 : ok, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : i keep forgetting about the treasures
2 : yeah and
2 : 
2 : ok, helicopter lift, that's good.
3 : alright
2 : those things, that's also good, she can
3 : mmhmm
3 : so i can do any, like
2 : but, wait
3 : if a
2 : then you'd have to discard one of the things
2 : if she gave you that and i gave you
2 : this. but if we try to go for that
3 : yeah
3 : ok, so, i need to do those
3 : still
2 : alright, yeah, three.
3 : so three
3 : and then it'll just be her turn.
3 : ok, temple of the moon,
2 : goodbye
3 : uh whispering garden,
2 : oh
3 : uh oh
2 : crap
3 : and then crimson forest
2 : ok that's fine.
3 : ok so
2 : alright
2 : you're up.
1 : umm
1 : umm
1 : i think i should
3 : so you can,
3 : you can shore up
2 : oh wait, oh
1 : i think i should
2 : wait, umm
1 : move here, one, two
2 : but wait, but wait, umm
2 : i thought the whole purpose was to give me that
3 : oh yeah,
3 : yeah, give
2 : but you'd have to like use up your
3 : oh no, wait
2 : two actions and then that would take up the third action.
2 : umm
1 : what?
3 : wait so can she give you that card if you have
2 : no, she i, i have
2 : like
3 : you have to have room for it
2 : i can give at anytime
2 : but she has to be on the same tile as me.
3 : oh, yeah, ok
3 : so
3 : i mean i could lift.
1 : wait, that i give who what?
2 : this one to me so that on my next turn i can go to here and claim the treasure.
3 : mmhmm
3 : so i could lift her to you
1 : yeah, i think i need to go over here so that i can bring this back, because this is
2 : or,
3 : cause we're gonna need to go in here
3 : or here
2 : like
3 : to get the
3 : last
1 : wait, yo, oh ok, ok, one, two, three.
3 : the third one, yeah.
3 : cause, yeah
2 : like, you don't have to go over there cause there's
2 : ok
3 : oh yeah
3 : ok
3 : oh yeah, i forgot
3 : so
3 : should we just not?
2 : yeah
3 : just leave that?
2 : just leave that
3 : i mean, cause we just need to, we need to keep these ones, yeah.
1 : ok, i'll just do these,
1 : i'll just put these up.
2 : ok
1 : so that we don't get like
3 : yeah
3 : so that's one action
2 : k
3 : and then
2 : and then
3 : i mean i can,
3 : should i fly her to you so you
1 : and
3 : or wait?
1 : wait, one, two. so can i i can't even give this to you though, because you have five?
2 : that's
2 : you can
3 : or do you discard it?
2 : i think
2 : i think i can
2 : discard
2 : but
2 : umm
3 : yeah, in order to accept a card, if you already have five cards you must discard one.
3 : so
2 : yeah
3 : should i helicopter lift her
3 : to you?
2 : umm
3 : and then she can give you the card
3 : as a second action.
2 : yeah
2 : i
2 : are you ok with that or
1 : yeah, that's fine.
3 : yeah that, i mean i don't know what else we can do.
2 : alright
3 : ok, so engineer
2 : ok
3 : and then
2 : alright, i'll get rid of this and
3 : yeah you give
3 : him the earth
2 : alright
3 : yup, there you go
3 : so you have one more action
3 : but
1 : i think that
