1 : guys, you're gonna have to help coach me.
3 : ok
1 : k.
4 : mk.
1 : k, so i can move anywhere
4 : so, you are up first.
4 : yeah, so your power is to shore stuff up.
1 : right.
4 : so i wouldn't really worry with the lost lagoon, cause i don't think we're gonna go out that direction much anyways, so i don't really care if we lose that tile, right?
1 : ok
1 : so go here.
2 : maybe you could
3 : yeah, yeah.
4 : yeah, so i think that's probably your best bet.
1 : and then i wanna shore up these two.
4 : yeah, i'd agree.
4 : and then you have one more action, you could let's see, so you have the two chalices and who's over here, who's gray, you? that's the messenger. umm
1 : making a mess
1 : so would i wanna go with her?
4 : eh, it doesn't really matter cause none of us have the helicopter card and we're just trying
4 : move around. your best bet might be
1 : but she can give me a card though. no it doesn't matter. ok, it doesn't matter.
2 : you could, you could
4 : she has nothing to give you yet, yeah, you might pull the card you want. you should probably move to breaker's bridge in like, just in case, so that if it does get
3 : oh
1 : ok
4 : flooded. and then so you have to draw
4 : two treasure cards
4 : and hopefully not a flood rise's this early.
1 : ok
4 : yup.
1 : mm
1 : ok, great.
2 : figures.
1 : so i have to do this
4 : yeah
2 : shuffle these,
2 : i think.
4 : oh yeah weren't we supposed to start with forbidden island, uh
1 : what?
4 : cards already thrown away, or is that the
2 : these were the ones that were discarded.
4 : yeah, ok we're still ok, didn't know, oh yeah, the , alright that makes sense.
1 : ok
1 : so i just take two
4 : oh that is really sadistic.
3 : mm
1 : k
1 : and then breaker's bridge. so it's
4 : so yeah you're gonna have to swim.
1 : so now what?
1 : so i have to   discard this.
4 : yeah you can choose any of the, yeah, any of the adjacent tiles.
4 : yes so these go
1 : and move anywhere.
4 : you p
4 : probably, that's probably better than
1 : k
1 : cliffs of abandon
4 : getting them lost
4 : that's this one.
3 : where was it?
1 : where's that one? so i have to flood that one?
4 : yup
1 : ok
4 : ok
4 : cool.
1 : and then
4 : so this one's out of the game, that's not too bad
1 : get rid of this,
1 : these both
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah, no just those, just that one. and we uh we moved the and we already moved the water's rise up. ok. so it's one turn.
2 : this one, this one comes over here.
1 : just this one, ok. cause i can hold five.
2 : and uh, yeah.
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : alright
2 : so
4 : let's see, where's messenger? you're over here.
2 : no for me.
4 : umm
2 : well i can
2 : i can move
4 : yeah
2 : and i could
4 : you could shore up that one, yeah.
2 : shore this guy up here.
4 : and then
4 : that would be a good idea.
2 : one,
2 : who's
2 : there's two moves
4 : two moves
2 : what else?
4 : and then i could
2 : i could
4 : take your, we could i could take your, your statue, or i could give it to you either way. oh i'm trying to remember if your special move
2 : this doesn't count as a f, as a
4 : counts
3 : mm
2 : sp i don't know, does it, does it count as umm
4 : as a move.
4 : i'm trying think, i'm trying remember if it
4 : does.
1 : look on the back of your messenger thing.
4 : let's see
1 : does it say on there?
2 : uh
4 : engineer can shore messenger can give a single card per action oh yeah, so yeah.
2 : yeah.
4 : so it does count as an action.
4 : so you can give that to me at any time, let's just wait and see, let's see who gets the more of the earth statue cards.
2 : alright.
2 : alright, so then i have to pull two of these.
4 : well yeah, well you have to make your third action i think.
2 : you can do up to three.
4 : oh up to three, yeah.
3 : oh ok.
2 : so do you think i'm good?
1 : oh you don't have to do three?
2 : you can do up to three.
4 : let's see, that's a good question. yeah, choose, well it says choose three, uh oh yeah
2 : right here.
1 : take up to three actions.
2 : mmhmm
4 : oh yeah, you're right. ok cool.
3 : oh ok.
2 : so i think i'm good, you guys think so?
4 : yeah, sweet.
4 : umm
2 : so i can take
2 : two?
4 : yeah, probably.
1 : so don't take it if it's gonna hurt you.
4 : yeah, honestly it does if you can't think of anything to do. you
2 : i've got
4 : oh yeah, so no, you've got the earth statue, ok.
2 : this dude
2 : and sandbags.
4 : perfect, so save the sandbags for now
2 : alright.
2 : and
4 : till we get
2 : now i've gotta
4 : well
3 : well no,
3 : cause we didn't
4 : yeah let's see, let's see, what could get flooded again? cause we got lost lagoon, we don't really
3 : ok, yeah.
4 : any of these could get lost, they're not really important, they're all on the edge, so we should save the sandbags.
4 : so yeah
2 : well i think, i think we can just
2 : not do anything with this, i have to take
4 : yeah
2 : the three cards now though.
4 : yeah, i was just, yeah. if you, you could well the thing is, yeah the thing is you can use the sandbags before you draw them but like i was just considering like we don't need to cause if we
1 : two,
1 : just two.
2 : oh two, two.
4 : lose any of those,
2 : yeah, they're kind of on the outer edges at this point too, so we're probably
4 : yeah, they don't matter.
4 : but yeah, but once you draw them you can't use sandbags.
2 : pretty good
4 : so yeah let's see what they
2 : ok
2 : i've got temple of the moon and the gold gate.
2 : uh
3 : that's gone.
4 : ok
2 : gold gate's outta here.
4 : yeah, so that's fine.
3 : yeah.
1 : k
2 : and you flipped temple of the moon?
4 : yes.
1 : mmhmm.
4 : sweet.
4 : ok
3 : ok, now my turn.
4 : looks like you're up.
4 : so pilot can go anywhere.
3 : uh, i can go anywhere.
3 : what i could do is go here
3 : and flip that over.
4 : you let's see
2 : ok
4 : yeah, that's probably a good idea or
3 : or
4 : cause we ca, we don't really wanna lose temple of the moon.
3 : yeah
4 : but i'm gonna be pretty close to that too. i'm gonna be pretty close to that too, so what i was thinking about doing, i was thinking about
2 : cause it has, it has the,
2 : it has the stone on here.
3 : yeah
4 : moving that way anyways.
4 : umm
4 : but it's gonna, cause of the flood rises thing
4 : well as long as, as long as we don't get the other flood rises's cards we should be ok.
3 : ok, so
4 : so what yeah, just go for it.
4 : why not?
3 : but uh, that's two actions
3 : and i'll leave it
2 : yeah
4 : and then
3 : or no?
4 : ok
4 : is anyone getting close to five cards, yeah you've got four so that's ok,
4 : but let's see
3 : i mean i could go onto her
3 : tile, so on the next move if you get over cumbered
3 : you can give me one.
4 : yeah, let's do that.
2 : mmhmm
4 : but, but she doesn't have to cause it's the messenger too, which is the funny part, but you can do two actions if you yeah, give one to
3 : you're messenger?
3 : yeah
2 : alright
3 : just in case
4 : ok
2 : so two cards
4 : so then let's see
3 : and then two
4 : see if we develop anymore
3 : helicopter
3 : and a chalice.
4 : chalice, ok.
2 : lots of helicopters
3 : yeah
4 : so where are you in relation to him?
4 : if we can get that chalice over, ok.
1 : red
4 : so that's not too far. well i probably we can just kinda drop it at anytime.
3 : ok
4 : so
4 : oh and you have to pull the flood cards for it
3 : and
3 : well we do reshuffle
4 : before i can go
4 : no, cause it wasn't the water rises.
2 : no, that's only with the water's rises.
3 : don't we no, ok.
4 : hopefully
4 : which
3 : lost lagoon,
3 : and phantom rock.
2 : ok
3 : so,
1 : lost lagoon's
2 : phantom
1 : gone.
2 : oh man!
3 : rock gone.
4 : that's so yeah 
3 : we're sinking
2 : we're losing our island.
4 : these are ok, ok losses though. you just wanna protect the ones that are on the inside.
3 : lost lagoon,
1 : now like why didn't you use that one of the helicopter cards, cause we only need one?
2 : did
4 : yeah, well
3 : oh
1 : like why didn't you use one?
1 : can you still?
3 : oh
4 : hmm, you can use one anytime, that's the thing, you can move any of these guys
1 : oh, it's not an action?
1 : so like
4 : yeah, so we should
1 : can't you, he use one of those?
3 : so i could use it right now if i wanted to.
4 : well i'd save it, i'd save like let's wait till we have a few more cards like that are like if we have like a bunch of islands that are flipped cause then we could just move both these guys here, and if it's your turn next like you could kind of free up a couple.
2 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : so we'll use that like as an emergency to move the engineer somewhere.
1 : so say that
3 : emergency safe
1 : ok
4 : yeah, cause if we could just move
3 : vehicle.
1 : because you can hold five so just keep it.
4 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok
4 : and you can use it at anytime so like you can use it right before your turn if
3 : ok
4 : if i draw like a flood rises and everything starts sinking.
1 : ok
2 : ok
4 : so now i go, let's see, so i'm here.
4 : what should i do? so i have
4 : this
4 : umm ok
4 : let's see how close are we, we so you still need one more. do we have a set of four yet? no, we're close, everyone has a set of three.
4 : so
4 : i guess
4 : i'll just move to
4 :  so i have a bunch of actions to use, so let's see, i should probably
4 : t
3 : yeah
4 : give
4 : the do you, well you know you have five,
4 : you have four cards. i could give you the earth chalice and we could plan on using one of the hol-helicopter lifts pretty soon.
3 : we could do that.
4 : yeah, ok, so i'd move
4 : to you. you're the, you're blue right?
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
4 : ok, so that's two actions
4 : umm
3 : now, do i get rid of it now?
3 : or at my turn?
2 : mm
4 : or
2 : your turn
4 : i, ah for the, well yeah, we gotta figure out if we even need these. i'll, i'll do one more so you can say up to three sets and i'll probably just
3 : and my turn, ok?
4 : stay there for now
4 : and
4 : pull out two
4 : , so start with the two treasure cards.
3 : or two?
2 : yeah, yeah.
4 : ok
4 : so i've got
4 : ok, so we've almost got a set.
2 : well we, we do now, once we
1 : we do.
4 : yeah, once, once it all gets transferred over, so that's convenient. ok.
4 : and then
4 : the
4 : flood cards too.
4 : let's see what's sinking.
4 : looks like whispering garden and iron gate.
3 : iron gate.
2 : whispering garden's up top.
4 : it's right here, yeah ok.
4 : cool.
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : engineer
1 : mm
4 : we might wanna forget whispering garden.
1 : well
4 : oh wait, you're the way down there though.
1 : yeah
1 : i have to be beside it, right?
4 : yeah, well
4 : or we could use our helicopter lift to but
4 : let's see, where else is the earth statue?
4 : there's one way at the
1 : anybody can use his helicopter lift, or he can only use his helicopter lift?
3 : uh yeah, i think only i can use ok.
4 : only you can use it, yea, but i just mean as a team
1 : ok
1 : ok
4 : or we could use sandbags if we're really concerned.
4 : we could
1 : ss
4 : but
4 : let's see
2 : i mean if you wanted, you can't you move? you can move two spaces at a time, so you could move up two and then
2 : flip
2 : the whispering gardens, cause it's adjacent to you, if you'd like
4 : that would work too, yeah.
1 : i can use i can move twice?
2 : that?
4 : 
2 : right?
4 : yup.
4 : yeah, you can move twice. you either gotta be three actions all together, cause it'd be
2 : i'm pretty sure.
1 : pretty sure
4 : one move,
4 : two moves, and your third action would be flipping the whispering garden.
1 : so these aren't all counted as di i thought you
2 : i thought the engineer can just move two at a time.
1 : i can, no i can
2 : like up to two spaces, right?
1 : no i can flip two cards, i can
3 : oh
1 : choose two tiles.
1 : i can shore up two tiles,
2 : oh
1 : not moving twice.
4 : yeah that's her special, that's her special ability
4 : but you have to be next to them.
1 : right, but if i'm uh you can move twice? because i thought you can pick up to these three actions that you could do.
1 : you can move three times, you can shore up,
1 : you can't
4 : yeah, yeah, eg moves three, move one and shore two, yeah you can move three.
3 : i think so.
2 : yeah, so
1 : i can move, ok, alright.
4 : yeah
4 : as long as it's no more than three. so you can only do three things.
2 : move so you can move, move
1 : alright
1 : so move, move, flip
4 : move and then shore.
2 : and shore up.
1 : ok.
4 : ok and that's pretty, it's a pretty good defensive move. and now we'll find out
2 : there we go.
1 : and then i have to do this.
2 : alright, so two cards we got.
3 : yup.
1 : ok
4 : let's see if water rises comes up.
1 : yup.
3 : oh.
2 : ugh
4 : ok
4 : so
1 : great, so now
4 : you can discard the water ri, or uh we can, doesn't really matter what order's on if we
1 : uh
4 : move it up and then shuffle the cards and put em on top.
1 : i have to do this.
1 : great.
4 : let's see how we do.
1 : i take three.
1 : alright, iron gate,
4 : temple of the moon, i see.
3 : gone.
1 : gone.
2 : goodness.
1 : did you do 
1 : temple moon
4 : yeah, and i flipped it already.
1 : and then cliffs of abandon.
3 : oh, where was it?
4 : cliffs of abandon
2 : here we go.
4 : yeah, ok, right in the center.
1 : oh
2 : alright.
2 : oh dear.
4 : ok, well cliffs of abandon isn't really that
1 : i have this
1 : this
4 : big of a deal. it's a nice stepping stone though.
1 : this
4 : ok, so now we're all in the same
2 : alright
4 : tile, so messenger
2 : so my turn.
4 : yeah.
2 : alright
2 : so
2 : i can move
1 : and flip
2 : and i can
2 : do this one?
1 : mmhmm
4 : yup and you can do the one you're doing at yeah.
2 : and then count this as my third one too.
4 : if you want to
2 : alright, so there's my,
2 : there's my three moves.
2 : so now i gotta pick up two of these
4 : yup
2 : i have this
4 : more sandbags, ok that's good.
2 : and another sandbag.
4 : that's good.
2 : so
3 : alright
4 : oh, but ok, so you have, you have an extra cards.
2 : oh, i have an extra. i have six cards now, i gotta get rid of something.
3 : mmhmm
3 : could you use no.
4 : yeah, we should.
4 : yeah, you can,  could we use a sandbag, nah
2 : well what, what do we do with the
1 : get rid of that.
3 : but you, there's nothing
1 : right, i was just gonna say, get rid of that one.
4 : yeah, get rid of that.
2 : why don't i get cause it looks like we're g we're on the way.
1 : mmhmm
4 : let's just, let's just plan on getting on the is ah getting off the island without the uh, yeah.
3 : yeah
2 : so do i just discard here?
1 : mmhmm.
3 : yeah.
4 : let's just plan on getting off the island without that
2 : alrighty
2 : and then i gotta take three cards.
4 : yeah
4 : let's hopefully nothing
2 : two, three.
2 : umm, i got the crimson forest, the temple of the sun, and the whispering gardens.
4 : ok.
3 :  temple of the sun
1 : temple of the sun
1 : you got it? whispering gardens? you got that one too?
2 : ok
4 : there's no, ok, there's no reason that we couldn't
4 : basically ok.
2 : we can, we can get those back in, in shape.
4 : yeah, we can, so what we should do. so you have
3 : oh
2 : so it's your turn now though
4 : enough. we're on the same place though right?
4 : yeah, ok cool.
4 : cause i'm gonna give you this card when it's my turn i think.
2 : i gotta get rid of something though, don't i?
4 : k
4 : yeah, well it's we can use the sandbags at any point. we can do it now even? yeah, i think
2 : can i just get rid of
2 : oh, play it anytime. true.
4 : yeah, so we can use it for this guy and this guy and then you'd have
4 : plenty of space.
2 : k
4 : just cause that way,
4 : but we can wait.
2 : why don't we just do
2 : well let's do whispering can i do it now?
4 : yeah, but why don't we wait till the next, yeah.
2 : we'll wait till you're handing it to me. alright.
3 : ok.
4 : well, actually before that. probably wh if he gets another flood rises card we'll do, we'll do it before then cause they can't be
3 : huh
2 : alright
2 : you go ahead, then.
4 : drawn as it stands.
3 : ok
2 : pilot
3 : i have two helicopters and i well i have six
3 : cards, so one has to be get
3 : taken care of. i can use helicopter
2 : well this is just your like regular card.
4 : oh yeah that doesn't count, yeah.
3 : oh, never mind.
1 : yeah that doesn't count.
2 : i'm just gonna put this like over here so we, yeah.
3 : whoops, yeah.
4 : yeah
4 : yep
4 : that doesn't count.
2 : alright
3 : umm
3 : so i mean
2 : well you can fly somewhere
4 : yeah well it'd be more purposeful to fly someone else but yeah we should keep the helicopter lifts and then let's see
4 : ok, so you should give your chalice to her
4 : probably, that's one turn.
2 : yeah
2 : so one
3 : so one
4 : cause
4 : yeah cause i'm gonna give you a chalice as well.
1 : k
1 : k
4 : just get ready to discard that, probably that.
1 : k
2 : the fire.
3 : chali
4 : flames thing, yeah.
2 : uh
3 : where should i go? i mean it
2 : you
2 : well maybe we want maybe, maybe, y well you're the pilot so you can just fly so maybe you wanna fly here and flip that.
3 : yeah, i was thinking i could fly
4 : yeah just
3 : so thats
4 : so that's your seconda action and then
3 : two,
4 : well yeah, that works perfect.
3 : three could be
2 : yeah, there's three.
3 : flip over.
1 : hmm
4 : sweet.
2 : alright, so now two of these.
3 : mm
4 : ok they all have to discard some things so get rid of that.
4 : flame.
3 : yeah.
4 : cause we're not leaving the island with that, i don't think.
3 : and then, three
1 : three
2 : two and three
2 : there you go.
3 : ok.
2 : what do you have?
3 : so silver gate,
2 : up there
3 : tidal palace,
3 : and then copper gate.
3 : right here,
3 : wait no.
4 : ok
2 : alright
4 : so
2 : here you can just put those in the discard
4 : that'll be my turn.
2 : or i mean in the flood discard
3 : yes, that's right
2 : alright.
3 : mmhmm
4 : mm
2 : your turn, explorer.
4 : why don't
4 : yeah cause i'm gonna give you a card, why don't we use sandbags to free up
2 : alright
2 : so first thing,
4 : umm
4 : which one can i not get to? i can get to this one and free this one up. i can free up this
2 : so why don't you like
4 : let's see
2 : free up something first.
4 : yeah, ok, so i'll free up the most important one cause i know we're gonna need this one.
2 : yeah
4 : unless we're gonna get all the way down to howling garden.
2 : ok
4 : which
4 : the pilot would have to do that.
2 : you're green, right?
4 : yeah, so i used one action and then another action
4 : i'm gonna give you well you should use sandbags so i can give you this.
2 : ok, i'll use sandbags on
4 : probably that one, cause it's got something on it.
2 : ok, we'll use it on tidal palace.
3 : yeah.
4 : and then, so i'll give this my second action and then
2 : so that's your second action and you can,
2 : you can free up one more if you want.
4 : my third action i was actually gonna give her this card so she can take the chalice, but to do that you have to get rid of the fire.
3 : oh, right, yeah.
2 : oh
2 : alright, good thinking.
1 : k
1 : k
4 : crystal.
1 : when it's my turn?
4 : yeah oh, either well, cause you have five cards it doesn't matter you have to discard it what does it say? yeah you have to if you already have five cards you must discard one.
1 : right?
1 : right
1 : right
2 : just check though.
3 : think
2 : they have to be s on the same tile as you.
4 : oh oh, we're not are we on the same tile?
1 : it has to be the same tile.
3 : oh, oh, you have to be
2 : crap!
4 : oh, the pilot, oh i wasn't on the same tile
1 : oh, hmm
4 : as
4 : oh yeah, i wasn't on the same tile as you. ok, yeah.
2 : well you can move to the same tile as you could've
1 : no wait
3 : no wait, you're green red, yeah.
1 : you're on the same tile as me.
4 : i'm on the same tile as you but not you.
2 : you're on the same tile.
1 : yeah
2 : but not me, so you have,
1 : that's fine.
4 : yeah
4 : so let's see
2 : so you would have to move to the same tile as me.
4 : yeah give it
4 : back, i'll figure it out. so let's see, i flipped one, i used one turn,
1 : ok
2 : alright
2 : what was your first
4 : so i have two turns so i can only
4 : move at that point or
1 : and you flipped one.
2 : so you shouldn't have flipped, so you should not have flipped one.
4 : well i, i think we need this, this is more important. cause oh, unless you want to use sandbags again?
4 : and then
4 : that would save me another turn, if you wanna do that and just use
4 : discard sandbags
4 : and then i can get you this as well.
2 : well you we
3 : i can give you back sand
4 : well, we already used one sandbags for this one
3 : if you, ok.
3 : oh, that's right, ok.
4 : i'm, i'm suggesting that if we use another sandbags we can get rid of this and then that, you have this card.
1 : right, because i have to be on that tile to use these. wait no i have to be on a
2 : what if we really need sandbags later though?
4 : yeah
1 : i have to be on this tile.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah, that's the thing too, what if we really need sandbags?
2 : well fine then, let's just not use the sandbags for this one, and what instead we would've used sandbags for the whispering garden.
3 : yeah
4 : ok
4 : yeah, ok.
2 : so you're first so you're one turn.
4 : that's fine
2 : would be
2 : first you give her the
4 : yeah
2 : thing
2 : then
4 : yeah, so i already did that. one,
3 : mm
2 : move to the same one as me as your second,
4 : yeah, and then i'll give you the
2 : so now you can give me this.
3 : oh ok.
4 : yeah ok, and then you're gonna have to once it's your turn you're gonna have to try and get up here.
2 : alright
1 : ah
2 : yeah
4 : and get to that.
4 : and, so the chalice is your next place is gonna try to get here.
2 : alright, well
3 : you can go or
4 : so if i get, if i get flood rises, yeah so i gotta uh take ah ok yeah so i'll take two cards.
2 : let's do the next thing cause we're running low on time.
3 : 
1 : i know
1 : ok so how do i get
1 : to a ch
1 : to here?
4 : yeah i just have to take two cards.
2 : you gotta get to a chalice.
4 : yeah that's
4 : so
1 : right, that's what i'm saying, i can't.
2 : where are you?
1 : and
4 : you'll be able to, in a sec.
3 : oh you're red. one, two, three.
2 : what are you?
1 : red.
4 : yeah.
4 : we'll find a way, yeah. hey pass me
3 : or
2 : there's only three s things though
3 : but remember i can fly her
2 : and you have six
4 : wait yeah, i have, i have to take two cards first. we can't move yet.
2 : you have six cards you have to get rid of this as well?
1 : ok, get rid of this one.
4 : yeah, yeah.
2 : yeah.
4 : so i have to grab
4 : yeah, you can't move yet though, i have to do the two cards and then
3 : oh.
1 : oh, i'm sorry.
3 : k, here's your two cards.
4 : yeah, oh that's what i was kind of worried about. worter water rises.
3 : ah.
1 : i thought it was my turn.
4 : so we gotta shuffle those
4 : over there
4 : put that back in there
2 : and besides, we could always use a helicopter, right?
3 : over here
3 : yeah,
3 : because then i could just fly her to the coral place.
2 : and then we'll get our first treasure.
4 : yeah.
3 : yeah
4 : ok
4 : exactly
4 : so, these three are crimson forest, copper gate, and temple of the sun.
4 : so t wait temple of the sun.
2 : crimson forest is gone.
3 : these two are gone.
4 : yeah
4 : these two are gone, yeah.
4 : t
4 : ok.
2 : k
3 : and i flipped the temple of the sun already.
4 : and then temple of the sun. ok, so that goes back over there.
1 : ok
1 : alright
1 : my turn.
2 : alright so it's
4 : now it's your turn.
2 : it is your turn now.
1 : now i have to get to this chalice to collect it.
4 : ok
2 : we can use the helicopter to get there.
4 : yeah
3 : i'm gonna use a helicopter so you don't have to use any of your moves.
1 : ok
4 : ok
3 : and i can move her
4 : so that's coral palace.
3 : to coral pal. you're red so
1 : mmhmm
3 : move to coral palace.
1 : move here?
4 : ok, so then your first action's gonna be
2 : so we have to discard heli
2 : copter.
4 : to get the treasure. and then your second and third action should probably get to fool's landing but i'm not sure.
1 : i t
1 : so i take all the
4 : that's my guess
4 : but yes, that can be your first action.
2 : well
2 : we have to fly away at the end, so
2 : why don't we
4 : yeah
2 : maybe she could move and then flip.
1 : how do i get the treasure though?
4 : yeah, that works, that's a good one.
3 : you have it.
2 : well you
1 : ok
2 : you that just counts as one move.
4 : yeah, technically.
3 :  it's one of your
1 : take these
4 : yeah
2 : yup
4 : and
2 : so you got it now, so we can just
3 : right
4 : probably put those in discard, yeah.
2 : discard here.
1 : ok
2 : alright so
1 : so that
1 : but that was my second move.
2 : that was one action.
4 : that was one move, cause he
1 : that was only one?
4 : yeah, his, his helicopter lift was a
2 : yeah that
3 : cause my helicopter
1 : alright
2 : yeah
2 : so now
3 : took care of you.
2 : maybe perhaps move here and flip.
1 : move here to turn this
4 : and then flip temple.
4 : yeah, that's a good one.
2 : good.
3 : ok
2 : so now you need two of these.
4 : so now,
1 : ok
4 : so tidal palace doesn't really matter anymore cause we got the chalice.
3 : ok
1 : ok, i got a lift and another one of these.
3 : good, ok.
4 : oh cool.
1 : alright, we got four, not we got four we got three treasures if we hurry up.
2 : sweet
3 : we got
2 : alright
2 : now
2 : umm, we need
1 : i have to take three, crap.
2 : three of these.
2 : there you go.
2 : hopefully we didn't lose anything too important.
4 : yeah, this'll work.
1 : ok, alright. tidal palace,
3 : gone
2 : good, cause we don't need that anymore.
2 : well, not good, but
1 : silver gate,
2 : what was it? silver gate's gone too?
1 : gone
4 : yeah, that's fine.
1 : and temple of the moon.
2 : and then
4 : thats's fine, we can
1 : k
4 : stomach that. ok
1 : alright, go ahead.
2 : well, we better, ok.
4 : so you're messenger right? ok.
2 : alright, so now it's my turn.
1 : wait we need to get to here.
4 : can you get, yeah can you get to whispering garden and turn in?
2 : where?
4 : that'd be here, or down there.
2 : where am i?
4 : so you can get to
2 : alright, so i'll do
4 : let's see where are you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2 : one,
4 : two, and then you get a treasure.

2 : here we go.
4 : ok
2 : we got two treasures.
3 : that's your treasure.
4 : yup
4 : ok, now let's see if we can
2 : so now i gotta
2 : collect two of these cards here.
4 : 
2 : i have two fires, uh that's not that helpful.
3 : fire fire
1 : k
4 : yeah, whatever
2 : and now i take
1 : three
1 : three
2 : three of these.
2 : we have
2 : cliffs of abandon,
2 : whispering garden,
2 : dunces of deception.
4 : cliffs of abandon
2 : and whispering garden is what i'm on.
4 : whispering garden's what you're on. yeah
2 : i'm ok there right? alright good. i don't wanna just wanna make sure i don't have to swim anywhere.
1 : k mmhmm
4 : yeah
4 : even-yeah, even if you do, we'll be fine cause we got the
2 : alright
4 : treasure too.
3 : mmhmm
2 : go ahead, pilot.
4 : ok, so let's see if we can find a devisive way
3 : pile
4 : cause you've got those two.
3 : i mean i can, i can
2 : what if
1 : yeah you 
2 : you could just one, two,
4 : yeah
2 : give em
3 : take one move
2 : give em to her.
3 : and go to her.
2 : or, or to the uh
1 : two
4 : cause yeah, you can fly anywhere.
2 : the engineer.
1 : right
3 : so i can fly once and for my next two moves, give you two.
4 : and then two moves, perfect, that's such a great way to do it, yeah.
1 : aha
2 : yeah
3 : so that way you're, you're set to go.
4 : i was worried i was gonna have to get one down there, that would not have helped.
1 : k
1 : k
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : so you did your three moves
1 : now you have an do you have one more you have one more move, you need it.
4 : nope
3 : no, cause i gave you
2 : no, the flying
1 : oh, oh, oh, oh, ok
4 : cause yeah, each card counts as a move.
1 : ok
3 : no, she's important because she has the treasure and the flying card, so you're like our ace.
4 : yeah
1 : i'm it
4 : you're definitely our, you're definitely our route out of here.
1 : you guys need me.
3 : two treasures
3 : which we don't need and then
3 : i'll take the floods.
2 : we need
2 : there we go.
4 : 
2 : what do we have?
3 : cave of embers,
2 : alright that's right there.
4 : 
3 : bronze gate,
3 : which is right there,
4 : that's probably, yeah.
3 : and cave of shadows.
1 : ok, that's good
4 : no problem
2 : alright, so, you can
2 : can you put these here?
2 : or i mean, i'll-i'll take them out
3 : yeah,
3 : uh no over there, yeah
2 : ok
4 : k
3 : although we have to be careful that
3 : they make it
3 : to us somehow, because they're, they're getting on pretty loose ground.
4 : so cause of your, cause of your helicopter lift we've got a good chance to get someone out, worst comes to worst
1 : i need this.
2 : well
2 : good, cause we still have two
3 : ok
4 : yeah, we still have two so we're definitely gonna get out.
1 : k
2 : uh, i still have a sandbag too if we do need that.
4 : sweet.
3 : oh, you have a sandbag, ok.
4 : that's perfect, so we can use that at anytime. ok, so i'm just gonna go
2 : ok, well it's your turn.
1 : go ahead, explorer.
4 : i'm just gonna make one move and that'll be it.
3 : ok
4 : there's nothing else i can do,
4 : i don't think.
3 : we're not on
4 : i can, i can flip stuff, yeah.
2 : well flip
3 : yeah, i'd flip
4 : i can flip both of these.
1 : mmhmm
3 : for security reasons i would do it.
4 : that's fine, yeah, one
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
4 : two, so there you go and i can get back
2 : so that's your three moves.
4 : yup
2 : so here's your two cards.
4 : mm
4 : more treasures that we don't need and let's see what that has three, yeah.
2 : one,
2 : two,
2 : three, there you go.
4 : ok, it looks like watchtower, misty marsh, and howling garden.
4 : so
2 : watchtower,
3 : watch
2 : where's
4 : there probably all, yeah.
2 : here's the watchtower.
2 : oh
1 : mm watchtower, so your
3 : oh
2 : uh oh
4 : yeah
1 : that's alright, you can swim.
2 : what is it? misty marsh,
4 : yup, misty marsh
2 : and what?
4 : uh watchtower.
2 : we got that, watchtower, misty marsh, and what?
4 : oh sorry the
4 : howling garden, that was the last one.
3 : bottom one.
2 : howling garden, there we go.
1 : k
2 : alright
1 : alright, so i need to be
1 : on this
2 : you need to get to
3 : which is this one.
2 : 
1 : k
3 : so that's one move
2 : so one move
4 : so move
4 : then
4 : two moves,
3 : turn in to get
1 : 
1 : three treasures
3 : your treasure
1 : k and then i can and then what do i like how do i get us to go?
2 : and then
3 : i would
4 : you shh save that, you should probably just move cause we're not really in any
2 : you should
1 : ok
4 : danger, unless you guys wanna like finish fast.
1 : can i should i just turn this over or no, doesn't matter, that card doesn't matter.
4 : no
3 : i mean you could go over here just so that you're on the landing. yeah.
4 : but you can't move diagonally.
1 : cause we all have to be there to fly out.
4 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : wait can you move
4 : but that would no she can't move diagonally, yeah i can i'm the only one that can move, so that'd be the observatory.
3 : ok
2 : the engineer can't move diagonally though, so
3 : oh
1 : wait, i can't what?
2 : you can't move diagonally.
4 : you can't move diagonally.
1 : oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
2 : so
3 : but
4 : i'd say move to the observatory for now, and i think i don't think
1 : k
4 : yeah, i think we're gonna be able to finish the game
1 : alright
2 : alright
4 : pretty quick.
2 : so now, my turn?
4 : umm
4 : well, she's gotta take two cards, right?
1 : oh
3 : oh
2 : oh oops.
1 : two
2 : sorry
4 : yeah, so water rises
3 : oh, well
1 : oh, shoot.
2 : aw
1 : aw
4 : ok, so
4 : let's think
1 : we're still ok, we're at three.
4 : what should we use sandbags on cause your character can't get lost out here.
4 : so if misty marsh falls through before we, before we draw any first you guys shuffle the deck, first.
1 : get rid of that.
1 : oops
2 : well if whispering gardens does too, that's not,
4 : yeah, so
2 : that's no good.
4 : what we can do before, before we draw the cards though, so you can put them down. before we draw the cards yeah, don't draw them yet, cause we can use the sandbag before they get drawn, but not after.
1 : why?
2 : wait, time out, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
3 : so yeah we're -- nothing
1 : oh
2 : wait, can't we just use the heli there's three helicopters. can we use the helicopter for me?
3 : yeah
4 : who's got the third? oh yeah, wow she's got both, ok, ok.
2 : theres
2 : can we
3 : i mean i could use mine.
1 : play it at any time, does not count as an action, discard or treasure .
4 : yeah
2 : it's anytime so that counts as
1 : move one or more pawns on the same tile as any other tile, or lift your team off of fool's landing. we all have to be on fool's landing.
2 : right now as anytime.
4 : yeah, that's what i'm saying, yeah.
4 : yeah, but before we draw those, obviously.
3 : oh
3 : what did we can end the game right now.
4 : yeah, as long as they're all in the same place.
4 : yeah, we could.
1 : why?
4 : cause you can, you can helicop it'll be who's, who's move is it? it's gonna be her move next.
3 : we can all
1 : so i can move, here wait, i can move
2 : uh, we should just
3 : alright
4 : yeah
1 : you with me.
2 : kinda get maybe we should get me to safety.
4 : yeah, we would get you to safety and then
4 : uh we can use a helicopter lift for you and then your move just goes.
2 : i'm concerned about me.
1 : ok,
1 : i'm gonna move you.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : ok, so that's
1 : take that.
3 : yes
2 : so that's one.
1 : i'm gonna move
1 : myself,
1 : nah you,
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah then leave her cause her turn will be next and now we've gotta take the three forbidden island cards
1 : ok, right.
3 : oh right thank you.
1 : ok
4 : let's see if we sunk anything.
1 : oh
3 : cause even if that fly
2 : wait a, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1 : what?
2 : oh, , no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry, sorry.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah, now anything can sink. now it doesn't really matter.
1 : ok
1 : whispering gardens,
3 : oh
4 : that's gone.
2 : oh, see,
3 : wow, ok.
2 : i would've had to swim.
1 : umm, howling garden.
4 : yeah, that's what i was worried about.
3 : bottom
4 : yeah, howling garden.
2 : that's gone.
1 : yeah but what if she did have to swim and she was gone? does that the game's over?
2 : the game's over, i would've lost.
4 : that's why i was gonna say, we should just, we should've what, what we would've had to do is, we would've had to
1 : oh
3 : yeah
2 : or we would've lost.
3 : i've been scared, right there.
4 : sandbag misty marsh.
1 : and misty marsh.
2 : ooo see.
4 : yeah
2 : i would've been out of here.
4 : if we hadn't of sand bagged it, that's why i was like
3 : wow
1 : ok
4 : but yeah, we're good. that was a bad idea to fly.
1 : so
4 : your turn and you end the game once we, once you use the helicopter lift.
1 : your turn.
2 : ok
2 : alright
1 : she has to 
2 : what am i doing? oh
4 : you're just moving.
1 : ok.
2 : my move well i don't have to move anywhere.
3 : you can just turn to watchtower and just leave yourself.
4 : 
1 : that's me though, how yeah.
3 : yeah, that's her, yeah.
4 : oh that's you, oh no!
1 : yeah.
4 : that's what i got confused about.
3 : wait so, if we survive
1 : i'm not with you guys, you're gonna leave me behind. you're gonna helicopter out and leave me, leave me.
4 : ah
4 : i miss yeah i misread that. that was the only part
2 : yeah, that's, that's why we should have moved
1 : i saved everyone but myself, thanks.
3 : let's do this
2 : her
4 : yeah
4 : we'll figure it out,
4 : we'll get there.
3 : how about this
2 : alright
4 : you just have to take two cards and
2 : alright well there's nothing else to do, so uh
4 : hopefully nothing will get flooded in the mean time.
2 : ok well that's not going to do anything for us.
4 : i mean we can try and get the flame if you really want to. here, i mean you're the messenger so you can send the cards but you can't t ah, don't bother.
2 : we don't need the flame.
