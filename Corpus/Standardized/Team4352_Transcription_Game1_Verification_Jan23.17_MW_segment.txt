1 : ah
3 : alright
2 : alright
1 : alright, so i'll start
2 : it's all you
1 : umm
2 : so
1 : alright, so three actions
2 : yeah
1 : i'll move
1 : here
1 : and then shore
1 : these two up.
3 : ok
1 : that's two actions,
1 : and then
2 : and then you can do a third.
1 : yeah
1 : umm
2 : well
1 : i guess i can shore up again
2 : i was gonna say
2 : yeah
3 : yeah, let's
2 : ei either do that or m
2 : hmm
3 : you can either move or shore up, so
2 : yeah, but i was gonna say move or shore up, but if you move, probably move to a flooded one if you decide that.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : alright,
1 : eh, actually, no, i'll shore up.
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : either way it's not
3 : oh yeah
1 : and then two of those, can you pass me those, yeah
2 : so,
2 : yeah
1 : thanks. ah, great, great
2 : killing us already
1 : so this goes up
2 : but you still pick two
1 : uh, you're right.
2 : right
3 : water
2 : yeah
1 : so that's gone, right?
1 : and then
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then,
1 : shuffle those? alright
2 : wait, we have to shuffle these first.
2 : go ahead
1 : do we get to see em, , i don't know
3 : you can, i don't know, it doesn't matter.
1 : alright, i don't know if that really matters.
3 : there's a lot
2 : just, yeah
2 : and then, pick two, yeah
1 : and then, two?
1 : oh,
1 : so that one, oh these two actually.
2 : ok
1 : alright
1 : cool
2 : and then
1 : uh, i think i'm done.
2 : it's my
3 : your turn.
2 : is that right, are we done?
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, i'm done.
2 : oh so 
2 : ok
2 : so
3 : you're the
3 : teal one?
2 : i'm, right there
1 : teal
2 : umm
2 : i don't really need to give a card to anyone, i don't think
3 : hmm i would stay put for now.
2 : yeah, i can just keep it.
2 : umm
2 : i can move,
2 : i guess i'll move here.
1 : yeah
2 : and then i can
2 : shore up.
1 : mmhmm
2 : mm
2 : i don't really need to
3 : as your second one?
2 : should i do another action or
1 : yeah, i mean we could shore up. like i guess shoring up's always a good choice.
3 : can you shore up something else?
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : as a third action.
1 : mm
1 : nice
2 : and then, two treasure cards
3 : oh yeah
1 : right
3 : because we know that like, it's going to sink otherwise.
2 : yeah
1 : right, i don't like how you like put em on top, cause then they're about to go up again, yeah.
3 : you know that it's
2 : and then
1 : uh
2 : i still have to pick two flood cards
1 : ye yeah
3 : mmhmm
2 : umm, phantom rock and gold gate.
2 : t
2 : oh, there's
1 : phantom rock's gone
2 : oh, yeah, ok
1 : and the
1 : gold gate, is that it?
1 : why what's that yellow thing at the bottom?
2 : gold
2 : alright
2 : i don't know,
2 : i don't know what that is
1 : i don't think they ever explained it. yeah, whatever.
3 : ok, it's fine.
2 : i don't think it matters,
1 : we good, we good
2 : they're just pawn pieces.
3 : bye
1 : but like the edges are kinda not really important,
1 : so i think we'll be alright.
2 : just for the treasures
3 : uh, my turn?
1 : yeah
2 : yes
3 : umm
3 : i don't really need to do anything
1 : you're blue right?
3 : yeah
1 : umm
2 : you could fly
2 : wait, can't you can fly anywhere.
3 : i can go right wherever i want.
2 : do you wanna fly to lost lagoon and shore it up?
3 : sure
1 : mm
3 : why not
2 : cause flying doesn't count as an action, right, for you?
3 : umm
1 : probably does, i don't know.
3 : no it
2 : does it?
3 : does, yeah.
2 : ok
2 : and then you can
1 : shore that up.
3 : i can shore up adjacent ones, or?
1 : yeah, you can shore up adjacent
2 : yeah
2 : or the ones that you're on
1 : yeah
3 : ok, that's fine.
1 : that's two actions
1 : and then, i don't know i mean, there's not that much to do.
2 : yeah
3 : umm
1 : i don't know
3 : so  probably gonna go is
3 : this one and
3 : that one, right?
2 : uh
3 : that's ok
1 : yeah
2 : well, if you, yeah, if you pick a flood card, then yeah
3 : right,
3 : ok
3 : umm,
1 : alright, we're good
2 : so,
3 : do i need to do a third, or
2 : you don't have to if you don't want to.
1 : yeah, i mean you could fly so it's not a big deal.
3 : oh
3 : umm, so then i pick two of these
3 : and
3 : what are all these helicopter lifts
1 : nice
3 : alright
3 : well these are my four.
2 : yeah
1 : oh, i forgot about the five cards.
1 : alright
2 : yeah i have four you only have three, so
1 : mmhmm
3 : and i need to
3 : i guess shuffle and like the
2 : well, do wait do you have to do it every i think it's just with the water rise cards that you have to shuffle.
3 : same
1 : yeah, so i think you just pick two.
2 : yeah
3 : oh
3 : oh
1 : whatcha get?
3 : lost lagoon,
1 : that's this, oh that was a good flip.
3 : and cliffs of abandon, oh so this one.
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : alright
2 : that was a good move.
1 : yeah, good work.
2 : flipping that shoring that up.
3 : and then that's it
3 : discard that.
1 : alright
2 : ok
1 : so it's my turn?
3 : mmhmm
1 : hmm
1 : here i'll try to shore those two up, i guess. shore one,
1 : one move here, that's two actions, and then shore this.
3 : well did you need to move?
1 : uh yeah, cause i can't do it diagonal.
2 : yeah, cause it wasn't adjacent.
3 : you can't do diagonal, ok.
1 : mm
1 : so that's three moves and then
1 : draw
1 : can you pass me two treasure cards please?
1 : thank you
1 : thanks.
3 : that's your third move?
1 : uh,
1 : nah that was like
3 : or you have one more
1 : a required action i think.
1 : yeah 
2 : i think you have to pick treasure cards.
1 : yeah
3 : oh, as in you're done with your three moves, right? ok. uh
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : and then two of these
1 : whispering garden,
2 : mm
1 : oh here it is.
1 : and
1 : iron gate.
2 : that's right here.
1 : yep.
1 : oh that kinda sucks.
2 : ok
1 : uh, then, i think i'm done.
3 : mmhmm
2 : umm
1 : alright, so there's no to like bring these down, right?
1 : 
2 : hmm
3 : i don't think so.
2 : no, cause you'll lose if you get to five, so
1 : so we're kinda
3 : you can't unsink an island.
1 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : yo, they can rig it so we go up to here automatically and then we're done.
2 : i don't know if there's really anything i need to
2 : do.
3 : umm
1 : uh
1 : i mean we
2 : cause i'm not near any cards that are
1 : right. maybe we can like
1 : stack up on these and
1 : or
1 : i don't know, get em sorted out, but doesn't really matter.
3 : i keep thinking that we can move diagonally. only he can do that.
1 : yeah, but since he ain't here
3 : ok, he's not there. ok
2 : but he's not here, so no one can move diagonally
2 : yeah, cause i'm thinking, she's
3 : umm
2 : would probably have to move onto yours,
1 : yeah, well i got three of these, yeah, so we should try to cash that in.
2 : and then give you that card, yeah.
2 : that's what i said, just give you that card.
1 : mmhmm
1 : umm
1 : doesn't really matter or, i have five, i guess, so i gotta get rid of one later.
2 : but
2 : yeah, so
1 : alright
2 : but there's really nothing
1 : which co you're this one?
2 : should i move, yeah, should i move somewhere?
1 : uh, you can do one, two, and then action, flip, three, if you want.
3 : might as well.
2 : ok
1 : doesn't really matter.
2 : one, two, and then someon's gonna flip that.
1 : cool.
2 : alright, and that's my turn and then i have to pick two of these, hopefully it's not oh, of course it is!
2 : perfect, alright.
1 : great
2 : so that's my five cards
2 : and then i have to shuffle these.
1 : and then move this one up, yeah.
3 : and then
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, just one
3 : and then you have to get three
1 : oh yeah
2 : and then i have to pick three
2 : of the ones i just shuffled.
2 : iron gate,
2 : temple of the moon,
1 : iron gate's gone
2 : it's right there.
1 : temple where is temple of the moon?
2 : right there, and breaker's bridge,
2 : which is right here.
1 : oh
1 : shoot.
2 : ok
3 : ok my turn
2 : now we have to strategize you because
1 : so you should give me the green
2 : you have to
2 : well, she has to move on your tile first.
3 : i can't give you anything.
1 : oh right
2 : well if you're on the tile you can.
3 : well he has five cards.
1 : well, i can dis i think i can discard once i get it, i believe.
2 : well he can discard
2 : cause it says if you have more
2 : than five, if you give him a card he has to immediately get rid of a card.
1 : 
3 : but like why would you wanna get rid of like one of these cards, cause they're the ones that you're trying to get
1 : 
1 : 
3 : you're stocking up on.
3 : you know what i mean? like one, two, three, we wanna get to one person.
2 : ye
2 : right
1 : or i can discard this, cause we only have two so far.
2 : yeah
3 : that's true.
1 : yeah.
2 : cause there's like a lot of these in here, so, it'll probably pop up again
3 : ok
1 : mmhmm
3 : oh where am i? i'm the blue one.
1 : yeah, so you want me to just like, move me, move you onto this?
3 : yeah
1 : alright
1 : so that's one
2 : so that would be one,
3 : one
2 : and then two would be giving that to him,
1 : and then i'll
1 : yeah, i'll take that. and then i'll discard
1 : uh, this one, alright
2 : the red one, because we have three purples on the board,
3 : the fire
1 : got it
2 : so,
1 : so that's
1 : three, or that was two moves, right? move past
2 : that was two
1 : you got
2 : and then
3 : and then i'll unflood something
2 : yeah and then you can shore
1 : yeah that sounds like a good idea.
2 : well, you should probably
2 : no
1 : yeah, no, go for it, go for it
2 : yeah, that, yeah that one's fine.
3 : right
3 : oh
2 : cause if that sinks, you guys can just swim
3 : we can go wherever we want
1 : right
2 : yeah
3 : and then two of these
1 : yup
3 : and sandbag.
2 : and then three flood cards.
1 : three kinda sucks
2 : sorry guys oh, that was four
3 : whispering garden,
1 : alright
3 : cliffs of abandon, there's some right here oh is that gone?
1 : cliffs
1 : i think it's this oh did we
3 : oh i don't know
1 : like get rid of the card there? alright
2 : yeah, i was giving them to her.
3 : yeah
1 : cool
3 : and lost lagoon.
1 : umm, here we go
2 : alright, now
1 : so i should probably cash that in, and that's probably one, two
2 : eh
2 : i was gonna say, yeah you have to get to a tile
1 : hmm
1 : but then i can't like
1 : uh
1 : what's it called, shore up
3 : un
3 : yeah
1 : or whatever.
2 : well,
2 : i can shore up
1 : right, but i'm afraid or actually, cause i'm not gonna draw these right once they're in there, yeah so i guess i'll go for
2 : unless you draw a water rise card then you're
2 :  do that
1 : yeah, ok
1 : umm
1 : well i mean, these don't really matter i guess, so i'll go ahead
3 : well why don't you shore up
3 : and
1 : uh, well, cause i would have to move
2 : wait, does claiming a treasure count as a move?
1 : i thought so, yeah, capture a treasure
1 : is an action, yeah.
2 : oh, ok
2 : well,
2 : if you
2 : hmm
3 : because
1 : where's the other one? there's one and that's the other, yeah
2 : well if you just do the treasure,
1 : mmhmm
2 : i can shore up both of these
3 : well why don't you shore up two cards, and then your second move will be here, and your third move will be oh well you have to cash it in.
2 : but then you can't cash it in.
1 : yeah
1 : we'll just cash it in anyways.
2 : well, i was gonna say, you can cash it in on your next turn.
1 : yeah
1 : uh
2 : like just move on the tile
1 : mm
3 : but, like, what if he gets like, on this turn he gets more like, then he can't keep them, cause he has already so many.
1 : i feel like the faster we cash in the better.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, we'll go for it.
1 : right
2 : let's do it.
1 : one, two,
1 : cash this in, so discard i think?
2 : ye
3 : ss discard it.
1 : yeah, let's just discard it, that would make sense.
2 : yeah
1 : and take this, or should i just like put it on to the side?
3 : and that, just keep that, yeah
2 : yeah, just keep it
2 : keep it by your, yeah
3 : yeah
1 : cool
1 : uh, so that's one, two, three actions
2 : and then
2 : so that was three
2 : and then two
1 : yeah two of those
2 : treasure cards.
3 : 
2 : just don't get a rise up card, ok, yay.
1 : ah don't ay, let's go!
1 : and then, three
1 : temple,
3 : of the sun
1 : temple of the sun,
3 : right here
1 : uh, crimson forest,
2 : up there.
1 : copper gate.
3 : ok
2 : alright
3 : so nothing sank.
2 : that's good.
1 : that's it.
2 : ok,
2 : so,
3 : your turn.
1 : you're t you're like the gray one, right?
2 : uh
2 : yeah
3 : i think the next turn i might give you one of these.
1 : yeah and then
1 : uh
2 : yeah, cause i have two of these.
3 : yeah
1 : wait, you're the messenger, right?
2 : yeah, i can give away any of my cards at any time but i mean that doesn't help when i have two.
1 : ok
1 : alright
1 : but, yeah, you got two already, and you're close to this,
1 : so
2 : well, i could
2 : i don't know
2 : i was trying to find the most efficient way to get on the same
2 : square
2 : as one of you guys,
2 : but we also need to shore up
1 : mm
2 : all these tiles.
3 : yeah, i think this one, we should definitely i think
3 : shore up.
2 : yeah
2 : go ahead shh
1 : uh
3 : do you want to?
2 : cause we nee that has a thingy on it, like an icon, so we can't lose that card.
2 : or we can't lose that tile.
3 : mmhmm
3 : then again we still have that too, but
2 : yeah
1 : yeah we could go for this one, like if you give me two of those i would have a three
1 : and then
2 : i think i can only give you one per
1 : oh
1 : umm
2 : can i only give him one?
1 : maybe
1 : if it's an separate action
2 : i think i oh wait,
3 : one per action. if she wants to do two actions then she could give you both.
2 : one per action.
1 : mmhmm
1 : we could do that.
2 : ok
3 : but in that case
3 : i might as well give it to her and you would give it to her.
1 : and then
1 : right oh yeah, we could do that as well. so we'd have to flip that.
2 : so, shore up that one as my first one, yeah
3 : a one
1 : action one
2 : and then
1 : uh
2 : should i shore up another card?
1 : uh
2 : cause someone's gonna pick a rise card soon
2 : and then it might
2 : screw us over.
1 : yeah we might wanna kee try to keep this one cause it'll be easier to like
3 : it's pretty central for moving.
2 : yeah,
3 : you wanna shore this one up?
1 : yeah
2 : yeah, go ahead, shore that one up
2 : and then
1 : that's two and then
2 : i could
2 : mm
2 : i can either shore up another one or i can move
2 : to the actual like
2 : this space.
1 : yeah
1 : i mean, it's your call, it doesn't really matter i don't think.
2 : mm
2 : i don't know.
1 : maybe we can shh
2 : should i shore up?
3 : on the next,
3 : well on the next yeah i think you should shore up, cause on the next one when it comes back to you your first action can be that.
2 : yeah.
2 : yeah, go ahead and shore up the that one.
1 : if for like one of your actions, you can't like take a card, right, you can only give it to someone, i assume?
2 : yeah, i can only give them.
3 : she can't take a card.
2 : so like, you guys, if you guys give me a card, you still have to be on the same tile as me.
1 : yeah, i can give a single card.
1 : mmhmm, ok.
2 : so, you guys are gonna have to work your way up
3 : ok
1 : oh, i forgot about that.
2 : yeah
3 : so do you want these now?
1 : oh, that's gonna be rough.
2 : yeah
3 : there's a rise up
2 : eh i told you it was gonna come up!
1 : ah great
2 : alright
2 : one, two, three, four.
2 : ok, well should i just discard this one, cause we already
3 : yeah
1 : two, four
2 : wait,
3 : we don't need that.
2 : yeah,
2 : and then i have to use the water rise
1 : yeah
2 : so that has to go up one
3 : oh.
1 : great
2 : yay
2 : and then i have to shuffle these
1 : so that means like the ones that showed up
1 : is more likely than oh that sucks.
3 : yeah
1 : hmm
2 : oh 
2 : temple of the sun,
3 : boom
1 : oh that's gone.
2 : oh it's gone.
2 : uh, crimson
2 : forest
2 : is
1 : that's alright it's not,
2 : ah
2 : that's also gone
1 : yeah it's not a big deal.
2 : that's cool, umm
2 : temple of the moon.
1 : alright, we should probably keep that one.
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : alright, that's not bad
2 : and
3 : that's it right?
2 : if i go for that one
2 : well
2 : aw, never mind.
3 : ok
3 : my turn.
2 : yeah
3 : umm
3 : i'm on, i'm blue right?
1 : it might be faster to give me the cards cause
3 : she doesn't have that many.
1 : nah cause it would take us so long to get there to give her the card, you know what i mean?
3 : well
3 : what do you mean?
1 : but you're only two tiles away so you could give me the card and then
3 : for which one, for which one?
1 : uh
1 : this one, the lion.
3 : well,
3 : she's just the next one, right? she just needs the
1 : right
2 : no, he's saying, but i
1 : but we have to get there, you know what i mean?
1 : that's a lot of time.
2 : yeah, you guys have to make your way up to me.
2 : but like, if he is down here
3 : oh, got it.
2 : and you move
2 : two,
2 : and then he moves
2 : like three down here,
3 : and then you would use your two actions
2 : i can give him yeah i can use two actions to give him
1 : mmhmm, so we could do it in like the next turn.
2 : two cards.
3 : ok
3 : or, ok, so should
3 : my first action be this?
1 : or you'd have to move onto my square, like
3 : alright
2 : so you have to use two actions
1 : one, two, and then three.
3 : two
2 : the only thing is about shoring up
3 : is that worth it?
1 : yeah
2 : that's our only
1 : right, right
1 : well
2 : i mean, we can wait a turn to do the card switch
1 : alright, so like, we can shore this up, yeah, yeah.
3 : how about if i do one, and then i can give you this maybe?
1 : uh
3 : since i'm there.
1 : yeah
3 : cause we have three of those.
1 : uh do we have
1 : yeah or we have three, i guess we need one more.
1 : i mean we could go for it
3 : since i'm there, like i can
1 : i'm down
1 : yeah, yeah, alright, yeah, go for it.
3 : ok
3 : so i'll do
1 : or
3 : one
2 : wait
3 : or no
1 : uh
2 : you have to be to give him a card, you have to be on the same tile as him.
1 : right
2 : so you still have to move, you
3 : oh on the same tile, not the same icon.
2 : yeah, no, so you still have to use two moves to give him any cards.
2 : so i mean if you want to, we can
2 : shore up this turn,
3 : so eh
3 : i'll shore this up, go here, and then give him this one?
1 : eh no
2 : no, cause that's four
2 : or you can just sho
1 : we should decide if we're going for this or that.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah it doesn't it's up to you guys, i don't really
1 : have any
2 : well we could
3 : well we have three of these on,
3 : on table.
1 : right.
2 : yeah, these we don't really have to worry about, cause we can do this at anytime.
3 : and
3 : well the thing is we need a
1 : we only need three uh treasures too
3 : fourth
2 : yeah, we also only need three treasures to
1 : yeah
3 : but there's only two of these on
1 : right
3 : the table, so i feel like
1 : i wonder where it is in the deck.
3 : cause once this is gone, then like all three of these cards are like
1 : worthless, right, yeah, no i see what you're saying.
3 : worthless.
1 : doesn't matter.
1 : i'm cool with either one
2 : we should also shore up
1 : yeah, you could do like all three shores if you want, like shore or i guess i could i should probably do it cause i'm more
2 : two
2 : do
2 : well
2 : if you,
2 : if she shores up all three of these,
2 : and then
2 : you
1 : move to her spot and then give her the card, yeah that sounds good, let's do that.
2 : move to her
2 : and then, yeah, and then give her the card, cause either of you can get the cards, it doesn't matter.
1 : sounds good.
3 : ok
2 : so, why don't you shore up
2 : and then he can come to you?
1 : got it.
2 : and i can give you cards, cause i can give cards whenever.
1 : good idea.
3 : ok
2 : so we'll just switch it and you'll just go get the treasure.
3 : alright, so is it ok if he gives me the card and like i have to get rid of like a bunch of stuff?
2 : umm
1 : yeah i mean,
1 : yeah,
1 : or we could use it you know?
2 : well, you only uh
3 : you know what i'm saying?
1 : using's not a bad idea
2 : yeah, you can use a sandbag
1 : mmhmm
2 : wait, does, using a sandbag does not count as a turn, right?
1 : right
1 : uh
2 : so you can use a sandbag now if you want,
2 : since on the next turn
1 : or
1 : nah let's do it at three
3 : it doesn't count as
1 : oh but you have to do it on your turn.
3 : it doesn't count as an action and i can play it at anytime, i don't have to do it on my turn.
2 : yeah, it doesn't count.
1 : umm
3 : so if that's a scenario than i can use it then.
2 : well he would be next
2 : so you would have to use it now.
3 : how about i do one, two, i shore up
1 : mmhmm
3 : and then i just move here
3 : so you have to only move once,
1 : it doesn't matter.
2 : so shore up those two, and then
3 : instead of twice.
3 : and then i'll move over, so like meeting halfway.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, i'm cool
2 : as long as this one gets shored up.
2 : cause we need that, that one can't sink, yeah.
3 : wanna do that?
1 : yeah, i'm fine with that.
3 : ok
3 : one,
3 : two,
3 : and then i'll move here.
1 : cool
3 : and then i pick two of these
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok, i needa use these helicopter lifts
3 : 
1 : i wonder if you'll oh you have si two, four, si
3 : ok, let's
2 : why don't you,
2 : you can move anyone on a helicopter lift,
1 : yeah
3 : yeah.
2 : why don't you move me
2 : down to you guys, that way we're all kind of in a central location.
1 : yeah that's a good idea.
2 : that way if you need to get to me
2 : or i need to get to you
3 : shh ok, umm
2 : you know what i mean?
3 : how about, shh do you want to come onto my card?
2 : yeah, that's fine.
3 : wanna do that?
2 : ah
1 : ah no, have her come to ours,
1 : or one of us, i don't know.
2 : why don't
2 : oh wait
2 : who are we giving these two?
1 : you,
1 : probably.
2 : we're giving
2 : these to me?
1 : yeah
2 : because if you fly me
2 : down here,
2 : or if you fly me right here
1 : yeah, we could do that.
3 : we need well, yeah, you need to be here so he can give that to you.
2 : right
1 : yeah, fly her here.
2 : so fly me here.
3 : well, umm, this is your turn right?
1 : are we allowed to do that?
1 : er
2 : yeah
1 : cause we have six
1 : so we kinda have to like
1 : discard and then, i don't know, i don't know.
3 : umm, wait so it's your turn right now?
1 : nah, it, it, will be mine.
2 : no, it's still your it's technically still your turn.
3 : whose it's my turn right now, oh right, ok.
1 : yeah
3 : i just got really confused
3 : umm
2 : so, put me here,
2 : get rid of this card,
3 : so i did the helicopter lift
2 : and then you can do a sandbag
3 : can i just sandbag
2 : just on the lost lagoon.
1 : we can, yeah
1 : yeah, i guess we could do that.
2 : cause i still have a sandbag too if we need it.
1 : sweet
3 : ok
3 : so
1 : alright
1 : and then
1 : three,
3 : yeah.
1 : yeah
1 : i don't know if you want any of them
3 : one more
1 : which ones?
3 : whispering garden,
1 : we can like just
2 : lost lagoon
3 : lost lagoon
1 : get rid of that, it doesn't really matter.
3 : breaker's
1 : breaker's this?
3 : yeah, that one.
1 : breaker's bridge.
3 : ok
2 : now, it's your turn.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so i need a card
1 : i'll give you this, that's one.
2 : and then i have to discard
1 : uh
3 : or use
1 : probably discard the fire, yeah.
1 : cause we have
1 : four of these on, on
2 : yeah, i'm gonna dis i'm just gonna discard the fire.
1 : alright
3 : ok
1 : that's,
1 : that was one move.
1 : uh, so you, so i gave you that, so i can
1 : go here and
1 : flip that
2 : we
1 : or here
2 : yeah, i was gonna say, go right there,
2 : oh wait yeah, or up there, it doesn't matter.
1 : yeah, it doesn't really matter.
1 : yeah
2 : actually, yeah, go up, because we were eventually wanna get to there.
1 : yeah.
1 : mmhmm
1 : now that was three, that's three moves. card, move, flip, yup.
2 : right
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : can you pass me two of those?
2 : don't get a rise card. yes! you didn't get a rise card.
1 : oh wow, two fires, great, whatever.
2 : oh, well, that's ok.
1 : and then three
1 : of these.
1 : umm
1 : tidal palace,
1 : yeah
1 : we don't need that one.
1 : copper gate,
2 : it's up there
1 : cliffs of abandon
2 : alright
1 : uh, yeah, yeah that's it
2 : ok
1 : your turn
2 : i should probably use
2 : a sandbag
1 : mmhmm, yeah, i agree.
2 : on the cliffs of abandon,
1 : uh, yeah, yeah
2 : because we need that.
2 : so i'm just but that
3 : why do we need that?
1 : cause it's like central, it's like
2 : because if it sinks, it's like a central like
1 : yeah we wanna keep like the middle alright
3 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : so that's, that's, that's not an action, alright.
2 : but that doesn't count, that doesn't count as an action.
1 : umm
2 : umm
1 : so which one are you? the gray
2 : yeah
3 : so i think
3 : i should at one point get all of these.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
3 : right?
3 : but i need to get rid of cards first so
2 : well do you wanna use
2 : wait, where do i need to be?
3 : i can use a helicopter card right now,
3 : but i don't
1 : you can just chill out
2 : well do you wanna
3 : i
1 : yeah
2 : do you wanna use a helicopter card and
2 : put me here?
3 : so you can
2 : that way i don't have to
2 : move anywhere, and that's one less action
3 : on the next turn?
3 : yeah, i can do that.
3 : so, how many actions have you done so far?
1 : zero
2 : acutally wait,
2 : use that on yourself
2 : because i still need this card from you
2 : and that'll take away one less action,
2 : cause you have to move on my tile.
3 : alright
2 : so yeah, use that and put yours
1 : right
1 : the pilot can fly anywhere, anyways, right?
2 : oh yeah
1 : isn't that one of the things
3 : yeah,
3 : i can go anywhere, yeah.
1 : right
2 : yeah
1 : umm, i mean, there's not
2 : uh
1 : there's not that much to do.
3 : so it's never a really useful for me to use a helicopter lift on myself
2 : no
1 : uh, well it takes away an action i guess but i mean
1 : besides that, yeah.
1 : umm
2 : yeah if you don't wanna use an action to get somewhere
1 : yeah,
1 : but there's i don't think there's much you can do.
1 : or i guess you can give her the card now, right, two, four, five, yeah
3 : basically, i want to use one
2 : well she
2 : yeah, so we don't waste it.
3 : if i,
3 : yeah.
3 : cause i don't wanna get rid of this, this, or this.
1 : you can get rid of the helicopter, i mean it's not a big deal
3 : so
1 : didn't yeah
2 : so yeah, do the helicopter and just put me there
1 : wait, but i think uh do you have to be on your turn to use that?
2 : no
3 : no, it says play at any time.
1 : no?
1 : ah sweet, yeah then use that
2 : so then that's
2 : me here
1 : and then
2 : and then
3 : you still haven't done any actions yet.
1 : yeah, and you should give her the,
1 : the egg.
2 : yeah, and then i'm gonna
2 : give you that
2 : and that counts as one of my actions
1 : mmhmm, i mean that's all that you can do.
2 : and i don't really need to do anymore actions,
1 : yeah, you're fine.
2 : cause you guys
1 : yeah, we good, we good.
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, because you have to give me a card, but you can fly anywhere,
3 : yeah
2 : so you can just fly down to me and give me the card, ok.
3 : ok
1 : yeah so let's try to get this after that.
2 : yeah
1 : that's that'd be three.
2 : ok
2 : actually
1 : oh wow you would get
3 : well then
1 : that
1 : sweet
1 : umm
2 : wait i can't go back and do actions after i no ok, so i'll just wait on the next turn.
1 : nah
3 : ok
1 : eh
2 : so then you guys can just automatically start going for that then.
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : alright, so it's my turn
2 : well i have to pick three
1 : yeah
1 : three
3 : oh you need three of those.
2 : one, two, three.
2 : caves of shadows, which is this one,
1 : we don't need
1 : that.
2 : umm, dunes of deception, right here,
2 : and silver gate,
1 : there's a copper gate and a silver gate?
2 : up there.
1 : got it
2 : yeah
2 : and an iron gate, isn't ther an iron there was an iron gate.
3 : and a gold one
1 : oh there's a bronze gate, i like the
2 : there's like a million gates
1 : ah, the gates have like the person i don't, i don't know what the gates are.
2 : ok
1 : uh
2 : so i'm now i'm done. now, it's your turn. don't pick a water rise card.
2 : whatever you do
1 : umm
3 : umm, i legit don't even need this
2 : well, you could just
3 : so, umm
2 : so now
2 : tr
2 : oh crap
2 : umm
2 : wait
3 : we need to be on
1 : i think you move,
2 : you should shore up
1 : i think, yeah, your move
3 : yeah, can we shore this one up?
2 : because you still have to give her your card, and you guys are still on the same tile, so i wouldn't move anywhere if i was you.
3 : yeah, we need to stay on the same tile.
3 : yeah
2 : i would just shore up
3 : yeah
1 : yeah, go ahead.
1 : that's one
2 : and just have that as your only action.
1 : yeah
1 : and then,
1 : and then probably move here so you're closer to this.
2 : well you two need to be on the same
3 : we need to be on the same card for this
1 : well i can move there and then give you the card, yeah.
2 : oh that's true.
2 : cause yeah, cause you can move here and you can shore up
1 : yeah
3 : alright, for me to like
2 : yeah, so just
3 : that's me
1 : i think you're blue, or yeah, yeah, alright, cool.
3 : yeah
2 : so then you
3 : that was two?
1 : that was two
2 : yeah
2 : i mean, you don't have to take three you could shore up if you wanted.
1 : i mean i guess you,
1 : you can shore up.
3 : why not?
3 : mm
3 : it doesn't matter
3 : or which ones are
1 : alright, yeah, that's cool.
1 : it
3 : are both of those new?
2 : yeah, they're both in there.
1 : yeah, it doesn't really matter.
1 : that's three
1 : so, two of that
2 : uh
3 : do we need any of them?
1 : you can get rid of em both.
3 : right?
3 : well we're definitely getting i can definitely get rid of this one.
1 : oh, yeah, yeah.
2 : yeah, you can get rid of that and then
3 : i
2 : took the fire one.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah.
1 : alright
1 : and then three.
1 : what happens if you run out of these?
2 : i have no idea.
3 : you should probably just shuffle those.
1 : umm
2 : we should probably look that up.
1 : howling garden, uh
3 : that's whispering.
1 : oh, that one,
1 : this one's turned.
1 : uh
3 : cave of embers
1 : cave of embers, yeah.
3 : this one.
1 : and then bronze
1 : so this one.
1 : alright, then your turn's over.
2 : and then it's your turn now.
1 : uhuh
2 : so you have to move to her.
1 : umm
1 : right
2 : and then you have to give her a card.
1 : one,
3 : should i get rid of
1 : two,
2 : just get rid of the fire,
1 : yeah
2 : cause you need the helicopter to get off the island.
1 : that's two
2 : and then she can shore up
1 : uh
2 : for your third one if you wanted to.
1 : yeah, yeah, we definitely should.
1 : three.
3 : ok
1 : can you pass me two?
2 : ah, i knew that was gonna happen.
1 : alright
1 : the helicopter and and this water rise, yeah.
2 : you have to use that one,
2 : which we're still at three, so, you could just move that up one.
1 : oh alright, i guess it's not a
2 : and then shuffle all those, aw
1 : yeah so we gotta make sure this doesn't come up.
2 : i'm gonna need you to shuffle those really well
1 : it's like all after the shh uh oh, cause i'm drawing three afterwards right?
2 : yeah
2 : this is rough guys
1 : let's go
2 : wait, can i oh, never mind.
1 : i can't really, ah there's no sandbags.
2 : where did the
3 : just,
1 : eh
2 : yeah, i used my sandbag. it's ok.
3 : just take three
1 : alright
1 : if we draw these two, we're kind of screwed.
1 : one,
1 : two,
1 : uh three, alright, that's not bad, that's 
2 : ok
1 : whispering garden's out,
2 : that's fine as long as this one didn't go.
1 : yeah
3 : breaker's bridge, i just turned over.
1 : alright, and then the dunes.
1 : alright, my turn's over.
2 : ok
1 : alright, so you have
2 : uh,
1 : four right?
2 : so i'm gonna
2 : do this as one of my moves,
1 : mmhmm, definitely.
2 : so that's that.
2 : these can all go in discard
1 : yeah, you don't really have to shore up on that, cause it's
3 : yeah, i don't think it needs to be shored up to do that
2 : no, and then i'm gonna use my s oh wait, you already have four of those.
1 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : that was only one right?
1 : yeah i guess we can ma start moving towards the fool's landing.
2 : well, i can just move up one
1 : uh huh
2 : and then i can just shh shore up ,
2 : i can shore up this one.
2 : because if you guys sink,
2 : for some reason, you need to go somewhere.
1 : yeah
1 : alright, yeah good idea. that's three.
2 : ok,
2 : that was three.
2 : so now
1 : so
2 : i'm done,
1 : two treasures
2 : which is kind of useless but that's ok.

2 : so if it's your turn you have to move there first
3 : i need to move
2 : as one.
1 : yeah, and then collect it
3 : one
3 : oops, sorry.
2 : and then that's oh sorry. that's two.
1 : so that's two moves
2 : and then shore up
1 : uh, or actually you don't nah, don't shore up.
2 : are you sure?
1 : yeah
1 : cause if it floods, it'll be like a free move to here for me.
2 : oh that's true.
1 : we have three treasures right? yeah, just fly to yeah
2 : uh, you could fly, yeah fly yourself to fool's landing.
3 : sorry.
3 : uh
3 : that's three.
1 : yeah, that's three, right, yeah.
2 : how much time do we have left?

2 : ok
1 : uh oh
3 : and i need three of those.
2 : so, yeah
2 : one, two, three.
1 : yeah, so we just have to rush towards fool's landing.
2 : which we can both make it in one move in one turn.
3 : uh
1 : mmhmm
3 : gone.
1 : make sure they don't flood.
2 : that's fine.
3 : silver gate,
2 : mm it's up there.
1 : that's gone
2 : and the lost lagoon's back here.
1 : oh yeah

1 : one,
1 : two,
2 : and then
1 : umm
2 : you don't,
2 : you don't have to take a third action if you don't want to.
1 : alright
2 : you get two of those and then pick three of these.
1 : oh, i have to discard two, four, five,
1 : six.
3 : get rid of those

3 : ok, say that was one, two, three, four
1 : alright, wait, let's just look up winning.
1 : umm winning the game
2 : oh wait, winning the game
3 : maybe you need to finish your turn.
2 : that's what i was wondering, if i needed to finish my turn or not.
3 : yeah
3 : i think
1 : i mean there's no way we can like lose
2 : yeah, that's true, i can just i'll finish my turn and then you can just use it.
1 : alright, yeah.
2 : uh, except for when you get a water rise card. that's ok.
2 : and i have to pick four.
2 : i guess i can
1 : it seems like you can win like now, but i don't know, what you're yeah.
2 : can i win oh, it doesn't really matter.
2 : so, let's see. dunes of deception,
1 : mmhmm
2 : breaker's bridge is gone,
