1 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : umm
1 : since i have two of the
1 : uh
1 : fire cards
1 : i'll
1 : probably try and
1 : yeah, move yeah, get, get over there, so i'll move there
2 : the closest one is here.
1 : and then
2 : you could shore up another two cards.
1 : uh
2 : or can you only do that once per turn?
1 : umm that's a good question
2 : well it did say does it give a condition?
3 : shore up two
1 : two tiles, oh for one action, so yeah, so i think i can, yeah
2 : as one action
3 : tiles for one action.
2 : yeah so shore those
3 : yeah

3 : there you go.
1 : alright
1 : and then
3 : alright
1 : i
1 : draw
1 : two treasure deck cards.
1 : k so we got
1 : the chalice and a water's rise card,
1 : so that means it moves up
1 : t two and then
1 : draw two,
1 : or wait
2 : yup,
2 : draw the according to the water level which is now
1 : what're, what're, what are these?
2 : two.
2 : they these were the ones that started flipped over.
1 : should
1 : oh ok, yeah, yeah, yeah, so i
1 : do that, so we got
2 : oh shuffle,
1 : oh yeah
2 : shuffle then.
1 : ok so
1 : two cards.
1 : so phantom rock and
1 : gold gate
2 : so can you sink that?
2 : mm
3 : phantom rock, uh sink it.
2 : yeah

3 : ok
1 : and then gold gate, so we also remove gold gate.
3 : 
2 : sink this
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : so

1 : i
1 : put this card in the
3 : 
1 : treasure
1 : discard pile.
1 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : ok.
2 : three actions, umm
1 : maybe
1 : so you're on fool's landing
2 : oh
2 : really?
3 : wait i think i'm
2 : the gray, no
1 : oh, wait, yeah different color, yeah, you're on fool's landing.
3 : i think i'm on fool's landing, yeah.
2 : silver gate.
2 : so
2 : i am near this and i have a card so i'm going to move
2 : one,
2 : oh
2 : also i have a this card.
2 : i'm gonna give this to you
2 : as one of my moves.
1 : ok yeah
2 : it's two moves actions and i'm going to uh
2 : move here
2 : for my third action
1 : ok
2 : and now i'm drawing two treasure cards.
2 : sandbags
2 : and the second one of these.
2 : umm shore up
2 : any one
2 : on the island and nothing's turned over.
1 : nnhmm
2 : so
2 : yeah
2 : umm
1 : ok
2 : and draw the flood cards.
2 : umm, breaker's bridge
1 : mmhmm that's there
2 : and the whispering garden.
2 : it's your turn.
3 : ok.
3 : alright so uh take up to three actions, umm
3 : i can
3 : umm
2 : you might wanna save that cause we need one to get off the island.
3 : yeah, yeah, you're right.
1 : and yeah, just for the end of the game and everything.
3 : so i'm
3 : close
3 : let's see, i've got one of these little cards right here.
3 : umm
2 : and you're two away from it.
3 : yeah
3 : let's see.
3 : alright
3 : i can't move yeah
2 : or actually since you can fly anywhere
2 : or is that that's your normal skill.
3 : yeah i can fly
1 : yeah, so he doesn't even have to use the helicopter lift.
2 : so maybe
2 : you should move close to
2 : you should move
2 : here
2 : so you can flip
2 : this one
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then move over one and flip that
2 : too.
3 : so move here
3 : and flip it
3 : and move here
3 : and flip that.
2 : yup.
3 : ok,
3 : alright.
2 : that's three,
3 : three actions
2 : move, flip
2 : ah
3 : uh ok so i say, i say umm what what two moves uh that's right, that's two moves and i can only flip one
2 : oh
2 : ok.
3 : alright
3 : uh
3 : whoops, ok.
3 : alright, so i've already done three actions so i also need to take two treasure deck cards.
3 : uh
3 : two 
3 : treasure deck cards
3 : and
3 : these are the treasure deck cards and i need to take uh
3 : flood cards equal to the water level, that's
3 : two right?
1 : n
2 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : so, we got one and two
1 : oh wait, we, we have to reshuffle these first
2 : yeah
2 : oh
3 : oh, that's right, that's right, that's right, yeah
1 : yeah
3 : uh and put them on the top or uh
1 : so
1 : wait
1 : or
2 : yeah
2 : oh, only water's rising
3 : uh yeah, oh yeah
1 : oh, only when there's a water's rising, or yeah
3 : uh, uh, uh yeah so we got uh
3 : lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon
1 : ok, so lost lagoon
3 : and cliffs of abandon
3 : uh
1 : they're right here.
3 : right there ok
2 : ok
3 : alright
3 : uh
2 : now it's your turn
1 : ok so, now it's my turn, umm
1 : i'll use
1 : one action to
2 : will it be smartest to flip
1 : probably
1 : these, these two, yeah
2 : yeah
1 : then umm
2 : 
1 : mm
1 : i think move to where
1 : the
1 : uh chalice is or where the fire crystal is. so yeah, the chalice is closer so yeah, i guess move.
2 : oh
2 : chalice is right there.
3 : chalice is 
3 : 
1 : one over and then uh i have one more move
1 : so i'll
1 : mm
1 : can, can, can i move
1 : twice?
2 : yeah
3 : you've already done two
1 : yeah, so one more move, like, one more move
2 : mmhmm
3 : actions
2 : yeah, would make sense
1 : to be my third action
2 : to move right here cause even if you got another card you could move right there.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok
1 : then two treasure deck cards. i'm gonna wait, i have to discard
2 : after you pull you can choose what you discard.
1 : yeah
1 : ok, so i'm gonna
1 : discard this one.
2 : ok
2 : here
1 : yeah, so treasure discard pile
2 : and now you pull two.
1 : then two flood cards
1 : so temple of the moon and iron gate
3 : temple of the moon and iron gate
2 : right h oh sun, temple of the sun
1 : yeah
1 : oh wait
3 : temple of the moon
1 : temple of the moon
3 : and the iron gate, right here
2 : iron
2 : gate
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : it's uh my turn
3 : alright
3 : mmhmm
2 : and
2 : three actions.
2 : hmm
2 : well i'm going to umm, flip this back over,
1 : umm
2 : is everybody
1 : yeah
2 : agree
3 : ok
3 : yeah
2 : and
2 : this doesn't count as an action, so i'm gonna play this
2 : and i need to flip something,
1 : uh
2 : so
2 : i think it's
2 : useful to flip
2 : this one.
1 : yeah, i mean i don't think it makes a huge difference either way, but it's
1 : probably better in the long run.
2 : ok yeah. oh that doesn't count so i still have two actions
1 : then
2 : where i can
2 : give a treasure card
1 : mm
2 : but
2 : or move
2 : so i'm gonna choose to move forward and move back
1 : oh yeah
2 : and now pull two of these
2 : oh
2 : and i have to play this.
1 : water's rise card
2 : move the water level up one tick
1 : so now it's at three
2 : and shuffle these cards
2 : and discard this. and now it is
2 : your turn.
3 : ok
1 : but we you have to umm do the three cards.
2 : wait?
2 : oh
2 : sorry
2 : temple of the moon,
1 : ok, so temple of the moon gets flooded
2 : breaker's bridge,
1 : hmm
2 : which
2 : mm
3 : 
1 : oh wait, it's this one.
2 : and the lost lagoon.
3 : lost lagoon,
3 : ok.
3 : alright, so i've got uh
3 : helicopter lift two helicopter lifts.
1 : you should give the fire card to me as one of them, because then i can get the fire card.
3 : uh
3 : yup
3 : so
3 : does that
3 : count as one action?
2 : yeah
2 : yup.
1 : wait, wait, are we have to make sure you can do that.
3 : ok
2 : umm, is he next to you?
2 : red and blue?
3 : give i can give a treasure card.
2 : yup
3 : so
1 : ok, yeah
1 : wait, don't, don't we have to be on the same tile?
3 : ok
2 : oh, same tile
3 : ok, ok
1 : oh so you, so you should move
2 : move next to him
3 : ok
1 : yeah, you should use one move to move over to me.
3 : cool,
3 : alright.
1 : then
3 : then give you a treasure card, ok
1 : yeah
1 : then
2 : and flip
3 : and then
2 : breaker's
1 : one, two, three
1 : wait, i have to discard one card
3 : right
2 : ok
1 : so
2 : chalice
3 : get rid of that one
1 : probably, just yeah, discard the chalice.
2 : and you should flip
3 : right
2 : breaker's bridge, since one you're next to it.
3 : ok
1 : mmhmm
3 : and uh, then take two
2 : oh
3 : treasure deck cards.
2 : well, you know, these don't count as a move, so you can play one of them if you think it's strategic to move somewhere,
2 : right now.
3 : ok
1 : uh
1 : well
1 : you
1 : both of you guys have a statue of the wind card
1 : so
2 : oh, true
1 : because you're all the way up here
1 : so if he flies up to you then
2 : well i can give him a card at any time.
1 : well, yeah you, yeah cause you're just the messenger, yeah
2 : so on my next move i can give him this card, so it might be strategic for you to fly
1 : yeah, to fly over to either whispering garden or the howling garden.
2 : next to
3 : ok
2 : actually, well that's funny, that's right there. so umm i would say he can move over and flip that so you should fly right here so
1 : mmhmm
2 : on your next move you can flip iron gate
2 : and you can
2 : move to howling garden
2 : until you can discard that.
3 : ok, now i have to take two treasure deck cards.
3 : alright, yeah got to draw
3 : three flood cards.
1 : yeah
1 : here
3 : ok
1 : so we've got whispering garden,
1 : cliffs of abandon, iron gate
3 : iron gate is gone
2 : mm
3 : whispering garden
2 : cliffs of abandon
3 : and what was the other one?
2 : cliffs of abandon
3 : oh, cliffs of abandon right here, ok
1 : yeah, right there.
3 : ok
2 : and
2 : something else?
1 : and umm
3 : iron, iron gate is completely it's off, submerged.
1 : yeah and whispering garden, cliffs of abandon, iron gate, so we got all of them.
2 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : ok, so now it's my turn.
1 : so i'm gonna use one move to move down to cave of shadows
1 : and then since we have
1 : we need four cards right
2 : mmhmm
1 : so
1 : got the four fire cards
1 : and so
1 : just put them in the
1 : treasure discard pile, then
3 : ok
1 : we
1 : have this
1 : i guess, 
1 : so, then umm
1 : does that count as a move, capturing trea? yeah, that counts as a move, yeah
2 : yeah
2 : capture a treasure card, you moved, then you can do one more thing, can you shore up anything? aw, you should've shored up before you moved.
1 : eh, eh, eh, umm
1 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : well
1 : whoops
2 : can't shore up anything now
2 : so
1 : i'll
2 : you can
2 : move
2 : next to something
2 : like right here
1 : yeah, and then next round i can shore up cliffs of abandon, whispering garden
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : you may
2 : capture a treasure and a flooded tile
1 : wait, when you capture a treaure
2 : win your treasure gem, discard the treasure pile and move the figure in front of you.
1 : m, move the figurine in front of you.
2 : oh ok
2 : iron gate
2 : oh, discard this
1 : oh yeah, we have to, yeah
3 : ah, ok
1 : get that outta there
2 : oh and did we uh
2 : discard
2 : something?
2 : no?
2 : ok
1 : ok, yeah
1 : so
1 : then, two treasure cards
1 : so that and that
1 : then
1 : flood cards.
1 : so howling garden, crimson forest, and copper gate.
2 : ok, howling garden,
1 : crimson forest,
2 : crimson forest,
2 : copper gate
1 : copper gate.
2 : so, our most
2 : important
2 : cards to flip over are the ones that have special things on them.
2 : umm
2 : now's my turn
2 : so i'm going to
2 : flip
2 : to shore up
2 : this tile
2 : and
2 : move
1 : uh
2 : i was thinking move here
2 : shore up,
2 : shore up this tile.
1 : y
1 : well
1 : yeah, you should definitely stay around here because then we both have one of the
1 : these cards, so we can give ah wait, but we've gotta be umm
2 : yeah
2 : well, i can give you a card
2 : anywhere.
2 : umm
2 : ya'll can only give me a card if you're next to me.
1 : mmhmm
2 : the other tile for this is right here, so maybe, perhaps i should give you
2 : umm
2 : well that's funny, you have two of those. but if i gave you one of these cards
2 : or i could
2 : i think it's important to shore up the
2 : copper gate
2 : gate card, but i could give you one of my cards and on my next turn give you another cards, and he has one card.
2 : ya'll are next to each other.
1 : so we yeah, and so i just stay down here to capture this down here, yeah.
2 : he can give you a card.
2 : yeah
2 : yup
2 : so
1 : ok yeah, let's do that
2 : i'm gonna move here
2 : wait, now that we have three turns, if i moved,
2 : i flipped this, i shored up
1 : yeah, so that's one turn,
2 : i can move here
1 : two turn
2 : and shore up
2 : or i could umm
2 : i think i should shore up, because we're pulling three everytime.
2 : what do you think, is it more important to give you one of these?
3 : shore up
2 : oh no, because i'm already here, so it doesn't matter, so
1 : i, i
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : yeah
2 : cause he can always fly to me and give me that.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so i'm gonna move here and shore up here
2 : and then
2 : pull two of these.
1 : yeah cause definitely, you'll get one of those cards
1 : when you pull from the treasure deck.
2 : ok
2 : and a water rising,
2 : so
1 : so then we have to reshuffle all of these
2 : yup
1 : mm and then
1 : draw three.
2 : this is cliffs of abandon,
1 : so
2 : oh cities of abandon.
1 : copper gate,
2 : no cliffs of abandon.
2 : this sinks
1 : ok, so yeah, cliffs of abandon is gone.
1 : so we gotta put that there too
2 : and temple of the moon
1 : up here.
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : alright
2 : so
1 : ok
2 : now it is your turn
3 : ok
2 : and you should definitely use the sandbags to save
2 : one of these tiles with a umm
2 : oh,
2 : discard water's rise? ok
1 : yeah, so you should, you should definitely use sandbags for like temple of the moon.
3 : ok
3 : so sandbags, temple of the moon and
2 : and you
2 : could,
3 : umm
2 : you could fly over
2 : to me
2 : umm
2 : and give me one of these cards.
3 : i could yeah i could give you one of these, yeah, that was what i was thinking.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah, that's a good call.
3 : uh
2 : wait,
2 : wait, where are you?
3 : i'm over, i'm over here.
1 : he's all the way
2 : here
1 : yeah, he's all the way down there.
2 : he should shh
3 : so you're
1 : shore up howling yeah, cause whispering garden's also s
2 : shore up howling yeah, yeah
1 : flooded too.
2 : shore up this up
2 : first.
3 : wait a minute
2 : you're here.
1 : so sandbags doesn't count as a move
3 : ok, that, that's good, that's good, that's what i've been getting confused about
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : so, ok so, i'm right here and then
2 : shore this card
3 : shore up this,
1 : shore up how howling garden, yeah
3 : ok
2 : what move is that? number one or number two?
1 : that's one, because sandbags doesn't count as a move.
2 : ah
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : so, that's one
3 : and then
1 : then
1 : fly over to
2 : i think you should fly here cause on your next turn you could shore this up
1 : yeah
2 : and then
3 : so if, if i, if i m
2 : actually
3 : turn this over, do i have to move here?
1 : no.
2 : no, no, no.
3 : ok, ok.
2 : wait, do you have to be near me to give me a card, or on the same you have to be on the same
3 : has to be on the same
2 : so you should fly here.
1 : yeah, fly to crimson garden
3 : yeah,
3 : right
2 : second move and give me a card for your third move
3 : ok
1 : third move
3 : ok, great.
2 : so i have five cards now.
2 : ok
3 : and then i have to don't i have to pull two cards, ok, yeah. and i also have to take
1 : yeah, you pull two, yup
2 : yup
3 : wait, i have to pull
3 : treasure deck
3 : and i've gotta
3 : pull two of those flood cards. ok, so i got this and this one
3 : and
1 : three flood cards, yeah.
3 : three flood cards, ok.
2 : oh, oh and then we don't shuffle, ok.
2 : so one,
2 : two, three.
3 : ok, so
3 : oh wait, there are these were four, uh i'll just
2 : oh
3 : put
3 : the
3 : what should i put, the top one back or the bottom one?
2 : bottom one.
3 : bottom one? ok
1 : yeah, bottom one.
3 : ok, umm so then that would be uh lost lagoon, whispering garden
2 : ooh
1 : so, lost lagoon,
2 : whispering garden
3 : is out.
1 : whispering garden
3 : ok, howling garden.
1 : howling garden.
3 : ok.
2 : no
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : those go here
3 : oh, yeah, that's right, those go right here, so
1 : well
3 : th
1 : umm
1 : l
2 : well lost lagoon and whispering garden
1 : lost lagoon and whispering garden yeah go in there.
3 : whispering garden, yeah
2 : ok
1 : so we also have to
3 : yeah
1 : make sure we
1 : take care of that one, because if that goes under, that's bad.
3 : right
2 : ok so now it's your turn.
3 : mm
3 : 
1 : ok so
1 : umm
2 : you have the chalices but
2 : right now it's strategic to flip things over
2 : so you cause we can always take care of these on our turns, so you should flip this one over.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah so i shh
1 : if i move one, two
1 : then i can shore this up, yeah
2 : you can flip
2 : yup
1 : do you think that's the right call?
2 : or if you move one, two
1 : yeah, i mean, yeah, it's the same end result.
2 : yup
1 : one,
1 : two, that's
1 : two moves,
1 : flip this one over.
1 : ok
1 : so those are my three moves
1 : then
2 : and now you pull two.
1 : yeah
1 : oh perfect
2 : oh
1 : and then we got the two chalice cards
2 : and go back there
3 : perfect, ok
3 : good.
1 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : three flood cards.
1 : so
1 : cave of embers, crimson forest, and breaker's bridge.
1 : so
1 : crimson forest is out,
2 : is out
2 : and we're both flooding, i mean we're swimming
3 : we're stranded right now.
2 : so we're gonna move on our turns to one.
1 : cave of embers,
1 : flooded.
2 : and breaker's bridge
1 : breaker's bridge
2 : crimson forest is out
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : and now it's my turn.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so, i'm going to swim
2 : well no, i need to s
2 : we need to swim to the same card, so that you can give still give me a card. so i'm gonna swim
3 : temple of the moon
2 : temple of the moon,
2 : umm that's not a move.
1 : nnhmm
3 : i would shore up
2 : oh
3 : copper gate, wouldn't you?
2 : can we do that while we're swimming?
2 : can i undo that?
1 : i don't think so.
2 : no
2 : ok.
1 : you can make another move
1 : down here
1 : because that, that didn't count as a move. so you can move one down here, shore that up,
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
1 : then
2 : should i be giving any cards to anybody, no? so move down
1 : no, i don't think you have to.
2 : and shore up.
1 : wait, actually
1 : what if
1 : as a move, you gave him the statue of wind card, cause he already has two, and then he can fly down there
1 : cause then he just needs one more.
2 : statue of the wind card?
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : because we just need three treasures and we've got the chalices right here.
2 : well now i move so should i shore up or should i give him the statue of the wind? i can always give it to him
2 : any time
2 : on my next turn, after he flies down,
2 : like
2 : so if i shore this up now
1 : oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that yeah.
2 : so shore up
2 : umm, i'll give it to him on my next turn.
1 : ok, yeah
2 : and
2 : pick two of these.
2 : i got a chalice
2 : and i got one of these,
2 : so i will
2 : i can't have more than five.
1 : probably discard the
1 : fire card.
3 : yeah, discard the fire card.
1 : yeah, cause we already got that.
2 : two, that's still five, so i have to discard this as well.
1 : yeah, i mean we don't need that either.
2 : ok
2 : and
2 : oh yeah, on my next turn i can give him both.
1 : yup
2 : ok, so i have to pull th well, no we don't have to shuffle. pull three of these.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so, silver gate,
2 : dunes of deception,
2 : and
2 : coral palace.
