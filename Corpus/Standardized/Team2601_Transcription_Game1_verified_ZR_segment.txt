1 : ok so, i go first then.
3 : k.
1 : umm
2 : so i think we should like
1 : uh
2 : figure out which tile's the most important to definitely maintain and not be sunk.
1 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
2 : ah then the others, so like for example, this one i think can be ok but we have to keep in mind that we don't have
3 : yeah i don't want to get stranded too, so we should probably take care of this area.
1 : yeah. i think
2 : yeah so we've  got them
1 : i think we should maximize saving bascially the board and then the cards will just kind of come and then we can get close to each other when we need to sort of
2 : and then you gotta keep in mind though that each time we keep playing it draws a flood so it's going to get more and more so we have to be efficient with everything as well
1 : yeah.
1 : ok umm
2 : mm
1 : so
1 : i guess i'll use my first action to shore up both these two cause they're just right next to me
1 : and i can use my thing more than once right?
2 : umm yes name$$$ you can do, yeah so you can do two and then you can move and do two if you wanted to
1 : ok
1 : so these are adjacent so i might as well do these two
1 : then i can
1 : move here
2 : ok
1 : as my second action and then i can get these two also
2 : ok so it'd be three actions ok
1 : and that's all three and then i get two treasure cards
2 : you get a water's rise.
1 : ok water's rise and then i got the chalice.
1 : umm so
1 : this goes in the discard right? and then
2 : yeah
2 :  once
2 : we have to shuffle all these and put them on top then?
1 : ok
2 : yeah so
2 : i do
2 : i'm shuffling incorrectly
2 : put em on top
2 : and we draw two.
1 : alright gold gate and lost lagoon.
2 : alright so gold gate is then
3 : get em
2 : sunk
1 : that's sucks
2 : and then that takes with the card itself so gold gate
2 : yup and what was that lost lagoon?
3 : yeah
1 : oh it's over here again
2 : ok
1 : ok cool alright so now we defintely gotta make sure we don't
2 : so it's flooded
1 : no never mind, i thought that was a treasure card, never mind.
2 : ok so now it's my turn?
1 : ok.
1 : umm
1 : yeah
2 : yup alright so three actions so
2 : umm
2 : let me see here
2 : so you're at whispering garden, you're at fool'slanding, you have one chalice, you don't
2 : that count as an action or i can move, umm
3 : hmm.
2 : what do you guys think i should do?
1 : i think
1 : huh
1 : you could move, i don't think giving a card at this point would necessarily help because if you give one to me because i can only hold five you know what i mean then i'm i already got two of these.
2 : right true so you have one 
3 : so if you
3 : can move twice it would be two actions? and then you could
1 : yeah
3 : shore up lost lagoon maybe?
1 : yeah and then you'll still be next to me and i could give you this
2 : ok and you're able to
3 : or i could fly you guys over, but i don't know if i want to use that.
2 : so you're able to give me a treasure card if it's on the same, if we're on the same tile. ok.
1 : yeah whenever it comes back to my turn
2 : ok so you guys want me to save lost lagoon? is that the most important thing to you?
2 : cause i would argue that lost lagoon is not that important.
2 : umm because
2 : it's not necessary for us to really
1 : yeah it's definitely true. do you think moving to the center of the map so maybe you have more accessibility to other places would be better?
2 : yeah i think that'd be good cause then i can we'd have better opportunity for us you can move anywhere you want, but for us like to flip to make sure we shore up cards umm as it comes, so i'll probably move umm
2 : i'll move twice and i'll move to phantom rock cause that doesn't really matter that much. is that are those the only two flooded cards that we have?
1 : yeah it looks like it
3 : hmm
2 : ok so i'll move
1 : less
1 : yeah not yet ok
2 : i can move to copper gate
2 : ah twice and then umm
2 : i don't have to shore up anything. so that's all i can, i don't have to do anything else really.
2 : yeah.
2 : so i'll just do that. i'll move twice and then ll just finish my turn. is that ok with everyone?
3 : mmhmm.
1 : yeah it's good with me.
2 : alright. i'll do that.
2 : two treasures.
2 : so i have ah sandbags.
2 : so i can play at any time.
2 : and that said shore up any one tile ok. so we'll keep that and i have one of these so i'm the only with these two so far so keep that in mind. alright, and then
1 : ok gotcha
1 : gotcha
2 : draw two floods
2 : so we have breaker's bridge and phantom rock, so phantom rock is sunk.
3 : oh no
2 : and you take that as well
1 : breaker's bridge is
1 : right here
2 : ok so that's, so those two are flooded so
1 : alright
1 : alright cool
2 : ok ok cool your turn
1 : right
3 : alright umm
3 : let's see
3 : i could
3 : i could shore up those cause i could move
3 : as one of my actions i can move wherever.
2 : right that's
3 : the two  but if those aren't
3 : our main concern
3 : umm
1 : i think shoring up this, i think having the this like
1 : out doesn't really matter and makes the game board smaller in terms of like moving places.
3 : yeah
1 : plus it's like if lost lagoon comes up it's just like
1 : not having to worry about like losing one of the important ones kind of
3 : mmhmm.
2 : so yes, you could you could choose to move to it use a special ability you could choose to move one over and then still be able to shore it up cause it's adjacent to you. so you could have those choices.
3 : ok
1 : yeah true.
1 : i think that's probably our best bet.
3 : alright so maybe i'll do that.
2 : yup ok
1 : alright.
1 : and then
2 : do you want to take a third action or
3 : one two, umm
2 : no i think
3 : 
1 : yeah
3 : don't know what else i'd do
1 : you are the only one with the wind so i think
2 : you can move one more if you want like if you want to move back so you can cover like this area better but that's up to you
3 : umm
2 : cause right now cause you guys are
2 : sort of adjacent diagonally i don't know if that's if you want to cover most area or not. that's up to you.
3 : maybe i'll move back just cause 
2 : ok
3 : actions ok umm
2 : because that
1 : yeah that's fine with me.
1 : alright so now you get two cards.
2 : alright
3 : ok
2 : two cards
3 : so, another helicopter lift.
3 : and one of the treasures.
1 : ok so i have two of the fires, so i need to get the fire from you as soon as i can.
2 : ok so you have two of them
3 : and then
2 : which means you guys have to be on the same tile eventually
3 : do we mixed those back in the
2 : oh not yet cause we didn't get a flood right?
3 : flood thing?
3 : i think you s
3 : do you still draw even if you don't get those?
1 : yeah you still draw no matter what.
2 : you still draw two, but we don't shuffle them yeah. so you have two of these yeah
3 : you don't mix it back up? ok.
1 : you don't have to shuffle it back up.
3 : right so cliffs of abandon, and whispering garden.
1 : whispering garrden's where i am.
2 : ok
1 : ok
3 : ok
2 : nice, that's convenient. ok so let's just put them right here then. ok.
1 : cool.
3 : yeah.
1 : ok so it's my turn. i should get to you so i can
1 : do we have to be on the same one or adjacent?
2 : you have to be on the same one
3 : yeah to give you that
1 : on the same one?
2 : that's true yup.
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : i could
2 : and
1 : get there but it would take me all three of my moves and then
2 : you can keep in mind that she can fly to you at any point as well.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : she can fly at any point to me? she doesn't have to be
2 : yeah any tile
2 : yeah she can she's ah
1 : and not even your turn?
3 : it has to be my turn
2 : well it has to be her turn but it's to keep in mind you can technically move anywhere you want and she can always get to you.
3 : but
1 : ok
1 : true and if i get one more card or two more else i'll still be at five so i won't have to discard anything. see that's fine. i can then
2 : right.
1 : ah
1 : i guess i can just
2 : so
1 : take these two as my first action
2 : hmm
1 : and fix them
2 : ok and keep in mind yeah so the two that you have for the fire it's are these two right here. so you have to
1 : yeah so i might as well move towards it
2 : yup 
1 : umm so
1 : and then i'll move in towards the center cause being on the corner i don't think is the best idea
2 : ok
1 : alright
1 : good alright
2 : alright
2 : yup and i need two.
1 : oh i got a fire one too that's good.
2 : ah
2 : alright fire then ok and two flood
2 : yup
1 : ok we still got temple of the moon and iron gate.
2 : temple of the moon's there, iron gate's there.
3 : mm. here's iron gate
2 : ok
2 : alright so it's my turn
2 : umm
1 : look
1 : you should definitely see a temple of the moon just cause it's
2 : ok yeah i can do that
1 : one of the
1 : ones we need basically
2 : so i'll move shore up and then
1 : then
2 : no one needs any of my cards right now
1 : no i don't think so. so i think you're fine staying at the top of the board.
3 : hmm
2 : and i have four cards. i have four cards which means that when i get the next two, i will have to discard one of these.
1 : shore up.
2 : so i could just use this.
2 : ah well there's no is there really any point in using it because.
3 : oh.
1 : no not really.
3 : i would wait till i get
3 : use that for like once i get around here.
1 : yeah i would save that for whenever we get into a dire situation. i'd rather get rid of an idol than get rid of sandbag card.
2 : sure.
2 : ok
3 : cause right now we can get wherever really 
2 : well i would so is there so this is what i'm thinking. is it cool if i
2 : i would move here, shore up and then move
2 : back just because i'd still have like a good
1 : yeah that's good with me
3 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : ok i'll do that
1 : alright cool
2 : move back, i'll get two treasures which i'll have to discard once the water's rise.
2 : so we have to move that one up
2 : umm
1 : now you gotta draw three of them after you shuffle them back in
2 : ok so, keep in mind that we have temple of moon and iron gate so we'd like keep in mind also which ones we draw for floods
1 : mmhmm.
2 : alright.
2 : then.
2 : pick three
2 : alright so we have temple of the moon again.
2 : ah cliffs of abandon
2 : ah where's that the middle so its  breaker's bridge.
1 : breaker's
1 : bridghe here.
2 : ok so those are.
1 : ok
2 : ok so it's good that you're near by those.
3 : alright.
2 : engineer. ok.
3 : umm
3 : i'm thinking i'll
3 : go here.
3 : as one of my actions.
3 : i can give a
3 : no i can't give a card. yeah i could give him a card and then since this is adjacent i could shore it up.
1 : yeah you can give a card, i would just have to discard one.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : ok
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : here
3 : give me this one.
1 : i'll discard this one since you have the air one already i can
2 : 
1 : we can both like try and give you the so discard this one into the dicard pile
2 : ok
1 : umm and then
2 : ok
3 : and i'm gonna shore this up
1 : perfect
1 : ok cool alright, you gotta draw your cards
2 : ok cool
3 : yeah
3 : alright so
3 : i have a treasure and sandbags.
1 : nice.
2 : and then whispering and lost lagoon. so lost lagoon is officially sunk.
1 : so
2 : so you can put that with the card
3 : ok.
1 : take that out
1 : and whispering garden
1 : right here
2 : it's flooded yeah.
3 : ok
3 : i'll put that  thanks.
2 : ok.
1 : ok umm alright. so my turn then?
1 : umm so i guess i will
1 : umm
1 : shore up this one right? cause i can shore,
1 : i can move,
1 : and then i can capture the treasure and those could be my three moves right?
3 : mm
2 : shore, move and then
3 : umm wait
2 : so the current the
3 : you can't go
3 : oh yeah you can't go diagonal cause you're an engineer right?
1 : no no no but i can i can't
1 : move diagonal
2 : and shore
1 : or
3 : oh you're not even moving there anyway. you're just ok i gotcha.
1 : yeah yeah.
2 : the concern i have then we'd is  that ok we have howling garden and whispering garden so
2 : umm so there's a possibility that
2 : umm is there a possibility that ah
2 : you might draw a flood that would be whispering garden?
1 : no whis unless we draw a water's rise, we're not gonna draw whispering garden.
2 : ok and then that's a risk in itself. so i mean
1 : i think that's a risk we take
3 : could you
1 : but also
3 : mm
1 : umm
2 : so is that this was the cave of embers, so it's you can move, shore up both
3 : i could
1 : mm.
2 : move back and then you can
3 : hmm
1 : we also have two sandbag cards. so if we have to play one we can play one on whispering garden.
1 : umm
2 : there are two sandbags. we also have two helicopter which we could save one in case for fool's landing.
2 : but technically it's like
1 : something we could do is she could play
2 : she
2 : helicopter move you wherever so you could
1 : so like i could move here, get both of these, she could helicopter lift me to there
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and then i could capture the treasure.
1 : right?
2 : yeah
3 : mm yeah.
2 : is, it's yeah you can play at any time right? with the helicopter?
1 : yeah you definitely could play the helicopter at any time.
2 : ok.
3 : it doesn't have to be my turn.
2 : ok yeah so we can do that and we can capture as your third.
1 : ok.
1 : so i'll move here.
2 : yup
1 : alright that's one turn right?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : flip both of these.
1 : you'll helicopter lift me here right? discard that.
2 : and so we use that yeah?
1 : and discard these four to capture the fire.
2 : nice ok.
1 : rock on.
2 : cool.
2 : alright.
1 : alright nice. so then i get two of these.
2 : there you go.
3 : yeah.
1 : ok.
1 : definitely give one of those to you when it's my turn.
2 : one, two floods.
1 : yup
1 : what do we got here?
1 : ah howling garden, iron gate
3 : ok iron gate is officially sunk.
2 : howling garden.
2 : ok.
3 : you have the card for iron gate?
2 : ok so this is the only ones flooded. oh that and temple of the moon ok.
2 : alright so now it's my turn umm.
2 : mm. ok i don't th
1 : i think
2 : there's no point in me giving you guys any cards right now.
1 : yeah i think you should get close to me and
1 : her
1 : me and the pilot.
2 : you and the pilot? ok.
1 : yeah so we can give you a card basically
1 : cause we both have the one you need
1 : and then also
2 : and there's the temple of
1 : we'll be close enough to each other where we can both try and give her our card of the air.
2 : ok.
1 : umm, so i think you moving here
1 : and then
1 : shoring up and then moving down one.
2 : the question is do we, do we really is there do we really need to shore that one up if we're gonna if we could just focus on this one?
1 : it's true we could get rid of it
2 : cause we have this one, we just need three we just need two more. so we could try to focus on getting either these two or
1 : and then
2 : these two
1 : that's true. then you could maximize the amount of moves you could take.
2 : and ah, i could use a sandbag.
2 : umm howling garden instead.
2 : and if we focus on getting the statue here instead of that one.
1 : yeah and then we can get rid of all these three together cause we don't even need them if we go once we get the statue.
2 : yeah and then i, and then i need to use a sandbag i could use a sandbag cause i already have five so then that would
3 : wait could i fly for my turn could i fly anywhere?
1 : you get to fly anywhere, yeah so you could fly there.
3 : as one action like
3 : but can i do it like
3 : as two actions?
1 : what do you mean?
3 : so like if
3 : you were to
2 : oh
3 : get closer here
3 : maybe i could fly up
1 : that's true.
3 : shore this and fly back.
1 : that's true if you moved three as your turn
2 : ok
1 : she could then move
3 : just so we're keeping
1 : shore,
1 : move,
3 : the ones like this so we don't
3 : just in case
1 : well wait actually
2 : ok
1 : no i'm not sure we could do that cause if you move three to get on to the same one as her
2 : mmhmm.
1 : she has to take one turn by giving you a card, so then she can only do two things
3 : mmhmm.
2 : yeah so she can't shore and then move back.
1 : although you could just, you could just move then shore and then you don't need to move back because you already gave the card
2 : and then just stay there
3 : or what's this sandbag?
2 : sandbag is just to shore up any card any tile at any time.
3 : so
2 : so yeah i mean
3 : i don't even need to move for this then
2 : yeah i have a sandbag as well so i could umm
1 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : just sandbag that
2 : i can move three
2 : and then when it's your turn you can
2 : trade with me
2 : oh
3 : and also sandbag that one.
1 : yeah
2 : and also sandbag it if you really want to yeah. yeah we could do that. so you want me to do that? all three moves as a turn?  all three turns?
1 : we
1 : yeah
1 : yeah i think that's the best yeah.
3 : yeah
2 : ok so i'll do that.
2 : one, two
1 : alright two
2 : three and then i'll sandbag.
2 : is it ok if i sandbag howling garden?
1 : yeah i think that's smart.
2 : ok
2 : do that, sandbag, ok.
1 : and pick up two cards
2 : two cards of a flood.
1 : and then you gotta get rid of one also, or do you know? i guess you don't cause the flood is yeah discarded.
3 : mm.
2 : no.
2 : so this has a water's rise
1 :  i'll move that up, and then you pick up shuffle.
2 : ah that's three.
2 : two
2 : three
2 : so bridge, whispering garden and cliffs of abandon.
1 : breaker's bridge.
2 : yeah sorry, yeah breaker's bridge sorry and cliffs of abandon.
1 : and what was the third one?
3 : nice
2 : yeah right there so
1 : ok cool
2 :  ok.
1 : alright cool so i think it's
3 : alright so first thing we do is give you this
2 : ok so that's one action. and i have to dis yeah i can discard this since we already have it.
3 : no wait.
1 : yeah
3 : i can't
3 : yeah i can cause we're on the same one
1 : yeah
2 : yeah so i'll discard that and give me that
3 : umm ok
1 : 
2 : so three
3 : umm
1 : then you can fly
3 : i could
3 : shore this
3 : i could do these. i could do
1 : yeah i think you should
1 : i think you should shore up one of the closer ones cause i don't think we're gonna need this because once it's my turn i can give it to him
3 : yeah
3 : you can just go right there yeah.
1 : and then he can just grab this one real quick so we don't even need this one really if it comes down to it
3 : but just because this one's in the middle maybe we should do that one.
2 : i would shore this one. ah we the next flood cards out of the flood cards are coming, i know this is one of them. umm
2 : i mean whispering garden's if we'd lose that that's not a big deal cause there's nothing we need to reach with it and then we could just focus on getting it from here.
1 : yeah true.
2 : so, i would, i would shore up cliffs of abandon
1 : ok i think cliffs of abandon's a smart choice.
3 : ok.
2 : ok so that's
1 : and then i'd
2 : two actions take one more action
1 : stay where you are
1 : i don't know what do you think? last action. i guess you could shore up one more just because
3 : ah
3 : that's 
3 : might as well
1 : might as well
2 : might as well? ok.
1 : yeah alright cool.
2 : alright and two
2 : treasures for you
3 : oh thanks.
3 : ok.
1 : what'd you get?
2 : so you got two of them? ok.
3 : yeah and then another helicopter.
2 : then
2 : you had temple of the moon, so that one's sunk.
2 : top one.
3 : ok so 
2 : and then howling garden's is flooded.
1 : ok so
1 : alright and then  could do that. alright so i think i should
1 : definitely
1 : umm
1 : move
1 : and give each of you my cards
1 : as my turn
1 : because then she'll have three and you'll have the fourth one for
1 : ah the statue.
2 : so that would be all of your three turns by moving
1 : yeah
3 : oh i see ok.
1 : and then i, i think that's the best way cause i don't, i couldn't
3 : so move one, two cards
1 : unless you helicopter lifted me somewhere i wouldn't be able to
1 : save either of these and i think getting you the cards is more important right now especially since we're probably running lower on time. we're probably at least half way through already.
2 : ok.
2 : ok alright so you'll know
1 : so i'll move here and then i'll give you one card.
2 : ok.
2 : ok.
1 : and  your one card.
3 : ok.
2 : and i have to discard one of these so.
1 : yeah i think you're getting rid of that. so yes that way you can give her.
2 : this one?
3 : i need the lion and i could
2 : ok gotcha, ok.
1 : that, although wait.
2 : like what  like both of those?
3 : oh wait, i need to discard one.
1 : i think you discard one of the helicopter ones.
2 : yeah.
3 : i would say so yeah
2 : ok
1 : oh wait
1 : yeah ok yeah sorry.
3 : cause i've
3 : i should probably ok
1 : ok.
1 : so then now i pick up two cards
3 : 
2 : right. yeah.
1 : wow that was really convenient.
2 : alright so we have crimson forest and copper gate.
1 : ah
1 : umm
3 : lose copper gate
3 : and crimson forest
1 : alright cool
1 : alright, i think
2 : right
1 : now i think you should, i realize you can't give that to her and get down here.
2 : oh sorry three, sorry three. so cave of embers as well. so that's flooded.
3 : oh
2 : my bad
1 : no problem
1 : alright so that one doesn't even matter cause it's fire and we already got that so
1 : alright for your turn, i realize that you can't give her that card.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and move two and capture. so i think you should worry about capturing.
2 : you want me to capture? ok.
1 : over
1 : getting and then what she could
1 : yeah
3 : yeah i would capture
1 : and then she could helicopter lift you there
1 : and then doesn't worry about moving.
2 : we, we don't know how certain we are to get a helicopter lift again which we need to get off the island. so i, i think it's
3 : really?
2 : important to have always one.
2 : helicopter lift between us three.
1 : i think that's probably true. i think that's a safe play.
2 : cause
3 : ok
2 : yeah that's a safer it's riskier,it's less risky. i think i could
2 : so i think i could, i think you should use a sandbag to save either howling garden or whispering garden because
1 : yeah we definitely need to save one
3 : yeah
2 : umm, i think you should use one of yours right now to save either one. i think, i think this one is probably best cause it's closer to where we'll need to exit.
1 : yeah i think that's smart.
3 : ok.
2 : umm
3 : i'll do that right now.
2 : ok.
1 : alright cool.
2 : do that, i will so you guys just i'll just move and capture. ok. i'll do that.
3 : i think you should
3 : yeah
1 : yeah i think that's the smartest choice.
2 : alright.
2 : so two and then
2 : use my
2 : these to capture
2 : ok, awesome alright and then i'll get
1 : nice
1 : alright cool and then draw
1 : two cards
2 : two so i have a chalice and
2 : iron and then three
2 : floods
2 : so i have coral palace
2 : dunes of deception and silver gate.
1 : coral palace
3 : ok
1 : who's
2 : so coral palace is wait ah
3 : oh
2 : what you guys are on right now ok.
2 : so that one dunes of deception's right here.
2 : and silver gate's right here. ok.
1 : yeah
2 : there you go. ok so it's your turn now.
1 : ok gotcha.
3 : alright
3 : umm
3 : so
3 : everyone
1 : i think you, i think staying where you are
1 : would be
3 : oh we still have this one, ok.
1 : would be prudent because
1 : ah
3 : do i want to get to him so i can get the li
3 : card
1 : hmm
1 : actually you know what we could do? oh wait, you could fly, you could move yourself to him
2 : yeah i would shore up
1 : which would be one turn and you could give him two of your cards
1 : because his turn comes up sooner.
1 : right?
1 : and then you have all four rather than
1 : like us giving one to you. i don't know if that would work.
2 : so if you're giving me all four which means i would have to take
2 : three turns to see if you can get there so the next turn we're not guaranteed to get a statue.
1 : that's also true.
2 : umm
3 : so i could just fly to this statue.
1 : yeah that is true. that's true. yeah that's smart. yup?
2 : yeah cause it's
2 : it's most convenient.
2 : ok alright so i would say one is to shore up that.
1 : ok.
1 : yeah, yeah definitely.
2 : that you're on coral palace
3 : mmhmm.
2 : i say that's for sure.
2 : ah you don't have to do two more actions but ah
2 : so i mean
3 : ah let's see
2 : would you like to do anything else? would like to move anywhere? is there any reason for you to move anywhere?
3 : umm
3 : might as well just
3 : ah yeah
2 : do you see any reason to do anything else you don't have to?
1 : well you could
3 : i was gonna say i could move here and shore up
3 : another statue thing just in case but we already have this.
1 : hmm, no i think you should move one down.
3 : to get closer to him?
1 : or you could
2 : you could fly anywhere to and you don't
1 : yeah, yeah you know what i mean
3 : yeah
1 : yeah if you're closer to him that's smarter
1 : cause then it
1 : doesn't take effort. he doesn't have to waste a move by
3 : then why don't i just do that cause
2 : ok so just move one ok
1 : cause i could fly anywhere yeah.
2 : alright and then two treasures and three
3 : alright
2 : floods
1 : you'll have to discard one so just get rid of the fire.
3 : three, four, five.
3 : yeah.
2 : alright so you got bronze gate's. tidal palace which is there.
1 : what do we get?
3 : oh.
2 : and then was it temple of the sun?

3 : ok
3 : hmm
2 : ok
1 : alright so it's my turn. i basically just need these and you have one.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : so
1 : i think what i can do is
3 : i have one two
1 : you also have one yeah true.
2 : keep in mind that you don't have to be on the tile that i'm on for me to give you it, cause i'm the messenger.
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah umm
2 : so
1 : ok i think i should
2 : i think
1 : i can shore up two by moving here and get
2 : oh my gosh shit
1 : both of these and that way whispering gard i mean you know, i don't know we don't want the whole map to sink but the main important ones are really right here and those are fine right now.
2 : so what i'm thinking i totally forgot because of my special ability , i'm able during my turn to give you guys cards no matter where you're at so
1 : oh wow
2 : if you wanted
3 : so you could just give me that. ok.
2 : so if you were to just move to that one you were to just move to
2 : guess where you're at.
3 : oh
2 : right.
3 : so if you did want i just go here real quick
1 : yeah true
1 : get these two move back
3 : get them just in case and then
2 : yup and then move back if you wanted to.
1 : ok yeah let's do that so one turn.
1 : get both of these.
1 : and move back. that's the end of my turn. i draw two cards.
2 : ok that's it
2 : ok
1 : ok helicopter lift and water's rise. so water's rise we're still only collecting three luckily.
2 : ok i'll shuffle these and then
1 : we're probably gonna lose.
1 : well
1 : yeah we're probably gonna lose at least one.
2 : that's fine we don't, we don't care if we lose any really. ok so three of them. one, two
1 : yeah a lot of them in the corner we don't really need.

2 : you one
2 : i'll give you one. you have to discard one of yours so.
3 : this one.
2 : ok.
2 : alright so that's my two abilities and then.
2 : i will start moving to fool's landing. i
2 : i'll just move.
