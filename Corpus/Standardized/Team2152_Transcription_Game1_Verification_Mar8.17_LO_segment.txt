3 : the
2 : and used my three actions
4 : we get to wait until it's your turn again to give them to me if i
3 : mm.
4 : still have it
2 : ok cause you're on there two i forgot that both of you were there alright yeah go
3 : so just
3 : ok

3 : if there's nothing but like it's a big one and then
2 : oh yeah we need it though
1 : that's nothing
3 : i could fly like
3 : i mean i might as well
2 : so we don't really need
3 : i might as well just do it just in case like cause there's nothing else just like fly
2 : which one?
3 : here
3 : and then un
4 : unsink it
3 : unsink it
4 : might as well yeah
2 : yeah i guess i mean it's not really that important but

3 : ok so i don't have
3 : yeah alright.
3 : mm.
1 : and this one
2 : what do you have?

4 : i can move here.
4 : and then give you those two
1 : yeah and then give me those two
3 : you may give
1 : oh.
1 : in which case
3 : if both of your pawns are on the same island tile
4 : so that's on my three turns

1 : and then
1 : umm i'll get rid of one of the earth
2 : well use it
2 : why don't you just
2 : oh he just moved.
1 : but
1 : and
4 : yeah  that was my three turns right there moving and then giving him those two
1 : ah i mean i can move you
1 : here i mean it's just

3 : yeah definitely cause i'm not
3 : on anything important
1 : ok and then
2 : no you have to do two of these
3 : oh and then you have four of those so
4 : yeah
