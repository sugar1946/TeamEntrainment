4 : cool.
1 : k so i'm the engineer so
1 : umm i'm thinking of asking for advice but i'm thinking one of my actions should be to shore up two flooded
4 : yeah
1 : tiles next to me. what do you guys think?
4 : i was, i was thinking shore up these, move here then shore up both of these and get all four at the same time.
1 : i think that's an awesome idea so i'm choosing to do that for my two actions, thanks for the good advice.
1 : umm i'm gonna take my umm
1 : two actions like
4 : ah
1 : that
4 : well not in that order but it would be
2 : no
1 : c-ca
1 : oh well
4 : this
1 : she's alread
4 : this, this, then this tehn this.
1 : yeah he's right.
1 : he's right thanks for your help
4 : it means irrelevant but
1 : well no your right, we should
4 : that works better following the rules
1 : proceed in proper order you're absolutely right
4 : cool you're
2 : hmm
1 : right
1 : and then umm she can go
4 : no, no, no
3 : and she yeah, you need to
2 : umm
1 : oh we gotta draw treasure cards, can you hand me, sorry i really can't reach
3 : draw
4 : two
1 : or
1 : there and
4 : what did you get fuck
1 : just so you guys can see unfortunately i did pick a water's rise card so
1 : umm
1 : thank you so she grabbed it and we all know what that means
1 : it says we gotta move the water level up one tick mark
1 : and we now have to shuffle the discard pile and put it on top
1 : and put it in the oh i'm sorry guys
1 : and put it in top of the draw pile
1 : discard this to the treasure
1 : i can't reach where do i put it thank you.
3 : ok
4 : draw two
3 : hmm
3 : two-what
1 : yeah
4 : it's gonna be
4 : these
4 : over here, maybe this one.
1 : yeah umm it's like he said
4 : yeah
4 : oh not oh we're not golden gate
3 : move one of the one's that you flipped
1 : golden gate
4 : oh good it's not a bad thing
3 : hmm
1 : probably not
4 : so that's why we saved it
3 : yeah
4 : ah what's  ah
3 : what's the other one
1 : that's bigger
4 : fuck me
3 : golden gate
4 : hmm
4 : that's unfortunate
3 : ok
1 : well
4 : i'll take that
1 : we lost one, but 
1 :  so i don't
2 : ok
4 : it doesn't matter, we don't have a yellow, there's no treasure. we need to
1 : i know
1 : i know
4 : make sure we just keep at least one of these so you have to save them at all costs
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : three
1 : sounds like a good strategy to me in fact it sounds like you played this before
2 : and fool's landing
4 : no it's just a very very simple board game.
1 : great idea.
1 : so i don't know.
2 : so then i can go umm
3 : k
2 : this
4 : what do you wanna do?
2 : so i should just
2 : go one
2 : mm
4 : mm
2 : i don't know
4 : ok you know you also have special ability, umm i think
4 : your biggest
4 : thing you could do to help us is you have the ability to give things to
2 : yeah
4 : people so for example like
4 : give me
4 : the gold one there and i can focus on this
3 : that way
4 : she's gonna get the chalices, well she'll knock that out
4 : i can knock this out
4 : we could focus on her having these we'll see like where cards go
1 : yeah and i could give you this one cause
2 : yeah
3 : right
4 : you know what i mean? so you should be giving things once per turn i think
2 : yeah
2 : ok then draw this
4 : see whoever has the most
3 : ok
4 : let's see, you're the only one who can do that most easily. she should be saving all the tiles from dying.
3 : now, here?
2 : yeah
1 : i don't like it
1 : yeah i agree i just traded 
4 : and then you can fly us away so we don't get lost. yeah see now if you give me that extra one i'll have three of them now
3 : alright
1 : sounds good
2 : mm
2 : yeah
1 : right
4 : i can move simply here and get that
1 : yeah
1 : that's awesome
2 : oh no
2 : 
2 : i don't think i can take another turn
2 : so this one
2 : draw
4 : that was it?
2 : phantom rock and cliffs of abandon
4 : ok it's gone, give me the phantom rock
4 : take that
3 : and what's the other one?
2 : cliffs of abandon
4 : cliffs of abandon
1 : oh
2 : which i'm on
4 : ok that's ok you're not done yet
1 : that's ok because we could
1 : i'm right next to it and i can go and 
3 : ok
3 : so i can fly myself anywhere
1 : yes ma'am
4 : yeah you can
2 : yes
3 : so tch tch
2 : do you want to fly yourself?
4 : and you have the ability to do those as well
4 : umm
3 : i'm thinkin of
4 : what do we think here again
3 : cause if i fly myself over to lost lagoon, i can flip lost lagoon over
4 : 
3 : and save that
2 : or cliffs of abandon since somebody's on it and you could still
4 : don't go there
2 : if you draw a water rise card then you would have to put
4 : yeah
2 : this back and
4 : but if it's gone it sort of doesn't matter, it's not one that's really important umm.
2 : yeah
3 : right cause it's
1 : plus i'm next to it and i can save it on my next turn
3 : right l
4 : on your turn yeah but
4 : ah see you, we think, you're going to be the most mobile
3 : rigth
4 : so you need to choose what you think you're gonna get so i think your you could end up getting, let's see, you kinda gonna see what you're gonna get
3 : i
3 : right
4 : yeah to be honest with you
4 : if you pull out a couple more of these then that's what you're going to be going with
3 : right
4 : cause you can just fly yourself to whatever one and gather the treasures easily
3 : to wherever i want
3 : right
3 : so right now probably go ahead go lost lagoon, flip it over
3 : and then
1 : yeah cause it's closest to the treasure 
4 : try and save it yeah, i mean  there's no
3 : yeah try and save it
4 : so
3 : oh
4 : save that one
1 : because i could save the one next to me so yeah
3 : and limit somewhat
4 : and now you can you could just end your turn, you don't need to take all three
3 : right
4 : cause it doesn't like
3 : it does matter where i go right no? ok. so and then two of these.
1 : not really
4 : yeah like we'd all
2 : yup
1 : i'm gonna just put this back here.
3 : and i got a helicopter
3 : hmm?
4 : and i want, so be careful you can't draw anymore cards
4 : so you're close to her
3 : right
1 : yeah
4 : so maybe next time you want to give her
3 : right
4 : that
4 : if she doesn't draw it by then
2 : oh
2 : so 
3 : and then two
4 : let's see what happens.
1 : yep
2 : oh no
3 : temple of the moon and breaking bridge
4 : ok
2 : ok
4 : that's not good
4 : can't lose this one
1 : but
1 : you know what i can save two on my turn so it doesn't matter i'm just gonna 
3 : breaker's bridge, yeah
4 : yeah
4 : but, there's a fifty percent chance that when those go back in there it's gone anyway before it gets to you.
1 : maybe
4 : so and i can't get there in time
4 : potentially
3 : alright
4 : ok my turn ah so i don't really
3 : ok now you're turn
3 : you can go diagonal
4 : think that i need to save, well, the only thing i really need to do is make sure that we don't lose this, so i'm gonna save that
1 : yeah thank thank you.
4 : oops
4 : umm nothing else is very important at the moment
4 : ah so i think i'm gonna move there save that and then
1 : mm
4 : move myself back down here to be within range to get this
1 : cool
4 : when i need to
4 : i'll take two treasure cards please.
4 : which i didn't really want
4 : that should be for you.
4 : and you need this one.
1 : yeah
4 : ah now let's see what we got
1 : well 
4 : so we got lucky we didn't get a water rising cause we could have potentially lost everything.
3 : right
1 : yup
1 : i know i'm sorry i 
4 : whispering garden we gotta be careful. we can't lose that.
4 : and iron gate
4 : alright
1 : ah oh
1 : 
2 : can
1 : alright i guess it's my turn and i could use
4 : yeah
1 : umm advice now
1 : it would probably be good if i took one of my actions and flipped that back over huh?
4 : well you can flip both of them, this and this?
3 : flip both of them.
1 : yeah i can do two that's right.
2 : no
1 : what did you say sir?
2 : sorry
3 : it's on vibrator honey
1 : oh
2 : it's not on mute.
4 : yeah it's just
4 : both
1 : ok so yeah i will
1 : take my action and
1 : do that
4 : eh where
1 : do you guys think i should do a second action like?
1 : give her this card so she can
4 : ah
1 : you know what i mean? make a match.
4 : maybe
4 : ah
2 : umm
4 : you need, you're gonna eventually going to hopefully get the ah
1 : the
4 : this water chalice so you need to acta you need to start getting close to it
1 : green ones
1 : i know
1 : but i don't need this one
4 : it's over there.
1 : so i'm thinking i could give you this one
4 : well only if you're on the same tile as her
1 : oh i'm not, i'm not
4 : i believe or if it's if you're adjacent
4 : give a single. nope same tile.
1 : umm
3 : same tile
1 : ok well i'm not
4 : ah so gray. so if you want to, you could move here
4 : and then give that to her and then that would be your
1 : yeah i think
4 : that'd be two actions
1 : i think i want to do that cause there's nothing else i could really save next to me unfortunate
3 : right
4 : no
1 : ok i'm gonna do what he said
3 : well you gotta go on to, right.
4 : well yeah
1 : an
4 : you got it.
1 : i know. i know i was about to.
3 : ok
1 : umm thanks guys.
1 : it's your turn.
3 : ok no two of these
4 : no, no no, no no.
1 : no we gotta yeah.
1 : 
4 : what'd you get?
1 : ok
1 : i'm very sorry cause
4 : water rise? yeah.
1 : i got bad luck but
1 : umm
1 : water rise so i guess i gotta move that up
4 : and then
4 : well first you move it up
1 : move up the water level one tick mark
4 : what?
4 : yeah move it up
1 : oh wait 
4 : up to three
1 : yeah
4 : then
4 : shuffle those up
1 : ok
4 : and we're gonna lose
3 : ok the water rise card will come back over here.
4 : hopefully not whispering garden, or else i have to move a lot
1 : ok
1 : like he said we're gonna shuffle these up.
1 : and
4 : too many of these god damn
1 : ok
1 : discard this card
1 : to the top of the treasure pile sorry guys
1 : and the other one
1 : is this one.
3 : right
4 : yeah
4 : yeah, yeah, yeah ok now keep drawing the three
3 : draw the three
1 : yeah
4 : ah
1 : lost lagoon
4 : do you
4 : were we
4 : was it here before?
1 : yeah it was at two
2 : yeah
3 : yeah this
4 : y ok
4 : it was at two, now it was, now it's
3 : right so it's on the bottom
2 : little
4 : it's not up, yeah it's not up to
1 : oh
1 : sorry
4 : well you moved it up two, we don't want to be up there
1 : i'm
1 : cri no we don't
4 : alright
1 : alright well i have lost lagoon, whispering garden and 
4 : draw another one. you have to draw three. and this is gone that's not what i wanted.
3 : you
3 : need three cards
1 : yeah that's what i thought
1 : and i also have the temple of the moon
4 : ok this one's gone
2 : hmm
2 : so no
1 : sorry
4 : that's not good. lost lagoon
1 : yeah he's right
1 : eh it's over he it's over here next to her
2 : temple of the moon
4 : ah and then temple of the moon's right there
3 : mm i'm under lost lagoon
4 : that's ok
1 : but she's ok because
4 : well so we lost one of, so now i have to be over there
1 : i'm sorry guys.
2 : yeah
4 : god
4 : it's not your fault. it's statistics.
1 : i know.
1 : because the way they keep putting the same cards 
2 : ok umm so i'm going to
3 : ok your turn
4 : fuck
3 : so you're able to give pieces right?
2 : give him this.
4 : yeah that's a discard so
3 : ok
2 : and
2 : then
2 : should i
4 : ah draw these so i can get rid of
3 : well maybe not give her give you that until
2 : should i flip
2 : this over since i'm right by it?
4 : no
4 : that's a good ide-yeah-ahh
2 : no?
2 : since it has the one thing
4 : ah
4 : what are you, you gonna do
4 : i mean have make choices at some point. like we already lost one of the yellow, yellow ones, it's just gonna happen
3 : yeah
1 : i know
4 : umm
1 : it's a game, yeah
4 : we're gonna have to rely on her helicopter lift to get us to
4 : like that should be our way to move to the places where we can capture treasures at so
1 : that makes sense
4 : but if you want to yeah there's nothing else you can do that this moment umm
2 : yeah
2 : so i'm just gonna
2 : flip this over.
4 : yeah you need to go to it and then flip it over.
2 : oh
4 : so you're on that now.
2 : yeah so that's
3 : ok so
4 : you also have sandbag's so you can just, you could have saved it without
2 : oh
3 : well she can save, she can save another one without
4 : umm it's not important
4 : well eventually she can save well
3 : so she has three turns right? so can't she?
4 : that's if
4 : well that was, that was all three
2 : i already took
3 : oh ok
2 : those three
4 : that's ok cause now you're gonna, so now you're gonna have five and you pull those two and you won't have to discard anything yet.
2 : mmhmm
4 : so it was smart to give away one to me.
2 : yeah so i got sandbags and another one.
4 : now you have two sandbags.
4 : that's the one i want
3 : name$$$
2 : no, don't you have these?
3 : shh
2 : 
2 :  cliffs of a
2 : bandon
4 : can i, can i see them?
4 : shh
3 : cliffs of abandon
4 : what's the other one?
2 : ahh
4 : breakers
2 : iron gate, so we lost that.
1 : 
4 : gone i'll take that
1 : sorry did you say iron gate? ok
2 : no that's the wrong one
3 : and breaker's bridge
1 : ok
2 : sorry
2 : and breaker's bridge yeah
1 : ok
4 : ok that's ok
3 : ok
4 : ok
3 : ok now
4 : let's just c these count as actions right?
1 : mm
3 : yeah, no
4 : they don't count playdate does not count as an action, excellent. alright
3 : so i can
1 : k
4 : umm
3 : i can fly anyone, anywhere
4 : yeah i kinda want you to use one of those
3 : so where do you want to fly cause i gotta get rid of a card
4 : i want. i want to go here.
3 : ok go there.
4 : i wanna
3 : ok
4 : have this and capture that
3 : and then
3 : i can fly myself anywhere that we need
3 : or
1 : yup
3 : and i can also flip something over
1 : and i can flip two more 
3 : ok
4 : yeah we don't, you dont have to use it right now i mean, unless you wanna fly. don't
3 : so
4 : save this
3 : right, i'm saving that
1 : no i'm saving it for later, yeah 
3 : but
3 : why don't i flip two cards
3 : cause i have
2 : can you flip two cards?
3 : or can i have f
4 : no she only flipped one
1 : only i can
4 : so if you want to just fly yourself somewhere and just save a tile that's fine.
3 : ok
4 : it would be better if this wasn't so contricted
1 : are they all?
3 : ch, ch, ch, ch what is better to save?
4 : umm
3 : we gotta save something. probably this one huh?
2 : yeah but you can't
4 : i think this cause the
3 : the n lost lagoon, because once we right
4 : cause one way we can lose is if
1 : yeah
4 : they're stranded. so if we would have got rid of here
1 : yeah
3 : right
4 : they would have had limited ability to get out of there. you're the only one who can fly away from everything and i can move diagonally so i can skip easily too.
3 : right
1 : mm
1 : but i can't
4 : but they can
3 : right
4 : umm so that was it for you unless you want to fly
3 : so that's
3 : that's two moves right?
2 : that's
4 : well
4 : well you flew yourself there to do that
3 : i was there
4 : oh you're blue
3 : i'm blue. so i was there.
4 : ok yeah
3 : so i got one more
3 : so
3 : it might be smart
4 : umm
3 : i'm going to fly here
4 : with me ?
3 : with you only because i can do s
3 : two people i can move two
4 : you can move us both
4 : yeah
1 : oh 
3 : if need be at some point
4 : what?
4 : what are you pointin at
2 : only once per turn
4 : oh i think she, she didn't fly
4 : she was here
4 : you started here didn't you?
1 : choo
2 : yeah
3 : yeah i started there
1 : shoo
4 : then she flipped it, then she flew here.
4 : she never actually flew anywhere.
3 : right i never moved myself.
1 : shoo
4 : she used
4 : helicopter lift to fly me.
1 : yeah she didn't actually play them
3 : yeah
4 : which is different then hers
4 : umm
3 : ok so now this
4 : see what you draw
4 : hopefully not waters, ooooo
3 : ok
4 : that's very convenient
1 : that's awesome
3 : and then
4 : so either you can give it to me
4 : and i'll capture that or she can give it to me if we're on the same tile
3 : and ch ch ch, three
4 : three
1 : and
1 : maybe we could trade a bunch and like
3 : three st na 
4 : yeah
1 : i could give you that one and you could trade me so i could meet
3 : messenger, three
2 : oh
1 : do you want
1 : that or 
4 : mmhmm. yeah i'm i'm savin this one for you.
3 : three not four.
2 : no i keep grabbing
1 : cool
1 : i'm saving this one for you
3 : oh ok
4 : wow, i don't know if i want to be the one that gets it.
1 : 
1 : and you want
3 : ok copper gate
1 : right
2 : copper gate
4 : copper gate
4 : what else
1 : or i could just go over to
4 : crimson forest, ok what else
3 : crimson forest and temple of the sun
4 : ok temple of the sun, we gotta
1 : ok
1 : temple of the moon is there but not the sun
2 : we've
3 : ok
4 : shuffe them one two
1 : oh i thought we were oh ok
4 : ok
4 : so now
3 : mm
3 : k you're turn, so
1 : it's your turn
4 : yeah so i really can't
4 : i don't even really want to
4 : necessarily do anything
1 : you don't have to
4 : umm
4 : so i want to keep these i wanted to get rid of these two, when i draw two
4 : umm
4 : what i can do, cause you already have five, you have five
3 : ok question
1 : i only have three so
4 : i can't give anything to you.
1 : i only got three
4 : two three, one two
4 : no this is not gonna help
4 : if i could get to you in two turns, i could give you this.
4 : but i can't, i can only get there in three turns so therefore i'm using all of my actions.
4 : but you can't die
4 : alright well i don't think i can do anything.
4 : umm
3 : but can you give it
4 : cause i don't want to lose these.
3 : no you can't give it to me cause i have five cards.
4 : nnhmm.
4 : i can't
1 : i only have three but he's not no anywhere near them
3 : ah
4 : so don't, i could give you like
4 : i could give you
4 : one of these if you think you're cause you're the most mobile like i said, well yeah but you're not gonna you don't need this cause i'm gonna get that
3 : but i have
3 : i have
4 : like you don't need that one
3 : yeah 
4 : you know what i mean? like once i gather this, it doesn't matter anymore. these are useless then cause i already captured it. so i could give you this or this
3 : right.
4 : probably this cause she already has two of those
4 : by the end of the day there's
4 : probably at least five times as many as the of these in there as we need, so
1 : probably.
4 : umm, what do you think? cause you can go anywhere you want.
1 : makes sense
3 : well i was thinking if you give me this because we're trying to get all of those to her
3 : ok that way on my next turn i can tran-f-try right
4 : you can fly and then trade both
4 : yeah and then she's pretty close. ok, i like that.
3 : right.
1 : umm
2 : yeah but you already have five don't you so you're gonna have
4 : yeah but she'll just get rid of this cause she doesn't need it. you're gonna give me that.
3 : hmm?
1 : but i don't
2 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : you'll get yours
4 : and then i will
3 : well
3 : we've been getting rid of these
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
4 : there
3 : so we might as well stick with getting rid of one subject.
4 : yeah it's a little risky but yeah. i i
3 : don't know, don't don't know how many cards of each one is in there.
4 : no i, i, i like your
1 : i like your thought though
4 : i like your strategy, i'll take that.
3 : you know.
4 : although i would have just gotten rid of that. the gold one since you don't need it.
3 : yeah but you don't know how many's in there and we know
1 : no you don't it's
4 : we don't
3 : yeah
1 : mainly cause
4 : ah and that's all i really want to do umm cause i'm gonna get rid of this in a minute. can i have two of those?
1 : to make sure
3 : cause i'm the one, that i can get to one of those if need be
4 : yeah water's rising  another one.
1 : k
4 : alright so, one two three four five
4 : get rid of this
4 : and this now, raise it up one.
4 : shuffle those back into there.
4 : and we still gotta raise three
4 : that's not good.
4 : ah-ay-yeah then just one, two
4 : three, we're gonna lose some things here.
1 : yeah
4 : copper
4 : lost lagoon
3 : copper gate
4 : crimson forest's gone, copper gate's gone.
1 : k
4 : ok
1 : k i guess it's my turn. i could use some advice here but
1 : umm and i get up to three turns but i think one obvious move would be to turn this back over
4 : umm
4 : yeah i mean well
4 : yeah if you want
4 : then you save, get rid of that. s-save this one and then move here and save both of those.
1 : but i c
3 : she yeah
1 : i think that's what i was gonna do to  like real honest
1 : so i'm gonna move here. do what you said.
4 : nn then save both of them
2 : no
1 : yeah because we've already lost a lot of stuff.
1 : and that's the closest i could get to because i can't
1 : get the 
3 : right
4 : yeah that's fair
1 : and then i'm done cause i have my three actions so can i have two treasure cards, please?
1 : i have a helicopter lift that works, not another flooding one.
4 : alright good.
1 : and i got this one.
1 : and now i have
1 : the umm.
4 : you don't have to do anything.
1 : one two three
2 : yeah
1 : yeah i only have five so i'm cool so
1 : you can go now
2 : ok i'll
2 : give
4 : yeah give me that ah so now i can capture that. you're gonna want to use at least one of those. so that you don't have to go discard something.
2 : lost
2 : ok so how do we use
4 : umm so
4 : but we don't have anything to sand, well we can sandbag this. does it have to be the same?
2 : this
3 : sandbag this one
2 : does it have to be near me?
4 : ah let me look.
4 : do, do, do, do, do flood cards
4 : what's it say up there? i can't see behind me so
3 : sandbag
2 : umm
3 : ss, ch, ch, ch
4 : any one tile. so you don't have to
4 : so you can just shore up that which is a good idea cause it is a special one.
2 : then
2 : this goes in here and
4 : mmhmm
4 : then you still have one more right? where are you at?
2 : yeah umm
4 : you're eventually gonna get red so maybe move right here
4 : wait no who are you? you're this?
2 : ah i'm going
4 : yeah i think cause you're the gray right?
4 : you're eventually gonna get the red treasure cause you have two.
2 : mmhmm.
2 : so should i just move to cliffs of
4 : yeah you can just move there for now.
2 : mm.
3 : ok
2 : and that's it.
4 : let's hope it's not a water's rise.
2 : ah i got
2 : two
4 : there it is. ok that's good. so you're gonna eve you're gonna save that. umm i'm gonna get this so then next turn we'll have two with
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : mmhmm.
3 : ok.
4 : four
2 : ok
4 : you need one of these
3 : three of them
2 : i'm it's the temple of the moon and temple of
4 : that was a smart move
2 : the sun
3 : you need
4 : ok that's dangerous.
4 : umm if we lose both of those
4 : ah we're gonna be in a prob no but we're gonna be hard pressed. cause we can get three out of four and win.
2 : we lost all guys
3 : ok so
1 : could we
3 : should
3 : she pulls one more cause she needs a three
2 : oh yeah
4 : yeah pull one more.
2 : i forgot
2 : ah
4 : cliffs of a abandon
2 : this was in 
4 : ok that's ok.
4 : that's alright.
3 : ok now what do we need to do here.
4 : you
4 : umm
3 : i need to get this
4 : she's gonna get red, i'm getting this
2 : you
3 : i need to get these
2 : do you
2 : you probably
1 : well guess what i have a helicopter lift so eventually i could get next to you
3 : to her
2 : you probably shouldn't give me your red though because i already have five things so i have to discard
1 : too
4 : yeah so we're focusing on on her now
3 : right
2 : yeah
4 : she can't accept anything else except to get rid of
1 : no
4 : ah
4 : earth
3 : well we only need three pieces right? so
1 : yeah
4 : yeah i've got one, two.
1 : correct
2 : one, two, so if she collects all of them
1 : oh i got two
4 : focus on these, cause we might lose both of these
2 : so
2 : because if she collects all the blue
1 : uh yeah we get that one
2 : then she can discarde both
2 : the purple, gray and then that would work
1 : yeah cause
4 : nnhmm
1 : i can
1 : that that's actually what i was thinking too 
4 : either way umm, you can either
4 : like leave and then come back to mine
4 : cause i want to give you
4 : i think i want to give you this
1 : thank you
3 : ok
1 : i do have a helicopter lift if
1 : you know we'll see what happens but if we want to do that one
4 : yeah
4 : we might need that at the end
1 : yeah
1 : so we could save it too
4 : one of you has save it
2 : shh-she has a helicopter lift
3 : wait a minute
4 : either way you don't need these if you don't wanna do anything. you discard them, they're not important
4 : anymore for you
3 : ch, ch
3 : if i fly
3 : to her
3 : and i can give her one of these, she gots three of these. she can discard
1 : yeah this is use once
3 : one of those
2 : well y
1 : totally it's what i would do
2 : yeah
3 : right.
4 : and then what you could actually do
4 : give it to her and you could fly both of you
3 : right. because of the helicopter.
1 : that's smart cause i can't do that name$$$~21:37:80
4 : to there and then
4 : and then she has three
2 : i think
3 : alright
2 : can't you only fly once a turn?
3 : well
4 : actually no don't fly there, fly here.
1 : umm
1 : yeah do you want to fly me there?
4 : cause then i can get down there and give her this.
3 : right.
3 : cause i can f
3 : i can fly because i'm the pilot
4 : one
1 : and i can't cause if we
3 : one, that's one  move
4 : just hold on
3 :  move two so i give her that and this is discarded.
1 : and then i want to get rid of that yeah
1 : ok that makes sense
3 : ok and now  move three is i use
3 : the helicopter and i fly
4 : well you can discard that right there.
1 : cool
3 : the two of us
1 : cool
3 : there
1 : thank you.
4 : ok so now
3 : ok
4 : we're at if you get those two
4 : i on my turn, i'm gonna instantly grab this
3 : ok
4 : then i'm going to move down and give you this
1 : thank you
4 : you'll finish that
1 : and get rid of that one, cool
4 : and then on your turn
1 : makes sense
3 : ok
4 : you need no you need to then you on your turn you need to use your helicopter lift to get her
1 : to get us out of
1 : oh i will
4 : to red
1 : that makes sense
4 : and then you can just finish that off, cause you're or you could just move there on your turn.
2 : yeah
4 : that's gonna be like, we might need that to save us all.
3 : now
3 : here's the hard part. we gotta pull three.
1 : yeah to get over here.
4 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : hmm
3 : right
4 : we might lose both of these. like we'll see what happens. i don't know.
2 : well
3 : so this is where
4 : we have to be really careful. what did you lose
1 : yeah
3 : silver gate
2 : tidal palace
3 : tidal palace
4 : what else?
3 : and
4 : breakers
3 : breaker's bridge
1 : k
3 : ok so we're still good.
4 : ok
4 : yee
2 : for now
4 : for now, ok my turn so
3 : now it's your turn
4 : capturing a treasure
4 : ah i'll take that
4 : now i'm gonna move down here.
1 : cool
4 : give you that. get rid of that
1 : and then i will, i'm gonna just, can you do me a favor and discard that? thank you.
4 : umm and that's all. that's all three of mine. by moving and then giving.
1 : cool
1 : cool
4 : ah
3 : and now you get two of these
4 : we're actually on the same for all of us
1 : so now you got that
4 : yeah we don't need.
4 : ok so now you have four right?
1 : yeah got all four of these
2 : yeah so trade
3 : ok
1 : i got five, i got the helicopter
4 : ok well first i need to, i need to do
3 : three? right. you need to do three.
2 : oh yeah
3 : that's
4 : you shouldn't lose anything.
4 : cause
3 : right.
4 : the ones  are all down there.
2 : hmm.
4 : ah bronze gate
4 : cave of shadows. it's  risky
4 : dunes of deception
4 : there it is
3 : mmhmm.
4 : ok now this is a very critical move now. now really think about this.
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : i think
2 : she could
4 : well she needs to gather the treasure right away
2 : yeah she needs to gather the treasure right away and then
1 : yeah
2 : she could
2 : t
2 : no
4 : who, what color are you?
2 : gray so i'm in
1 : yeah
1 : yeah i agree you should gather the treasure because everything's flood now.
4 : ok let me calculate this
3 : ok
4 : one two one two one two 
4 : ok
4 : here's what i think we should do
1 : sounds good
4 : so if she gathers that treasure which is the first thing we should do so
1 : yeah i agree let's gather the treasure.
4 : get rid of yours
4 : she she has that helicopter. she could actually fly us all.
4 : at least all three of us to here.
1 : i want to
4 : and then with that
4 : she still has well that
4 : she has one ac
4 : like she'll have one action left. actually it doesn't even count as an action.
3 : well right and she can flip two of them over.
4 : she can fly here
1 : yeah
4 : and then save at least save this one, cause that's where you're gonna go
1 : and then we'll put
1 : honestly i was
2 : mmhmm.
3 : right.
1 : thinking that on my own.
3 : ok
4 : cause then.
4 : when you're there
3 : ok so
4 : you can gather this and then you're right here and then all we need to do
1 : yeah
3 : er
2 : is good
4 : we have three treasures and we can leave. but we need to get a helicopter.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : ok so that's flat
1 : ok
2 : yeah
4 : to get there
1 : ok
4 : so you're gonna come here
4 : take that and then come here and then all we need is one of us to get a helicopter and we can ga and we can win
1 : cool
2 : ok
1 : so i can draw my two treasure cards, that that was very smart.
1 : so
1 : flip this over.
1 : i have a pro
4 : hold up. what?
1 : i have helicopter lift again but i have a
3 : she flipped
3 : ok
1 : what
4 : for what? oh she meant no i don't think mean to do, just this one.
3 : mm right, right we flipped that one.
1 : no
1 : yeah there
4 : ahh
1 : i have a helicopter lift but i have a problem. i got a water's rise card.
2 : well
4 : that's ok. it's ok.
1 : so now we know
3 : and she has the helicopter.
4 : as long as you don't lose fool's landing. you can't, shh this can't be gone before she gets there so that's not a big deal. umm.
1 : but i have helicopter.
1 : i know.
1 : but there is a water's rise card here unfortunately so
4 : ok
1 : sorry guys.
2 : so mm
4 :  all back together
3 : ok
1 : so it's
3 : hmm
1 : phantom garden yeah can you
4 : over there
2 : yeah
3 : water rise goes back in here. so f right shuffle this
1 : sorry
4 : we're gonna win this yet.
1 : sorry
1 : one two
4 : k how do we
1 : sorry guys i always forget the helicopter.
4 : doesn't matter. doesnt matter.
2 : and then
3 : ok and three cards
4 : gave
4 : gave her three.
2 : three cards
2 : one, two
1 : hmm
4 : we can't lose caves anymore so it doesn't matter.
1 : i know.
4 : we just can't
4 : even if you
1 : thank you. ok guys.
4 : i actually kinda want this gone we lose that
1 : umm
1 : we have temple of the sun, temple of the moon
4 : yeah
1 : and criminal
4 : that's what i expected.
1 : forest so
4 : that's exactly what i expected and what else? crimson forest?
1 : crimina
1 : i expected the same thing. oh crimson forest
2 : what is that?
4 : that should. that should have already, that should have already been in here.
1 : i think
4 : ah draw another one. that was supposed to be over here.
1 : oh
4 : we lost that one already. that's what i wanted to happen. ok.
2 : cliffs
1 : ok
1 : i
4 : perfect
1 : think
1 : that
1 : yeah
1 : think that 
4 : yeah so now, you don't have to even move.
2 : ok
1 : cool.
4 : instantly gather that
2 : ok
4 : come to us
4 : now we're all here.
4 : so now
4 : we have all, we have three out of the four
4 : we have all of the qualifications to win
1 : we got a helicopter
3 : and i can pass
4 : and all we need
2 : we just need
4 : all we need now is for you we need someone we just need to either
4 : like we just need to survive until we get here
1 : yeah
4 : umm
2 : oh
4 : well that's really it because you don't, none of us have a helicopter
3 : right
1 : but i got one.
2 : yeah
4 : yeah that's what i'm saying you all have one.
3 : so this is where we have to survive.
1 : yeah
2 : mom sorry
4 : yeah we have to just survive right now for
2 : just let me pick
4 : survive for you know, one more way around.
3 : oh your turn ok.
1 : ok.
4 : cool.
3 : hmm
3 : and then
4 : as long as fool's landing doesn't come up
4 : so as long as we don't draw fool's landing, then someone gets a water's rise and draw fools landing again
1 : ok
4 : what'd you get
2 : oh silver gate
4 : irrelevant
2 : breaker's bridge and tidal palace.
1 : ok given that 
4 : cool.
4 : alrigth, well we're not going anywhere.
1 : because 
3 : ok
4 : ah
4 : yeah these are all gone now.
2 : 
1 : ok
4 : ok we're, we're fine.
3 : ok and then.
1 : but at least we're alive
4 : yeah we're still alive.
3 : i go this way.
1 : i got a helicopter lift so.
4 : it's statistically really improbable right now to draw that and then
1 : yeah
4 : get a water's rise and then draw it again.
1 : that's
1 : true but sometimes things happen but you still get the helciopter lift
2 : what did you get?
4 : yeah take in that
2 : oh well
4 : survive
4 : just survive.
1 : yeah 
3 : three cards.
4 : just hope nothing happens
1 : yeah
2 : ok we've got cave of the shadows
4 : nope.
2 : umm

1 : ah
4 : what?
2 : three things now. fool's landing.
3 : three
4 : ok we we won cause it's impossible
