4 : there's nothing else you can do
2 : umm
1 : do you feel that there's something
1 : that would be better?
4 : she can't shore up diagonally
1 : i can't so i think
2 : i
2 : i know but if you do like one, two and
3 : it's not even really all that necessary
2 : and like three and then by the next turn you can move
2 : there if you wanted but
1 : i want to be there though cause once it comes back around to me i want to get it
4 : hmm
2 : ok but i i mean but if you're like here you could move and then get it, but
1 : oh i see, i see what you're saying
4 : oh ok

4 : he's
2 : i think i'm gonna use
4 : sandbag?

2 : this
4 : ok
2 : umm
4 : and then

1 : was giving two cards, was that one turn?
2 : umm
3 : it's two
2 : no that's two turns.
4 : two
1 : two
4 : each card counts as one turn
2 : yeah each turn i can, i can flip this
1 : ok yeah
2 : and i can stay here
1 : that would be good, that's a really important one.
3 : might as well
4 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : ok, ok, so you have the cave of embers. alright, ok
4 : i
3 : so i'm on the same
3 : oh yep

2 : and you have four of those, so we're gonna get this and then we have to decide like what's the third one we want cause it doesn't really make a difference cause we both have three.
2 : so
3 : ah
2 : umm
1 : if he moves here
1 : and then flip that
2 : yeah he can
2 : flip yeah i mean we already might as well
