1 : oh so i go first right?
1 : yeah ok
1 : i'm gonna
1 : what do you guys think?
1 : i know i can move here.
1 : i guess
1 : shh
1 : shore up
1 : these
1 : two?
1 : and
3 : you can't do it diagonally.
1 : oh
1 : so don't  i'll do the one i'm on
3 : but you can be on
3 : you can be on the same tile.
1 : and then
1 : what else? any other advice?
1 : this one too?
3 : mm, let me see.
3 : that was
3 : now see that was just two
1 : yeah but as the engineer can do
2 : yeah
1 : two
3 : and that was
1 : as one
3 : two
2 : oh so you had extra.
1 : so i have one more like
1 : move
2 : ah ok
3 : ok
3 : huh
1 : so i might as well right?
3 : ok
1 : ok and now i get what two treasures?
3 : right here
1 : yeah can you just give me two?
1 : ok so i have
1 : one of these so this has to go
1 : up and then i
1 : take two
2 : hold on
1 : of these
1 : oh we have to shuffle these first and put them on top.
2 : 
1 : ok
1 : lost lagoon and gold gate
1 : oh this is sunk now.
1 : and there's lost lagoon.
3 : this
1 : and that's sunk too
1 : ok and this goes in the discard
1 : and then do i have to draw two more flood cards?
1 : i guess so
1 : phantom rock and cliffs of abandon
2 : hmm
2 : what?
1 : so i don't have to do that even though i already got that card? ok cool.
2 : yeah
1 : so this stays
1 : like that
1 : ok now your turn
2 : ok we already moved that up, that's all
1 : yeah
2 : alright
2 : where's my piece?
2 : what am i trying to go for?
2 : does anyone know how we actually
2 : capture
2 : the
1 : the treasure?
2 : the treasure again?
1 : you have to have all four of these cards.
2 : and then be on that?
1 : and then and then be on one of them yeah
3 : you have to be on the corresponding
2 : ok
2 : so how is this
2 : we move that in this direction
2 : shore up, there's nothing really to shore up.
2 : there's give a treasure card
1 : you don't, you don't have to do all three.
2 : capture a treasure
2 : i'll just
2 : move here and then
2 : umm
2 : 
2 : and umm i guess, what should we do
2 : draw two treasure cards in the deck.
2 : then
2 : i can
2 : 
2 : draw flood cards equal to the water level
2 : so two
2 :  draw the flood cards.
2 : cliffs of abandon and phantom rock
2 : this one
2 : and that one
3 : you said the cliffs?
2 : yes
2 : umm
2 : is that it?
1 : i think you're good
2 : and
2 :  we don't have to move this.
3 : no
1 : yeah
1 : yeah i think we're good
2 : 
3 : it's my turn.
3 : i'll stick here.
3 : two
3 : and
3 : where's breaker's bridge?
2 : breaker's bridge
1 : here it is.
1 : hmm
1 : now
1 : shore up these two
1 : and then
1 : move
1 : here
1 : and
1 : and then
1 : i guess
1 : take
1 : like
1 : yeah two
3 : w
1 : what you have an idea?
3 : wait do you
3 : do you have two or three turns?
3 : was that your
1 : three, i have one more
3 : i would
3 : because
3 : cause we i have
3 : one of, cause you have two of those and i have one
1 : mmhmm
3 : just in case you get the fourth one i would suggest moving closer to there.
1 : ok which one, this one or this one?
3 : i would go
3 : right here
1 : ok
1 : alright now i'll take two
1 : oh
1 : smart
2 : 
2 : we can only have five at any given time.
1 : yeah so i'm good cause this doesn't count as one.
2 : ok
1 : ok now two of these
1 : ah temple of the moon and iron gate.
2 : ok
2 : before 
2 :  time 
2 : does not count as an action to discard
2 : should i shore up something right now? it doesn't hurt to not have an extra card in my hand.
2 : i don't want to draw before, i don't want to be over five at any point so.
3 : mm
2 : i will probably while it's
2 : still your turn umm use my shore to
2 : would it be advisable to shore up? umm
3 : we have more of these so
2 : what should we go for?
3 : keep that one.
3 : shore up the howling garden.
2 : alright, shore up howling garden.
3 : it's over here
2 : uh ok
2 : alright now
2 : i could take up to three actions.
2 : i should probably
3 : unless you
2 : mm
2 : move yourself up
2 : i will i will move myself up, undo this one
3 : yeah
2 : ok i guess
2 : that counts as another action one
2 : two
2 : and i guess i can, can i move myself again?
1 : yeah cause you still have a third one.
2 : ok
2 : so i would
2 : then move myself back down to ah
2 : umm i should probably make my way to one of you two cause i can transfer one of your guys's
2 : umm i can transfer the either you two can meet
2 : and
2 : you know do a swap. swap for a swap actually that'd probably be advisable
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then
2 : you know
2 : plan on doing something else from there.
3 : ok
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : umm
1 : 
2 : did i draw two treasure cards already?
1 : no you still have to do that.
3 : yeah well
3 : yeah i think cause we're closer to the cave of embers where we need.
3 : so
2 : ok
2 : that's good so you guys can meet.
2 : alright so sorry i have to
2 : it's gonna have to raise the water level.
1 : so you have to shuffle these.
2 : ok
1 : now you draw three.
2 : one
2 : two
2 : three
2 : so breaker's bridge
2 : cliffs of abandonment
2 : and phantom rock
3 : bye, bye phantom
1 : so that
2 : wow
1 : card has to go too
2 : should i put that over there?
2 : thank you
3 : yeah
1 : i think that's it
2 : that's it
3 : ok
3 : mm
3 : i'm going to
3 : which one, which color
3 : are you again?
1 : red
3 : ok
3 : i'm gonna move
3 : here
3 : you're red ok
3 : one
3 : two and then if we're on the same tile just give you this
1 : yeah and then i think i have to get rid of one.
1 : so i guess i'll get rid of this one.
2 : yeah
1 : since we have
3 : yeah
1 : more of the yellow people.
1 : ugh
1 : ok so now is my turn
1 : so i'll trade in these. oh wait sorry you have to draw your two treasure.
3 : oh right
2 : and do the whole flood thing
3 : ok
3 : ok
1 : and then
1 : the two flood cards too
3 : oh three
1 : oh three right?
3 : ok
3 : ok gotta say good-bye to iron gate
3 : uh whispering garden
3 : whispering garden
3 : and then temple of the moon
1 : ok it's my turn
1 : ok
1 : can i do like can i shore up one that's like adjacent to one that's already
3 : oh
2 : oh
1 : oh
1 : can i
1 : like
1 : since this is adjacent to this?
1 : shore up both of them or does it have to be to me?
2 : umm you probably can only do one block over.
1 : you see what i'm saying?
1 : ok
1 : ok so i'll do
1 : one and then i'll move here.
2 : shore up or
1 : and then i'll do the four of these
2 : before you move before we
2 : can we go back? before you move can you trade right?
1 : yeah
2 : oh
2 : yeah that probably would be best. i was gonna say
1 : i was gonna shore up, move and then trade in these four.
2 : yeah  cliffs of abandon.
2 : umm
2 : it might be better.
2 : if we
2 : umm
2 : tra gave her
2 : actually yeah you're right you don't want to give her then she does that automatically discard.
2 : alright you could always just do it later you're right. i'm sorry
1 : no, no you're fine.
2 : continue
1 : ok so we'll leave that one shored up.
2 : continue
1 : and then
2 : alright
2 : did you want to do this one?
1 : well then it would be
2 : oh yeah you shored it up.
1 : ok so i'll move there and then
1 : if i trade in these
1 : four
1 : then i get
1 : this
1 : creature
3 : creature
1 : ok and then i get two treasure
1 : ok
1 : and then three floods
1 : so
1 : copper gate
3 : copper gate
1 : oh this one.
1 : crimson forest
1 : and howling garden.
1 : now it's your turn.
2 : now it's my turn so i can take up to three actions, i probably should do some unflooding.
2 : umm
2 : is crimson forest really needed anymore? i don't think it's really ever, it's even needed.
2 : so first i'm, should i unshore what i'm on?
3 : ok
3 : ok
3 : one
3 : ah
3 : cause we have all four here now
3 : and you're close
3 : where are you?
3 : right here?
2 : yeah
3 : so y ou're closest to temple of the moon
2 : hmm
3 : so
2 : i should probably start collecting these as well
3 : start collecting those
3 : and then make your way towards temple of the moon
3 : trying to figure that out
2 : yeah
2 : are there are any other umm
2 : you don't want to lose a-uh
2 : a rock place i guess
2 : so
3 : ok
2 : is there, is this a rock place?
1 : no so there's temple of the moon and temple of the sun
2 : oh no
2 : oh ok as long as we protect like those two.
2 : so should i
3 : so i mean if anything floods i have two lift cards if we need to
3 : i think that's how it works
1 : yeah you can swim away
3 : yeah
1 : well if you're on the tile right?
3 : if you're on it. we only have if i'm on the tile.
2 : i can't give that in yet
2 : so
2 : first
2 : should i
2 : i'm gonna unshore this?
2 : i should.
2 :  this
3 : unshore that
3 : and then
2 : ok
2 : so one action
2 : draw
2 : second action should be
2 : probably move over here.
2 : second
1 : well
1 : you don't want to get too far from us cause if we're gonna trade these cards to you we have to be on the same tile as you.
2 : ah
3 : mmhmm
1 : so you could like
1 : shore up this one and then move to her tile
2 : i have two actions but what do you want to start collecting next and what should she start collecting next?
2 : maybe
2 : umm i should
2 : take your guys's rocks from you i guess?
2 : and then
3 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : take your guys's rocks from you
2 : and then if you can possibly move me over to this really soon?
2 : or one of these and i can then
3 : yeah
2 : take that piece.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : which treasure have we decided to give up?
3 : did we?
3 : we decide, we're not going to need the chalice cause we already discarded one chalice card.
2 : ok
3 : so if you have more
3 : then you can just get rid of the chalice and we'll still have
3 : this
3 : and that to take care of
3 : cause we already have one
2 : ok
2 : so should i shh
2 : so instead i should move towards you guys and then
3 : yeah and then pass
1 : because you can give us cards without being on the same tile as us but we have to be on the same tile as you to give you cards.
2 : yeah
2 : definitely
3 : and then we can lift towards the temple if it doesn't sink.
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : or can't you lift people too?
3 : that's it.
3 : yeah i
3 : i can lift people. let me see
3 : can i lift people?
3 : well
2 : can what's the pilot?
2 : the pilot can move.
3 : well i can
3 : move myself.
3 : that's it.
2 : is this your ability thing?
2 : once per turn fly
2 : to yeah
3 : i can go to any tile.
1 : ok
3 : but
2 : you can go to any tile.
3 : we do have a problem
3 : if temple of the moon sinks we only have temple of
2 : we have this one.
3 : ok but
3 : i guess i can
3 : i can
3 : if i get, if you can give me
3 : the other two if we meet up then i can fly towards temple of the sun and get this
3 : that's
1 : so how many moves do you have left?
2 : oh i have two
2 : so
3 : you have two
2 : but yours are these two remember you can only have the five cards so
3 : oh wait ah shoot yeah
2 : these are very important. so probably while it's my turn i would recommend
2 : sandbags
2 : aren't probably something you should probably just hold on to anyways if you can
3 : yeah
2 : so
2 : maybe
3 : ok
1 : well also we
2 : you can only have up to five at one time so you can't continue to have too many cards.
1 : we're
1 : both these two are in danger of being sunk too and we have, we still have to get that one.
2 : oh definitely
3 : ah cr yeah that's true
2 : so while it's still my turn and since you can use this at any time it would probably be best to
2 : u se it right now, instead of waiting till your turn.
3 : ok
3 : what do you want me to shore up? temple of the moon?
3 : or
3 : or one of
1 : i would do one of these cause if we draw like these two then we're done.
2 : yeah
3 : ok i think we're closest to that one ok
2 : i thought
2 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : and then you can move
1 : here
1 : so that on her turn she can no
1 : it would make more sense for her to move to you
2 : so should we all should we focus our
2 : our
2 : should we migrate south i should say ok.
1 : migrate downward
2 : i have two moves, so
2 : umm
2 : can how about we give you the
2 : the you will head for the howling
1 : ok
2 : howling gardens
2 : so
2 : since i have
2 : two
2 : i should probably well i gotta meet with you guys anyways
2 : so
1 : you could like shore up this while you're here and then move there or something
2 : i'm gonna at least
3 : mm
2 : well since we don't need crimson forest anymore since we already have it and temple and we're already just trying to save this one
1 : oh ok yeah
1 : ok
2 : you might as well just like
3 : yeah
1 : keep going down
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : so
2 : who should i
2 : i don't really have
1 : i mean you don't have to take both of them you can do just one too
2 : two
2 : ok
2 : yeah
2 : that's true
2 : go
2 : that's my second move
2 : and then
2 : trade
2 : oh wait a minute you guys have to give me the card huh?
1 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
2 : should i, should i move again?
1 : you can
1 : you might as well just
3 : as, as i, as i said if you have, cause we're not going to need this anymore.
2 : oh 
3 : so if
3 : umm
1 : if you want to draw your two treasures
2 : yeah ok
3 : yeah
2 : oh no another water rise, and not a good card
2 : so would you mind did you move it up one?
1 : yes
2 : thank you
1 : oh these have to be shuffled.
2 : alright, well
2 : 
1 : then you draw three.
2 : one
2 : two
2 : three
3 : yep
3 : see
2 : so crimson forest
2 : bye bye
2 : ah howling garden
3 : ok
2 : and
2 : temple of the moon
1 : temple of the moon
3 : yep
2 : alright we're
2 : we're invested now in this
3 : i told you this was
3 : just ok
2 : 
3 : so
3 : oh it's my turn
3 : ok
3 : i'm trying to think of what i should do
2 : probably
2 : it'd be best to give me
1 : give him the
2 : give me one
1 : thing, yeah
3 : ok
1 : then you have to discard something
2 : i have to discard one
3 : discard the chalice
2 : alright
1 : we also don't need this one
1 : because we alreadxy got it all of them.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah ok umm
2 : well let's just discard the crimson just to be on the safe, safe, safe side.
1 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : in case like you know something
3 : ok
2 : really bad happens
3 : and then
3 : ok
3 : i can move anywhere so i can move to
3 : this
3 : i can move the temple and then use the lift to take you guys.
2 : oh actually
2 : mmhmm
1 : i would move to like one of these and then sink that one or move there and save it
3 : move here?
3 : this?
1 : and then
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : and that would be three moves right?
2 : ok
3 : oh
3 : is that three?
1 : yeah cause you gave and then you moved and then you
3 : ok
3 : ok that makes sense
3 : oh i got another lift low and behold
2 : ah
2 : that's good
3 : alright and then draw three flood cards was it?
1 : yeah
3 : don't forget that.
1 : no you only do that on water's rises
3 : oh ok
3 : ok
3 : copper gate
3 : uh cliffs of abandon
3 : and breaker's bridge
2 : bye breaker's
3 : adios muchacho
1 : ok
1 : now
1 : i'm gonna move
1 : here and give you
1 : this
2 : ok
2 : that's good so i discard
3 : yeah
3 : just discard the chalice
2 : what?
1 : and then advice for what to do next
2 : mm
2 : can i give you
2 : oh should we give
3 : well i ca
2 : the griffin's too. maybe you should give me the griffins
3 : yeah it's set
2 : oh no i can only yeah that would probably be a bad idea anyways
3 : i was gonna s
1 : well once you trade those in
3 : umm it says i can play this at any time
2 : ok
3 : so
3 : if you want
2 : umm what we can do, we can play these at any time?
3 : play this at any time. i have so many lift cards.
2 : ok
2 : this is good because i guess when it becomes my turn i'll be able to
3 : yeah
2 : give
3 : yeah cause i'm already here at howling garden
2 : who should i give
3 : that's where you can collect this
2 : ok
3 : i have three of these
2 : who should we
2 : give the griffin's to?
3 : mm
1 : probably you cause you already have two.
3 : yeah give the give the griffins to me and i can fly you guys over here so you can collect well
2 : 
2 : so should
2 : so
3 : umm
3 : i can move you towards temple of the sun where you can just give to
2 : that would probbaly be best
3 : ok
2 : 
3 : so i'll use this and
1 : well he can't do that until his turn. he can't trade in those four cards.
3 : ah it's not your turn?
2 : that's not yeah
1 : no it's mine, i have two moves left.
3 : ok
1 : no
3 : i mean you don't
1 : one
1 : cause i moved and then i gave him a card so i have one move left
2 : might as well shore up something i guess?
3 : ok
1 : yeah just
2 : 
1 : this one?
3 : yeah
2 : yeah maybe
1 : well i can do two so i can do these two
2 : well there's, well there's not point, well yeah yeah, ok, yeah
1 : i mean, might as well it gives us more
3 : just in
2 : doesn't hurt yeah
1 : more space
3 : i guess just in case ok
1 : ok
1 : and then i get two treasures please.
3 : 
1 : ok
1 : and three floods
1 : two
1 : ok
1 : umm silver gate
1 : cave of embers
1 : and whispering garden oh this is gone
3 : yup
3 : ok
1 : ok
1 : and now it's your turn
2 : ok so for my turn it would probably be best to just fly me somewhere really quick
3 : fly you here?
2 : ok
2 : so for my first action
2 : i will
1 : these go in the discard
2 : and then
2 : that's one action then who should i
2 : who should
2 : the
2 : griffin go to
3 : well i'm already here yeah
2 : you're already on the griffins
1 : i guess just take two
1 : well you, you're the messenger so you can give, you don't have to be on the same tile, you can just give
2 : yeah
1 : you might as well just give it to her
3 : yeah you don't, you don't have to be on the same tile as me.
2 : so we have
2 : we have two
1 : so i would say just
3 : cause i have
3 : yeah
1 : sorry go ahead.
3 : cause i have, cause i have the most.
1 : yeah so i would say give that to her and then start making your way here cause we all have to end up here.
2 : mmhmm
1 : don't leave.
3 : and we got twelve minutes.
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : so
2 : so
2 : give that to you
3 : so give it to me
1 : and then i would say just like
1 : start
1 : use your third action to just start heading back
2 : just start heading on, heading on back
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : draw two
2 : umm
2 : and next one's the flood.
2 : draw floods
2 : equal to the level
2 :  one, two, three
3 : don't forget the shuffle
1 : no you only do that on waters rises.
2 : oh that's right
3 : ah
2 : one
2 : two
2 : three
2 : so bronze gate
3 : bronze gate
2 : coral palace
1 : ok
2 : and dunes of deception
3 : ok
3 : ah
3 : ok
3 : i'm going to
3 : go right here
3 : i guess
2 : mm why don't
2 : you really
2 : how should i put this, you have five cards already
3 : yeah
2 : and you're gonna draw some really soon right?
3 : yeah
2 : so
2 : we need at least one lift
2 : to, to get us out of here
3 : ok
2 : so if we should probably use the lift since this is going to be her turn next
3 : yeah
2 : to
1 : fly me to her
2 : fly you to her
3 : yeah ok
3 : that
1 : i mean you don't have to take any actions too.
2 : but now that, now that she at you though can you guys, oh yeah she's got to give it
3 : yeah
1 : i have to wait until it's my turn
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : so like you might as well just
1 : since we're there just draw your two treasures and
3 : ok
3 : ok
3 : and
3 : i'm not gonna need that.
3 : and then do i have to get flood cards?
1 : yeah three
3 : ok misty marsh
3 : temple of the sun
3 : and tidal palace is right here.
2 : oh, sorry
1 : ok so
1 : i will give you this
3 : and i'll discard that
1 : and then
1 : i'm going to go
1 : umm ok so we'll have all
1 : four so on your turn you can trade them in and then fly us out.
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : should i try and just like save some things?
2 : we sho probably, we should all start heading to fool
1 : yeah
2 : fool's landing.
3 : yeah we can just
2 : she can get there at any time using the pilot so
1 : so i'll go here and then here?
3 : yeah
2 : yeah that makes sense.
