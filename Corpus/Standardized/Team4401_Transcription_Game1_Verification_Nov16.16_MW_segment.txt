2 : ok
1 : ok i start
1 : and
1 : i'm gonna shore up whispering garden
1 : and
1 : cliffs of abandon.
2 : wait, you have to be adjacent to it right?
1 : oh wait, i have to be next to it, yeah.
2 : yeah, cause you could do two, but they still have to be next to you.
1 : ok, i'll do the lost lagoon
1 : and
1 : i'll move
1 : one place over
1 : and
1 : umm
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : p
1 : this place.
1 : ok
1 : i think that was three actions.
1 : so now draw two treasure deck cards.
2 : yeah
1 : thank you
1 : oh man,
1 : got a water's rise card
1 : so
1 : it went to two.
1 : so i
1 : discard that,
1 : and
3 : and then i think you gotta shuffle
2 : no
2 : umm
1 : oh
3 : those
2 : oh, oh
1 : these should probably
1 : not even be here though, if we just started,
1 : so
1 : i'll just
2 : or did you guys put those there? ok
1 : oh ok, they're meant to be there
3 : ok
2 : ok so we gotta shuffle and put those on top.
1 : shuffle them
1 : oops
2 : ok
1 : and pick two
1 : so cliffs of abandon and lost lagoon.
1 : oh no!
2 : oh no!
1 : already!
2 : oh
1 : ok
1 : here we go
2 : mm
2 : what cards what treasure cards do you have?
2 : ok
2 : wait how did you get three?
1 : two fire and
1 : umm cause i just
2 : oh
2 : yeah
1 : picked, ok
2 : duh
2 : ok
2 : so
1 : ocean's
2 : what am i gonna do, i don't
2 : umm
2 : i don't know i can't really do anything useful, so i guess i'll just move.
2 : so
2 : cool
2 : and then
2 : flood cards
2 : whispering garden and phantom rock
1 : oh you have to shuffle this one don't you?
2 : no that's only whenever you draw a water's rise card right?
3 : yeah
1 : oh, ok
2 : oh no we lost phantom rock!
1 : no
1 : oh no
2 : ok
3 : alright
3 : umm
3 : hmm
3 : shh
3 : i don't really know what i should do
2 : do you guys maybe wanna pick one treasure and just sorta like aim for it?
2 : or do you think it'd be better
2 : cause i mean like we got two
1 : s
1 : two, two, two
3 : yeah
1 : so we have to get three of four let's just stick with maybe these three for now, but
1 : then again like, he could always
3 : ok
2 : why don't we try and focus on the next treasure that we get the third card for, how does that sound?
3 : yeah
3 : alright well
2 : cause we need four right?
1 : ok
3 : i'm gonna fly over here,
3 : and then shore up whispering garden cause it might
1 : mm
3 : we might draw that again and lose it.
2 : good idea
1 : good call
3 : and then
3 : umm
2 : so was that that was two moves?
1 : mm
3 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : and then
3 : i guess i'll just shore up lost lagoon as the third one
2 : can you do that diagonally though?
1 : it's he's right here.
3 : i'm blue, yeah
2 : oh, duh, yeah you're blue.
3 : and then, so i draw
3 : two of these
2 : you're red, you're blue, ok.
3 : ok, helicopter lift,
3 : and fire.
1 : nice
2 : cool
3 : and then
3 : draw two flood cards,
3 : so i got golden gate,
3 : and breaker's bridge.
1 : you're on breaker's bridge
3 : oh
2 : don't break the bridge
1 : put your swimming trunks on
2 : so that one
1 : ok
1 : so i'm definitely gonna
1 : shore up this guy
1 : and
1 : ok, umm
3 : i think you have to be on the same tile if you wanna like trade cards with someone.
1 : right, unless you're the messenger.
1 : umm
2 : you could,
2 : you could move onto his tile and then trade him the card, would that cause you have two actions left.
3 : yeah if you give em to me
1 : oh, that's true
3 : then i have the bonus of being able to fly wherever.
1 : can i give you two cards though?
2 : but can you
3 : i wanted to like
2 : can you give two cards or is the other way
3 : uh,
3 : give a single card. i guess in
3 : each card is an action
2 : we can wait until his turn and you could
1 : ok, you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna,
3 : i think
1 : i'm gonna
1 : take another turn and go here.
1 : ok, two treasure
3 : cool
1 : can you get me two treasure cards?
1 : thank you.
1 : alright
1 : and i have five now.
1 : and
1 : i need two
1 : so ok
1 : temple of the moon and iron gate
1 : are now flooded.
2 : ok
2 : yeah, ok
2 : umm
2 : k so i can give my cards to anyone but i can't but i can only take them from people i'm standing on the same tile as.
2 : umm
1 : umm 
2 : does your, does your ability count as a turn? because i could do one,
2 : two, switch with him for a third action, then use my ability to give it to her.
2 : can i do that?
1 : wait what?
2 : does using your ability count as an action?
3 : mm
3 : mm,
1 : i don't think so
3 : yeah, i don't think
1 : no
2 : so i could do
2 : one move
2 : no, you're red.
2 : dammit, ugh
1 : but i am on the ocean chalice, so if you gave that to me, that would
3 : mmhmm
1 : like
1 : raise our chances, umm
2 : yeah
2 : yeah, i was just thinking for the red one, but
1 : but we only have two
2 : ok
1 : the red one.
2 : yeah, cause
1 : the fire,
1 : the fire chalice
2 : yeah, cause if he can give that to you, then we can
2 : yeah cause, you could move here.
1 : a single card
2 : can you give
2 : oh, per action, ok so it does count as an action.
3 : ok
1 : oh
2 : ok
2 : my mistake.
2 : umm,
2 : you've already got five cards though, you have to discard one.
1 : mmhmm
2 : you could discard the lion though, so you could have two of these.
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
2 : i mean does that sound good?
1 : sure
2 : alright
2 : so one,
2 : two, and then, here,
2 : three.
1 : discard this please
2 : oh, and then
2 : draw f
1 : did you pick treasure cards?
2 : i did not.
1 : ok
2 : ah no!
1 : mm
2 : shuffle
2 : ok,
2 : and then draw
2 : three
2 : i think we already lost breaker's bridge, didn't we?
2 : no, you're on it right now.
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok so we lost iron gate,
3 : oh yeah
2 : breaker's bridge
2 : gets flooded
1 : oh no temple of the moon
2 : and
1 : right here.
2 : ok so we need
2 : everybody try and
3 : 
2 : keep temple of the sun, we need that one.
1 : right,
3 : ok
1 : that's our last earth chalice
1 : or whatever
3 : alright,
3 : umm
3 : i guess i will
3 : fly over here, hang out with you guys,
1 : party!
3 : and flip this over,
3 : and also
3 : give you my fire treasure card, and then your turn you can just like move over to the cave of shadows and
1 : mmhmm
2 : you have to discard one now too though.
1 : ok
3 : and then, so i draw two treasures
3 : do do do
1 : no that's green.
3 : earth and sandbags
2 : sweet
1 : nice
3 : now i have five
3 : and
3 : ok.
1 : and now flood cards equal to the water level.
3 : cool
1 : 
3 : it says three?
2 : mm
1 : mm
3 : one
3 : lost lagoon, whispering garden, and
1 : not quite
3 : howling garden.
1 : not lost.
2 : howling garden,
2 : whispering garden, what was the third one?
1 : ok, both gardens are
3 : lost lagoon
2 : ok
1 : oh man
1 : alright
2 : so you have four you can move here and get the, the red one.
1 : right
3 : yeah, i would recommend like flipping that over first.
1 : and then moving back
1 : i, i have three actions so
3 : yeah
1 : i wonder
1 : if taking this counts as an action. are you re are you done?
2 : yeah
2 : capture a treasure if you discard, that's, that's one action.
3 : oh yeah
1 : put that here
2 : so you could,
2 : you could move for your first action,
3 : 
2 : get the treasure card for your second one,
1 : ok,
1 : so
1 : discard these?
1 : got one
2 : yay!
1 : and then,
1 : so that's one action.
2 : no that's two.
1 : that was two?
2 : cause you had to, you had to move first right?
3 : oh man
1 : and then taking this was an action
2 : yeah, number four.
1 : oh
3 : oh
2 : so, for my next turn i could
2 : use my three actions to move, move and then shore up.
3 : yeah
1 : i'm gonna move here.
1 : well,
1 : let me think.
1 : i'm gonna move here.
3 : ok
1 : for my last action, and then
2 : yeah, cause oh you can shore, you can shore up a
1 : two treasure cards.
2 : you can shore up card
2 : tiles you're adjacent to, i forgot about that. so you could
2 : do howling garden if you want.
1 : mm
1 : k
1 : copper gate,
1 : crimson forest,
1 : umm,
1 : and
1 : cave of embers.
1 : oh my gosh.
2 : we can lose cave of embers if we need to though, cause we already have that one.
3 : yeah we do have that treasure.
1 : yeah we should like focus on like these four, since they're close by each other
3 : yeah
1 : does that make sense?
2 : mmhmm
1 : cause these three are like
3 : well if you stay there, you're perfect, cause you can shore up diagonally.
1 : right
1 : cool
2 : wait, you can shore up diagonally?
2 : 
1 : no, no
3 : oh
1 : nope
3 : no she can't, ok.
1 : yeah
2 : no she can, she can just do two.
3 : just a ,
2 : just in the same direction, but she can just do two.
3 : ok
3 : oh that's the explorer, ok.
1 : mmhmm
2 : we don't have one of those.
1 : k, you're turn messenger.
3 : yeah
2 : yes
3 : alright
2 : so, yeah i'm right here.
3 : i would try to get like that flipped up.
2 : so
2 : you know what, i'm gonna do
3 : shore it up
2 : yeah,
2 : so one,
2 : two,
2 : and i can shore up this one no, i don't really need to though.
3 : yeah it's kinda just hanging out on the edge.
1 : right, we're good.
1 : yeah
2 : i mean, i could, i have one more turn left. might as well.
3 : yeah
2 : can't really use it for anything else.
3 : unless you wanted to like move somewhere
2 : umm
3 : or start moving somewhere.
1 : right, if you want,
2 : yeah, wait, where do you think i should move?
3 : umm,
1 : uh,
1 : umm,
2 : mm oh i could maybe head for here so we have someone on that one.
1 : what about this one?
2 : true.
2 : hmm
1 : maybe you should go here so that he's on the same tile as you so if he wants to give you a card, cause he has t he earth card, he could give that to you if you're on the same tile.
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, yeah, sounds good.
1 : k
3 : cool
2 : three
2 : oh, and then
2 : draw two
2 : ca ah
2 : umm
2 : move it up
1 : it's still on three though?
2 : yeah
1 : k
2 : shuffle,
2 : shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.
2 : put it on top, discard
2 : yeah, and
2 : one,two, three, four, five,
2 : ok.
1 : did you
1 : pick these yet? ok
2 : no, not,
2 : not yet.
2 : umm, yeah
1 : three
2 : two
2 : ok, so, crimson forest,
3 : gone
1 : outta there.
2 : gone
2 : lost lagoon,
1 : right here, we lost it.
2 : gone.
2 : and
2 : breaker's bridge.
1 : ok, cool.
3 : ok
3 : let's think.
2 : do you maybe wanna give me your purple thing?
1 : so remember
3 : yeah
1 : the earth
2 : i can discard that
3 : i'll give you that
1 : earth
2 : cool, so that's one
3 : and umm
1 : mmhmm
3 : i, also
3 : could
3 : fly us
3 : to
3 : her, if i wanted to. i have two helicopter lifts.
2 : mm, if you
3 : and then you could she,
2 : yeah, if you wanna fly us to there, then on her turn she can give me one and then on my turn i can hop over to the temple of the sun and then get that one.
1 : hmm
3 : she could give you
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : i should probably shore up breaker's
3 : bridge too.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah, well you got three turns so you could shore it up
2 : and then fly us there and then for your third turn give
2 : no that was me, never mind.
3 : ok
1 : and then for your third turn, just
3 : yeah
2 : shore up howling garden maybe?
1 : yeah, shore up howling garden.
1 : yeah,
3 : yeah
1 : that seems perfect.
3 : oh this doesn't count as an action either, so that's cool.
1 : oh, because you are the pilot?
2 : no, because its a special it says on the card does not count as an action.
1 : oh, special action
3 : yeah
1 : oh
3 : oh and i can also shore up any tile i want to on the island, so
2 : oh, we forgot about that.
3 : should i like
3 : shh
1 : any island or?
3 : yeah, just any, any tile. should i do like howling garden, or
1 : the one
2 : mm
1 : mmhmm, definitely.
2 : either that or breaker's bridge, cause
1 : i mean, howling garden is more valuable though, because it has the treasure.
2 : it is
3 : yeah
3 : i'm next to that too, so i could just shore that up anyway, so
2 : yeah
1 : exactly.
2 : that's true.
3 : i'll play sandbags
3 : and shore up that
3 : and
3 : so, i still have two actions left so i'm gonna shore this up.
1 : mmhmm
2 : that's two.
3 : umm
3 : and then i use this card, i guess
3 : and fly us over here.
2 : cool
3 : and umm
1 : yeah
3 : then i guess i'll just
2 : you don't have to do a third thing
1 : yeah, you, yeah i feel like it would just be
3 : uh ok, yeah that's cool, i'll just
2 : cool
1 : cool
1 : and then
3 : my turn, draw two of these
1 : mmhmm
3 : got a winds, another helicopter lift, and i draw three of these, right?
2 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : two,
3 : three.
3 : alright,
3 : whispering garden and howling garden,
2 : oh good thing you shored that up
3 : yeah
1 : they seem to be going together a lot
3 : and then, copper gate is gone
1 : k
1 : my turn.
1 : i'm going to
1 : give you this,
1 : shore up howling garden,
1 : and
1 : gonna just
1 : stay where i am.
1 : so
1 : two treasure cards.
1 : oh my god, nice.
3 : oh right on
2 : yes!

2 : discard four.
2 : yeah!
2 : yes! i got the purple thing
2 : alright
2 : excellent
2 : oh,

2 : and
2 : bronze gate.
1 : ok
3 : ok,
3 : cool.

3 : uh
3 : yeah, i was gonna get that
1 : trying to shore that up.
2 : yeah
3 : so, i'll move here,
1 : mmhmm
3 : flip this
3 : over,
1 : mmhmm
3 : and umm
3 : i'm gonna use one of my helicopter lifts to fly you there so you can
3 : uh
1 : that's
3 : get the treasure.
1 : i
1 : i'm red.
3 : oh you're red? sorry

1 : wait a second, so this is my second action
2 : can you,
2 : can you, can you shore up the one i'm on?
1 : and this is my third action. yeah
1 : cause i can do two at once, if i'm next to them.

3 : if you
3 : oh umm,
3 : i was just gonna say if you guys are both on the same
3 : tile
3 : then on my turn i can use my helicopter lift,
3 : fly you both to fool's landing, and then move myself there and then she can use her lift to get us out of there.
1 : and then we won.
2 : oh, good idea, good idea, so i'm just gonna do that.
1 : cool
1 : mm
