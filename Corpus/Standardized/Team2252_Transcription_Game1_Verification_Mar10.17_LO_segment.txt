2 : yeah
2 : adjacent, you should do lost lagoon
3 : yeah.
1 : right ok.
1 : shore up those.
1 : so that's one action because i'm the engineer.
3 : yup
1 : and then because i have two of these i'm going to try and move closer
1 : to one of those
1 : so i move
1 : forward one.
1 : and then again i'm gonna
1 : use my one action to shore up these two.
1 : ok i draw can i have two treasure cards please?
2 : mmhmm, yes
1 : ok
1 : water's rise
1 : so from that play it immediately.
2 : move up one.
3 : i'm gonna shuffle those and put them on top.
1 : right.
1 : ok so
1 : two.
1 : phantom rock, s cliffs of abandon
1 : where's phantom rock?
3 : it's over here.
3 : so i'll take that card.
1 : ok.
2 : it's discarded.
1 : ok wait wait oh you want phantom rock
2 : one place in the discard
3 : oh yeah
1 : yeah i gave you the wrong one
2 : what is it right here.
1 : ok
1 : alright and then
3 : discard that in the treasure
2 : mmhmm.
1 : right
2 : alright my turn.
2 : you guys neither of you actually i'm going to give this card to the engineer for one action.
1 : nice
2 : and then i'm going to move
2 : to
2 : temple of the moon
2 : then i'm not allowed to shore up any one so
2 : draw two treasure cards
3 : you can't shore up?
1 : you could shore up this guy right here
3 : yeah you could shore up that adjacent one
2 : oh yeah i can oh yeah that's right.
1 : yeah
2 : adjacent 
2 : oh there we go cliffs of abandon's been shored up
3 : great.
2 : so draw two treasure cards
2 : sandbag and then this
2 : mm and, water rise goes up
3 : yup that one stays you just have to do two flood cards
1 : no that's only if you get a water's rise card
2 : no that's fine
2 : ok cool.
2 : and i have gold gate and lost lagoon
1 : this is one.
2 : so this one's pretty much gone.
2 : and put this on top of here.
2 : umm your turn.
1 : did you put
1 : did you move cards on top of here?
1 : where'd you put them over here?
2 : no
2 : right here
3 : yeah you just put them over there.
1 : ok alright just making sure.
2 : yeah
3 : alright so for my action
3 : oh man
3 : i'm gonna
3 : take
3 : i'm just gonna
3 : fly over here
3 : and then i'm gonna shore this up
2 : good idea.
3 : i'm gonna come back here, take my two treasure cards.
3 : helicopter lift and chalice
1 : and then you need two from here.
2 : you need two from here.
3 : right
3 : alright temple of the moon and
3 : breaker's bridge
2 : of course
1 : that's right next to it
1 : it's a good thing you shored that up
2 : here we go yeah
3 : alright.
4 : umm.
2 : explorer
4 : should i shore up one of those?
2 : you can move diagnonally.
4 : so that's one, shore this ok.
3 : yeah
3 : then you can actually shore up both of those
2 : sure yeah shore both of them
2 : two treasure cards
4 : thanks
4 : and then
4 : and then
1 : and then two flood cards
2 : then you have two floods cards
4 : so whispering gardens and iron gate
1 : this one
2 : flips over and flips over and i'll take this and put them back in the discard
4 : ok
1 : ok so what do we all have?
2 : fly
2 : i have two
2 : the air
1 : ok
2 : dragon things
3 : i'm thinking i can
3 : walk up to hers and give her this on my next turn
2 : i'm thinking that when i get here i can trade with her
1 : so we gotta trade before we get there right?
1 : ok.
3 :  let her get the these
4 : she i can only have one more so
3 : yeah cause you can only have five total
2 : yeah cause you can only have five or you'll have to discard a card
3 : right
3 : so hold on to those for now
2 : yeah i'm gonna hold on to these
1 : ok and then i can give you two
3 : yeah
4 : or
3 : we we'd have to be on the same tile to switch
1 : what if she
1 : right, right ok, so i can't switch with anyone
2 : yeah
2 : no
1 : so
3 : unless you wanted to come down to here.
1 : i can
2 : mmhmm.
3 : come down to me and give me a green one and i'll start stocking up on green and give her purple
1 : ok and she can give you the other green
3 : that work?
3 : that'll work yeah, it's a good idea.
1 : yeah alright so i'm red, so i'll move once and then move again
2 : there you go
1 : and then is there anything else i should really do?
3 : i'll take green
2 : you can't
1 : right
1 : ok.
1 : two treasure cards, probably should shore that up soon
2 : 
1 : yeah
3 : nn-eh
2 : op we got a water's rise card
3 : i can
1 : so i have this guy water's rise
2 : so it's going up one level so you need to draw three cards on top yep shuffle them and put them on top and then
1 : so we shuffle this first right?
2 : draw three
1 : ok.
2 : which ones?
1 : temple of the moon, lost lagoon
1 : cliffs abandon
2 : cliffs abandoned
1 : cliffs of abandon that one was ah
2 : i think that
1 : discarded wasn't it?
3 : no it's right here.
1 : no.
2 : yeah it's right here.
1 : that's the phantom one
2 : yeah
3 : alright
1 : ok so
2 : and place this right here.
1 : they go here
2 : and your turn is in alright, umm there's nobody really i can trade with. yeah, yeah
1 : i gotta discard this guy. that goes here?
2 : oh wait, no it goes over here
3 : yeah
2 : right here
1 : those go in the treasure one there you go
2 : so there's nothing i can really
2 : trade with so i'm going to move
1 : or do you want to shore up anything?
2 : yeah i'm going to shore up i can shore up two right? so
1 : yeah you can't do diagonal though only adjacent and what you're on
2 : ima
2 : yah that's what i figured so
2 : i'm going to move
2 : any recommendations?
3 : i mean if you stayed there you could shore up that one, shore up that one use your sandbags and get that one.
4 : well
2 : so stay here? and shore up cliffs of abandon?
3 : if you
3 : yeah
2 : ok that's a good  point
3 : cause we don't really need to save the lagoon or the gate.
2 : here
2 : no no i can shore up this one.
3 : the
3 : eh no
1 : no you can't you could do this one right?
2 : no you good
2 : you shore up oh ok.
3 : you can shore the one you're on.
2 : there we go and then i'll just
3 : and then if you use your sandbag's we can save that one since it's got a treasure on it
2 : alright and that gets me down one card though. we  that's gonna go on here and then whispering garden
2 : there we go.
2 : and now it's my turn to draw two.
2 : oh sweet. look at that.
2 : and we got another sandbag so that, and then draw two cards from here
1 : and three.
2 : that's three
2 : alright whispering garden, iron gate and breakers
2 : bridge
3 : i'll take iron gate.
2 : there you go and then i'm gonna place these two on top of here.
1 : ok.
3 : alright so i'm gonna get her
3 : purple
1 : we'll see
1 : you got you
3 : right here
2 : 
1 : ok
3 : so i think i'm gonna shore
3 : this one up first
3 : and then come up here and then give that to her.
2 : ok
3 : sound like a plan?
1 : yeah
2 : that sounds good
3 : alright
3 : yup so
3 : that's yours now.
1 : just two actions.
3 : that's three, cause i shored it and i moved and i gave it to her.
1 : that's ok
1 : ok cool.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : ok.
1 : so do you have five
3 : and that, yeah so i have to discard one of these.
1 : more?
1 : right.
2 : discard the fire one. name$$$ you can trade me eventually for one of these
3 : uh
3 : yeah
2 : does he hear us?
1 : well
2 : cause i'm gonna use when go have mine i'm gonna move, use sandbags and then i take that as my third action and then take that
3 : yeah that'll be better
1 : oh right cause we need four, right? ok.
2 : yeah and we have one of them.
3 : cool
2 : alright you have treasure cards?
3 : yeah i just need the

3 : a lot of gates
2 : she didn't even put that one in
3 : alright
2 : alright explorer
4 : alright so should i give you your
2 : move diagonally
3 : i'll take that green one.
4 : do you
4 : so ok so one and then do you want this one?
2 : 
2 : yeah
4 : if i move here?
2 : i think i can i can these don't count as

1 : you could
3 : well if i helicopter lift him
1 : hold on

2 : umm can s
1 : so where are you? you need to be on a lion's one so i can helicopter you.
2 : yeah i'm trying to think of which way i should move, maybe i can
2 : well i can't i can move down here and
2 : flip this over.
2 : that's one, is that a good idea?
