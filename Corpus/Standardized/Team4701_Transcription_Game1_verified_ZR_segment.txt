1 : ok
2 : alright
1 : if i move
1 : shore up whispering gardens
2 : yeah that's a good idea.
1 : good idea yeah. i'm gonna let these just go.
2 : yeah those are fine.
1 : umm any things that are on the shh on the perimeters
1 : umm and maybe
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : what do you think?
2 : i, i think so yeah because that would
3 : wouldn't you have
1 : yeah but yeah try to keep the land mass together as far as possible.
2 : yeah, yeah that's fine.
1 : ok so that's that, now what else do i have to do here?
3 : can you do you you have to move on and then shore it up.
1 : move myself to one of these. yeah.
2 : oh wait, wait.
1 : mmhmm
2 : it can only be umm
2 : it can only be adjacent cards. we have to leave breaker's bridge, bridge at the moment.
1 : what
3 : yeah well if she moves there and then shores it up, that's ok.
1 : oh ok adjacent ok
2 : ok
2 : ok
1 : uh huh
1 : well this is adjacent then right? i can move here and then i have to
3 : if you want
2 : yeah no not now it goes here.
3 : yes
1 : move myself here? is that it?
3 : that's
2 : mm
1 : or do i
3 : four turns so
3 : you can
1 : ok
3 : just stay on whispering.
1 : ok i can stay on whispering gardens, ok fine.
3 : yup
2 : all good.
3 : cause you did one, two, three.
1 : and then
1 : then i have to
2 : ah
2 : draw the treasure deck cards first and then the
1 : draw treasure deck card, ok
2 : the flood cards so here's
2 : one and two and then here's
1 :  ok.
2 : one and two
1 : chalice and
1 : water rise ok.
2 : uh oh
1 : ok so we have to 
2 : oh
1 : ok
1 : ok
1 : mm ok so we go up one and we're still in normal but it probably won't be for long probably, then this goes
1 : move the water level, shuffle the flood
1 : discard pile.
2 : that goes over to the
2 : discard
1 : ok fine
1 : uh huh
3 : and then you shuffle those two
2 : umm
2 : yeah
1 : shuffle these
3 : or no
3 : the ones in the discard
1 : oh
1 : i'm sorry ok
3 : and then you just put them on top.
1 : mm
1 : mm
1 : put
1 : what on top? oh
3 : umm
3 : those on top of the flood pile.
1 : oh ok.
2 : come on
1 : mmhmm
1 : mm
2 : there we go
1 : mm
1 : oh they go on this ok fine, yeah alright fine.
2 : yeah they go on top of there.
2 : alright so then
3 : ok
2 : equal equal to the water level which is three, or no sorry, two, two, two
3 : two
1 : it's two yeah
2 : ah so then take two yeah
1 : just take two of these ok
1 : cliffs of abandon and phantom rock
1 : ah hah
2 : umm
1 : cliffs of abandon, what do i do with this?
2 : well that's,that's sunk now.
1 : it's sunk oh that's right these are the sunk ones, so this, this is a mess.
1 : phantom rock
2 : yeah that's
2 : that's over there.
1 : is
2 : oh we gotta take this one too
1 : ok
1 : phantom rock is
2 : yeah
3 : oh thanks
2 : umm
2 : that falls yeah
1 : where's phantom rock?
2 : phantom rock is 
1 : ok that was gonna go too so actually that's ok this is a mess but this the perimeter i'm not so much worried about.
2 : ah it's on the edges. it's not the worst.
1 : so that goes
2 : up
2 : there.
3 : ok now it's your turn.
2 : alright
1 : mmhmm
1 : hmm
2 : here we go ok ah, wait  im sorry i'm over there.
2 : i will move, let's move to
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
3 : to here
1 : mm
2 : let's move to the misty marsh first
2 : let's also move to
2 : the copper
2 : gate
2 : and let's move
2 : let's go tidal palace
2 : ok treasure cards, what did i get?
2 : sandbags is helpful
2 : alright the earth, another earth stone
2 : ah any one else will be ok
2 : i think if like
2 : if we start to get
2 : more than one and especially if you, if you draw two of the same one
1 : yeah
2 : in addition to like if you drew a third
1 : mmhmm
2 : or
2 : you drew two more umm
3 : you're allowed to give them. are we allowed to give them?
2 : ah
2 : oh man i should umm
3 : oh yeah give it up to three actions, never mind we can
2 : ok umm
2 : yes like if you drew, if you drew
1 : one more
2 : umm
1 : crystal
1 : fire
2 : yeah, yeah but like, ok
3 : only if we're on the same tile you can do it without the same tile.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, like but umm, if you, if you get three, even if you get two
2 : sort of like
2 : i think it'd be good to like kind of
1 : concentrate on that and get that off the board?
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah like, like make that, make that
2 : piece
2 : yeah like make that like your goal and try to
1 : yeah yeah
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : umm it would put ourself around that ok.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm two treasure cards alright so it floods, floods at two.
3 : see you pick
2 : what i get?
2 : gold gate and whispering garden
2 : whispering garden is a little
1 : soggy
2 : a little soggy and gold gate
2 : is
2 : gone. well there's
2 : there's that.
2 : it happens to the best of us.
1 : mm
1 : mm
2 : alright so this one goes
2 : like on top.
1 : mmhmm
3 : so should i find myself over here to save this one?
2 : what?
2 : oh
2 : ok ok
1 : mmhmm
2 : oh what's that?
3 : so should i fly myself over there so umm we can save
3 : these?
2 : yes
3 : instead of getting sunk?
2 : yes save or fly yourself to
2 : umm
2 : i i would do
3 : oh i know i can fly anywhere so
2 : i would fly here maybe because
2 : you can shore up shore up that one, and shore up that one as well
2 : because
3 : ok good choice, ok. and then i'll shore this one up
2 : i just
2 : i
2 : ok
2 : and then
3 : and then i'll shore that one up and that's my three
2 : that would be up
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : let's get those treasure cards going.
3 : one, two
3 : ok
3 : and then two flood
3 : so
3 : breaker's bridge
3 : and
3 : umm lost lagoon
2 : lost lagoon
2 : well good call, we almost we almost lost it.
3 : ok
2 : not sure it would have been the biggest loss, but
2 : well
3 : right
3 : either way
2 : it's still not good though to lose islands, to lose tiles.
1 : mm
2 : part of the island
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : engineer i think it's your turn
1 : ok so umm
1 : two actually, oh i need it's cards i need not to be in proximity to
1 : the
2 : well if you just like
2 : if you see that
3 : right you have to if you want to do this you have to get you on this one or this one
1 : yeah
1 : oh ok fine so that's gonna be
2 : yeah
2 : nop it would be smart for her to get to your tile though so she could
2 : take that treasure card
2 : or like you could give to her
3 : give it to her yeah
2 : only if we're on the same tile though
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : mm i can move, i can move twice right?
2 : 
3 : so you
3 : you can go up to three so
1 : up to three ok
2 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : you can do like
3 : you could
2 : i don't know
2 : umm
3 : save this one
1 : 
1 : go to here?
2 : 
2 : yeah i would say save breaker's bridge
3 : so shore breaker's bridge
1 : ok shore this up. alright
3 : and then you could just move to that and stay. you don't have to do three.
1 : again
1 : uh huh
1 : ok that's fine ok
2 : yeah
1 : and now i have to draw cards.
2 : yeah two treasure and the water still at two thankfully.
1 : alright
1 : ok
1 : well i now have three
2 : awesome
3 : ok
1 : awesome so that's good. what we can't take that off right away, right? that's
2 : awesome
2 : no because she has the fourth one
3 : i have to, you have to wait until my turn
1 : you have the fourth one,ok fine.
2 : and then
3 : and then you do two
2 : and
1 : ok two of these ok
2 : yeah two, two of the island cards
1 : temple of the moon, which is where? temple of the moon is ns now somewhere. as i said i don't so much care for the perimeter. iron gate.
2 : that's
1 : oh
2 : oh right here.
1 : ok so again those are things that i'm not all that
1 : concern ah do those go here?
2 :  here here
3 : yeah they just go right on top.
2 :  pull like that
1 : ok good enough cool.
2 : alright
2 : my turn umm
2 : what am i gonna do.
2 : let's
2 : actually i'm gonna
2 : i'm gonna probably stay in this half of the board unless
1 : mmhmm
2 : something
2 : is in of honest need down here cause so i'm gonna go
2 : one
2 : two
2 : and shore this up cause i have two of these
2 : earth two earth stone cards
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm
2 : ok so then
3 : ok now we have
3 : well go ahead
2 : ok
2 : ah water's rise, lovely ok
2 : i have a
2 : and a fire
2 : or a statue of wind
2 : i gotta raise the water level to three now
1 : mm
2 : the water's rise goes here.
2 : and now i have
2 : i have five cards so
2 : the one i will discard will probably be the sand or
3 : you can have up to five right?
2 : yeah
2 : so like the one that i will discard will be
2 : the sandbag
2 : and ooh i'm going to do two actually
3 : well you can use that before you pull for the
2 : or
3 : water you can use your sandbag
2 : oh
1 : oh
2 : oh ok
2 : ok then
2 : can i use that
2 : now
2 : or or is that
3 : can shore up any one tile before it sinks but can't be used if the flood deck for sinking
3 : tile
1 : mm
3 : has already been drawn.
3 : so yeah use it before you pull from the flood.
2 : ok
2 : so then i will save
2 : the
3 : does it have to be?
2 : i think it could be anyone.
3 : yeah i think so.
1 : yeah
2 : ok let's say the lost lagoon
1 : mmhmm
1 : makes sense yeah
2 : alright so sandbags goes to
2 : where is this discarded? ok yeah
3 : i think that one and then you can pull now.
3 : mm
3 : oh shuffle
2 : ok
3 : and then replace sorry.
3 : and you already moved it up
2 : alright
1 : just getting us off the island and leaving the treasures i take it is not an option.
2 : ah if only, if only
1 : we ought like  screw this you're right.
3 : ok so
2 : ah alright
3 : i want to umm give mine but she already has
3 : alright the engineer has five
2 : well we have to try to  real quick.
3 : oh yeah
2 : lost lagoon again this can't
3 : ok
3 : good choice
2 : can't stay dry and temple of the moon. dissapointed because
2 : i don't wanna
1 : mm
3 : right
2 : i i  fly all the way down
2 : temple of the sun
2 : alright
2 : so these stay here.
1 : mmhmm
2 : go ahead pilot
3 : ok
3 : so since i'm on the same as
3 : engineer i want to give her
3 : the s
2 : ah i drew i drew these two
1 : right here
1 : but you need three, we're all in here yeah
3 : three corresponding to the thing
2 : three i'll
2 : got it, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha
2 : ok iron gate is gone but
1 : mm yeah
3 : mm ok
2 : not, not the biggest concern
3 : well yeah ok
3 : so
3 : since i'm on the same is it worth
3 : getting rid of her umm
3 : water chalice in order for me to
3 : cause she can't have, engineer can't have more than five cards.
2 : umm
1 : oh you mean this also counts so i now have
3 : no
1 : not two, no this doesn't
3 : well i'm on the same as you so i'd like to give you
2 : oh you have
1 : ok
1 : yeah, yeah ok
2 : i think
2 : i think that's a good idea because there's only
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok so i'm gonna give you this and you can discard this
2 : two
1 : so i
2 : yeah
2 : there's only two chalices, now there's only one on the that table and we have
1 : ok 
3 : and you have four right now so i'm going to
2 : three
1 : so we have this ok
2 : well i i don't think
2 : or we
3 : well
1 : well i have a total of five right?
2 : i will give you
2 : i will give you this card
2 : when it's my turn
3 : ok so that was one turn
2 : yeah
3 : and
3 : i can
3 : move
3 : both of us to some other place. so can't i move
3 : both of us to here and?
1 : yeah where?
3 : or no?
3 : to
2 : to maybe
2 : maybe
3 : where am i looking like here?
1 : 
1 : why are we trying to do that, which what are we looking? what's our goal right now?
3 : so you're set up so you can take that right away for my for your next turn.
2 : the crys crystal of fire
1 : yeah uh huh
2 : yeah, yeah that would be helpful
3 : so i'm gonna use this and then move
3 : both of us to right here
1 : ok
3 : so that's my second turn
3 : and then
3 : i guess my
3 : well where was i before? no i'm fine.
2 : you were we
2 : you guys were both on the whispering garden i think
1 : oh
1 : or was it here?
3 : ok
1 : yeah i mean one or the other ok
2 : it , it was
2 : yeah, yeah
1 : 
3 : it's ok if we lose lagoon
1 : mmhmm
3 : umm
3 : what should my third move be?
2 : umm
3 : what else can i do?
3 : move
3 : or give a treasure card but you said you wanted to give me this so i hold on
2 : yeah
2 : yeah i'll i'll give you the statue of the wind when i get a round to it
3 : so should i move toward
2 : umm
2 : yeah i mean i can
3 : ok
3 : go ahead
1 : ok
3 : i got a
1 : ah
2 : i i can do anywhere on the island so you don't have to be close to me.
3 : cool
2 : yeah pull two
3 : two
2 : well awesome i see a change going on
3 : ok and three
2 : ah and then three gotcha
3 : howling garden
2 : ooo
3 : breaker's bridge
1 : mm
2 :  perfect than i was expecting
3 : and whispering garden
1 : oh wow
3 : alright
2 : alright changing the landscape of the game
1 : i can move th
3 : so you are already on so you wanna take the
3 : fire right away
2 : yeah
1 : take the fire
1 : ok
3 : yeah and then
1 : and give you these?
2 : yeah thos just go to
1 : ok
3 : do they go here or here?
2 : umm
1 : i don't know.
3 : i don't know, try one.
1 : over there.
1 : cause those are lost or sunk territory.
2 : yeah those are those are
2 : island tiles umm
1 : yeah
2 : alright
1 : ok so we have this
2 : ah i think
2 : i think
2 : then move two might be like
3 : yeah treasure card
1 : to move
2 : ah
2 : ah
1 : on the chal
1 : you got somebody have the chalice card? is that it? no?
2 : no i don't
2 : i think we can
1 : think so not really
2 : at the moment we could probaby go without the chalice because
1 : mmhmm
2 : we had to
2 : discard one of them to get your room for
1 : right ok so we have total we have three of the ah the
2 : the all the fires
1 : statue cards among us
3 : mmhmm
1 : umm
2 : yes
2 : i was, i was thinking maybe like
1 : mm
2 : that
2 : that one would take too much
2 : or it would require too many spaces.
3 : well we have to
1 : yeah both this is a problem yeah
3 : so shh
2 : yeah 
3 : so engineer should go over to and
2 : yeah
1 : two over to there and shore this up. ok
2 : i was just
2 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : well
2 : well it would be a move to there
1 : move to here yeah
2 : and then
3 : that would be three right?
1 : right
2 : and the third move is shoring up yeah
3 : right third move is shore
1 : alright
1 : that's what i'm thinking ok fine.
2 : there we go. ok that's better, that's better.
3 : ok good choice.
1 : ok
2 : umm
1 : i need you to move again?
3 : ok s
1 : no i've got done with moving so i have to take these. this is cool.
3 : no you're done.
3 : ok so you get two.
2 : yeah
1 : ah chalice and umm
1 : whatever that thing is.
2 : oop there we go out.
2 : oop
1 : oh that's the this oh ok
2 : ok i like where we're going umm
3 : ok earth's
1 : umm
1 : ok so that's good so we're getting these.
3 : and then you chose three for
2 : then
2 : yeah three
1 : three of these two three.
2 : please don't be the temple of the moon
1 : mm
1 : cave of embers, where's that over here?
2 : right there
3 : you got that.
2 : so alright we already have ww had the crystal, it's ok.
1 : that's under water, ok.
1 : copper gate
1 : here oh that's not good. ok
2 : mm
1 : well maybe
1 : ah and crimson forest here
2 : we'll see
3 : we just can't isolate anything
1 : ok
2 : alright
3 : ok good choices.
1 : fine, this is good.
2 : we survived, survived the barrage.
1 : not too bad all things considered right. and these go here.
3 : ok does go right down on top.
2 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : that's fine, that's fine.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mm
2 : alright
1 : mm
3 : so
2 : let me
1 : mm
2 : umm
2 : here
2 : i'm going to
2 : shore up the temple of the moon
3 : good call
2 : i'm going to
3 : i wouldn't
2 : umm
2 : probably shore up copper gate
3 : i would anyway ah and then
2 : ok
2 : shore up copper gate cause yeah i don't want to be stranded up in there.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : and then
3 : i would move to well
2 : umm
3 : i'd move to the temple because we can each give you
3 : one and then you'll be on it for your next turn
2 : yes, yes, yes
1 : good mm
2 : ok so
3 : ok
2 : alright then
2 : let's see what the treasure has for me
2 : ah boy water's rise
2 : ok
2 : well
2 : well ah we're still still at three
1 : we're still on three yeah
2 : the waters have risen
2 : umm put that there
1 : do we have a time on this or is it just
1 : is there like, is it a thirty minute thing or
3 : it's right here, nineteen yeah
1 : oh it's right here, oh we still have twenty ok
2 : oh i did i didn't even see it
1 : yeah we're cool i think
2 : i
2 : well ok well
2 : we'll have we'll have a fighting chance, ok so
1 : 
2 : now shuffle these
3 : shuffle
1 : mm
1 : mm
3 : shuffle that
2 : that's discarded
2 : ok i have five here
2 : one
2 : two, three
1 : mm
2 : breaker's bridge is gone
1 : ok
2 : that's
3 : mm
2 : not the
2 : the best thing in the word umm
2 : whispering gardens is also gone.
3 : oh no
1 : ok wow this is looking dicey
2 : well let's ah
1 : and
3 : ok
2 : and howling gardens is
2 : a bit soggy as they say so
1 : uh huh
3 : ok
2 : let's
2 : umm
3 : and did you
1 : mm
3 : you get
3 : you're good so
2 : you
2 : ah yes
1 : mm
3 : i should use my sandbags cause it doesn't count as a turn and save howling gardens
2 : yes good call, good call
1 : mm
3 : ok
3 : and then i want to
3 : which one do you want?
2 : umm
3 : well this one
2 : i'll take ah
3 : i can give you
3 : and then you can discard the fire since we already have the fire.
2 : are you, are you able to give it to me
2 : yeah are you
3 : oh no i can't
2 : no not
2 : you could use your helicopter
3 : i can
2 : to meet me up at the temple of the moon.
3 : move all of
2 : maybe?
2 : or
3 : just
2 : just yourself?
2 : maybe ah i don't know umm
3 : yeah i can do that
2 : ok
3 : i'm hoping we will get another one
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok so that's that's first move.
3 : ok so that's my first move and then i'm gonna give you this and then you can get rid of the fire.
2 : ok
2 : yeah
2 : second move is
2 : i would discard the fire
3 :  that's my second move
3 : and then
2 : third move umm
3 : ss
3 : save crimson
2 : all all all up to you i mean
2 : ah i don't
1 : mm
3 : or start moving toward something else
2 : but i, i haven't seen a misty marsh in a while which means i think it's gonna be due
3 : so move
2 : i was thinking maybe if you save the crimson
2 : that would at least allow me
3 : right
2 : to to
3 : ok i mean there's no harm in
2 :  it down. yeah, yeah
3 : cause there's nothing around ok
2 : yeah ok so
3 : so i'm good and then three
2 : well ah there we go ok that was a good draw
2 : very good draw
3 : one
3 : two, three so crimson goes back
2 : alright
1 : nice try
3 : oh
2 : so is temple of the moon, ok well hey at least we
1 : ok
3 : and then where is this one?
1 : mmhmm, oh you're both on swampy ground ok
2 : cave of ember
3 : cave embers is gone.
2 : what is that it?
2 : that's
2 : that's not a big deal.
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : we we'll be able to get the fire crystal, awesome crystal fire
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : here you go
2 : alright
1 : mm
2 : oh do we ok no we're good, we're good
3 : ok so
1 : it's my turn or oh you're still
3 : no it's your turn

1 : what have we got in the way of the chalice? nothing? but you have one and i have one
2 : i have i have one over here.
1 : yeah
2 : i mean i could
2 : ah i was gonna say
1 : i i can give you this
1 : as one of my moves and then you can
3 : yeah
2 : if you, if you can make it up to the temple of the moon which
2 : it's gonna be
3 : yeah
2 : yes i don't think it's possible
1 : not right now no
2 : umm
2 : yeah
1 : mm
2 : but
2 : but
2 : let's try
2 : let's try to get the pilot
2 : umm
1 : to
3 : i can, i can well i think she should just go here because you can
1 : fly me there
3 : i can fly both and give her two
3 : and that would be three.
2 : ok yeah and then then i'd give her a fourth one.
3 : yeah cause you have that power right?
2 : right
1 : ok
3 : ok so next turn you give that?
2 : yeah i i, yeah i can do anywhere on the island, awesome
1 : yeah ok so then i will move to here
3 : and be done?
1 : and that's done. i don't have to move further if i don't want to. ok now i need these
3 : no
2 : no, no
1 : ok chalices, i have three chalices now.
2 : well that
1 : that's pretty cool and then two, three of these right?
2 : there you go
2 : umm
2 : yeah
1 : one, two, three
1 : silver gate, where's silver?
2 : right here.
1 : ok umm
1 : so swampy
1 : lost lagoon is really lost.
2 : that's fun
1 : umm and copper gate is soggy.
2 : that's ok
1 : that's ok too. we're not so bad.
3 : well we can't isolate so
1 : ok
1 : these go here.
1 : ok so that's mine.
1 : that's my moves.
2 : ok
2 : i'm going to
2 : shore up the temple of the moon
1 : going to good idea.
2 : i'm going to shore up
3 : you wanna give her?
2 : oh also i'm gonna give you the
3 : your
3 : well which one do we want to do first because we can
1 : either way i can give you this or you can
3 : we can target this
2 : ok umm i'll give you
3 : umm let's do this first cause she'r right on it.
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : or 
3 : and then your next turn we can move her here and she we can get all those
2 : ok, ok so i'm going to give you this card
1 : ok good yeah
1 : ok
2 : and you have to discard
1 : i have to discard something
2 : ah discard
1 : that's a hard choice
3 : i'd s i'd say the
2 : that's a tough call
3 : earth
2 : yeah discard the earth because it at least leaves one of us with
1 : yeah ok
2 : over over half of
3 : and i'm sure you'll get another one
2 : yeah hopefully
1 : mm
2 : ok so i have
3 : ok so
1 : so that
1 : mm
2 : two moves left?
2 : 
3 : 
1 : yeah
3 : i think so, yeah one action per card.
2 : umm
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok
2 : ok so
3 : we need to shore up something over here
2 : oh yeah yeah i'll shore up
2 : or
2 : why don't i move here
2 : and shore up the copper gate
3 : sounds good.
2 : alright
2 : so that was that was three actions right?
3 : mmhmm
2 : treasure, treasure, treasure, treasure says
2 : ok i have
2 : statue of wind
2 : chalice of the ocean
2 : ah which one's i have to discard one, and i will discard the
2 : statue of wind
1 : alright
2 : ok
2 : so now it's
1 : 
2 : time to see what i'm gonna drown
2 : probably going to be
1 : you need three though
2 : ok coral palace
1 : mm
2 : the bronze gate
2 : is ok
2 : dunes of deception
3 : ok
2 : and the good draw
1 : mm
2 : ok those all go here
2 : umm
3 : so
2 : water's rise
2 : or no that wasn't water's card ok.
2 : then
2 : your turn
3 : so
3 : mm i should move
1 : mmhmm
3 : i can move anywhere so how about i just move over
3 : here
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok good
3 : give you
3 : so that
3 : these would be my three because one turn, two three
1 : ok great
2 : well there we go, there we go
1 : so now all we have this?
3 : yup
2 : yup and we can put this
1 : take this off the board and do i give this away or i don't?
2 : over here
3 : well
2 : or
3 : yeah let me do this first and then
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : ok and then
3 : three we might be losing something
3 : only have five
1 : five cards in my hand oh right i have to get rid of something duh ok. alright so we'll just get rid of one of these?
2 : ah
2 : give her the chalice yeah cause we still have there's
1 : mm
1 : we still have a couple of we have
3 : well that's six cards you still have to get rid of two
1 : oh
2 :  another chalice yeah we
1 : another chalices we have several chalices ok
2 : we have
3 : yeah
2 : there's four on the table
1 : and now we have this, so this is good.
3 : ok so i did two. so now we need three
2 : yeah so you can
1 : mmhmm
3 : misty marsh
3 : ah tidal palace and
3 : temple of the sun
3 : ok
2 : alright
3 : so go ahead
1 : ok ah
2 : alright you can
3 : mm
2 : you can i think take the statue of wind with your four cards
1 : i  yeah so take these
3 : we have two
2 : awesome
1 : ok where do these go? over here.
2 : the discard pile
3 : mmhmm
1 : alright ok so we have two of these
2 : umm
3 : so that's one turn
1 : ok so that's one turn, now i have
3 : and should you give me your
1 : i can give you my chalice
3 : because i can fly anywhere
1 : yeah it's good
2 : then i, i can give you
2 : two of these at some point in the future
1 : so
3 : we need to shore up one of these
2 : oh yeah that would be that too that'd be a good idea. i will i'll do that on my next turn
1 : ok oh i have, i can shore something up. i can shore up two as one turn.
3 : ok
2 : umm i'm right up there.
3 : does it have to be adjacent?
1 : doesn't say
1 : adjacent, just says shore up two tiles for one action.
1 : huh
2 : mm
2 : umm
1 : move, hmm
1 : i don't know does it have to be?
1 : ah adjacent?
3 : umm i don't know.
1 : mm
2 : i don't think it says it in the rules, just
1 : no i don't see anything, it just says two tiles per action.
2 : just
2 : just two per action
1 : ok
1 : so i can do that i
2 : or
3 : mmhmm
1 : flip an island from flooded back to normal.
3 : if you're adjacent to it, so yeah you do have to be
2 : adjacent oh yeah, yeah it still counts
1 : what i still can
2 : you have to be, you have to be next to it yeah
1 : adjacent, i have to oh i can't
3 : so you can move toward one if you want
2 : i mean yeah you could do
1 : ok
2 : do, do maybe coral palace cause
1 : yeah
2 : i can i'll when it's my turn, i'll take the tidal palace
1 : ok fine
3 : so do you want her to move toward it or
2 : yeah
1 : yeah but i can't go diagonally
2 : well
3 : so you just want to go here
1 : so just go this way yeah
3 : ok
1 : umm
2 : ok
1 : ok so that's one move
1 : now
2 : i think, i think you have one left, i mean you could
1 : i have one left yeah
2 : actually how about
2 : umm
2 : i'll let you go here and then when it's your turn again
2 : hopefully, hopefully we don't lose
1 : lose the other that's a good idea, let's just do that
2 : these two
2 : yeah even if we, even if we lose that one, that's fine but
3 : good
1 : mmhmm yeah fine ok
3 : ok
2 : don't want don't want to lose that one
2 : awesome ok so
3 : so let's hope that
1 : awesome
1 : now
3 : this isn't
1 : take two, two of these
2 : treasure cards
2 : this could be water's rise, did the water's rise?
1 : helicopter lift, ok
1 : one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile and water rises of course.
3 : ok
2 : i bet well still, there's still
1 : i mean we're still on three, so it's not that terrible yet
2 : it's still three, it's alright, it's alright.
1 : ok so this goes
1 : there
2 : yeah that goes over here.
3 : over here
1 : mm
1 : just take the top three off here
3 : oh you gotta shuffle put it down and then you take
1 : shuffle these first, ok fine.
2 : yeah shuffle
1 : mm
3 : i can't remember what was in there
1 : no
2 : every, everything is in there more or less.
2 : just, just hope hopefully not the important ones ok
1 : right everything was in there.
2 : oh wait
3 : ok
3 : does he still take
1 : two, three
2 : and we need, we need one, two
3 : three
2 : come on, come on, come on, come on
1 : ok ah silver gate
2 : it's alright
1 : silver gate, ok that's we don't need that one
1 : copper gate
1 : that's just under water
2 : 
1 : or soggy that's ok
2 : it's alright.
1 : crimson forest
2 : that's gone doesn't matter
1 : where's oh it's gone that's alright fine.
2 : alright
1 : ok so that's cool
2 : alright let's go let's
1 : wing
2 :  gets some land under me. i'll shore up this one.
2 : and we'll
2 : move to this or i will shore up this
3 : what did we say that we were going to do for
2 : umm
3 :  this
2 : like ok for my third action
2 : i will
2 : give
2 : to anyone to give treasure card
2 : that i can give to a player anywhere on the island
2 : for one action per card
2 : oh wait. oh i only have
1 : mm
2 : i mean i could
3 : so you have three
2 : do, do we
2 : do we take a chance and
2 : possibly like
2 : sink that copper gate
2 : or, or take back the second action
2 : and then
2 : i give you these two cards
2 : but then take a risk of copper gate being flooded again, i don't think that's a good idea.
3 : i can unflood it well yeah
2 : ah that's very risky for me
3 : it's up to you
2 : ok well
2 : umm
2 : third action i will give
1 : mm
3 : cause you can't
2 : you a
3 : do either of these until my turn so
1 : mm
3 : we have to take a risk no matter what.
2 : shoot
2 : ok well
2 : i will give you
1 : hmm
2 : this as my
2 : third action.
3 : i think you should undo that and give me two cause then
2 : or
3 : well no it doesn't matter, no that's fine
2 : i think i can only give
3 : ok
1 : yeah we we're also running low on time suddenly so we
2 : well ah one card per action
3 : ok so go ahead
2 : yeah
1 : want to make our decisions and go yeah.
2 : ok
2 : alright
2 : so
2 : oop
2 : chalice and gotta drop one. drop the
2 : statue of wind, ok we have three, one, two
2 : three
