1 : ok
2 : alright
2 : go
3 : mister engineer
1 : i'll go first, i'm gonna
1 : use my skill
2 : ok
1 : do that, i'm gonna move, then i'm gonna lift these two up.
2 : we can use your skill.
2 : no, you can't do that, no you can't do that.
1 : oh, can you use it twice?
1 : that's so dissapointing
2 : oh, you tried,
1 : ok
3 : hmm
1 : well then i'm gonna
2 : you tried.
2 : ok
1 : which one do you guys think is better?
2 : so, that was,
2 : that was two actions that you did?
1 : mmhmm, so now i can lift one more up.
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok
1 : what do you guys think?
2 : umm
3 : uh, we don't want to become disconnected from anything
1 : so
2 : i'd do cliffs of abandon.
4 : hmm hmm
1 : let's go for it
2 : yeah,
3 : mmhmm
2 : because it's in the middle of all of us.
3 : right, yeah.
1 : good idea
2 : ok,
2 : so then
1 : does anyone have
3 : draw some cards.
1 : ok
2 : oh, yeah.
1 : oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : mmhmm
1 : is it always two?
3 : yeah, i think so.
2 : yes.
1 : ok
1 : oh, no guys, the water rose.
2 : alright
1 : so
2 : it's alright.
1 : the water rises
2 : 
4 : uh
1 : help me out again
1 : do that?
2 : i'll put that in the
1 : put this back.
3 : mmhmm
1 : shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top. oh
2 : you go ahead, shuffle it,
2 : shuffle it good.
1 : alright
2 : and you draw
2 : two.
1 : two
3 : mmhmm
1 : so, phantom rock
2 : alright
1 : and lost lost lagoon, lost lagoon.
2 : uh, we lost phantom rock.
3 : phantom rock is gone.
1 : oh we didn't want it anyway.
2 : it's fine, we don't need it
1 : it was like
2 : except for
2 : if we get caught on one of those.
2 : nobody get stuck on iron gate, please.
1 : eh
2 : alright,
2 : so,
2 : cool, now it's my turn now, i think.
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : yup
1 : mmhmm, definitely.
2 : alright
2 : so,
2 : pick up two, three actions.
1 : it's ok, we don't need that one.
2 : i'm on silver gate.
2 : i am
1 : and this one
2 : going to what do you guys think we should do?
1 : how many do you have?
2 : i could
2 : move
1 : oh
3 : umm
1 : i
3 : let's think
1 : guess 
2 : if i took three actions, i could kind of
1 : you can lift these
1 : one of these up, yeah
2 : oh yeah, if i come down to whispering garden
2 : then i can lift
2 : breaker's bridge
1 : oh, wait oh.
3 : was well what about, yeah
1 : one, two, oh i guess it doesn't
3 : what if you were to move here so you could flip both of them? is it too late for that? can we
2 : uh no, because the actions will still be it'll still umm
1 : you still can only lift one of them.
2 : i can only lift one because i only have three actions. i started out here, one,
3 : ah true, ok.
2 : two, and then if i move here. so then i'm closer to cave of shadows and coral palace.
3 : got you
1 : same thing i guess
1 : works for me
2 : so i can get on one of those
3 : alright
2 : and then, i draw
2 : two of these bad boys
1 : hmm
2 : sandbags.
2 : oh
2 : earth stone
1 : nice.
2 : alright
2 : and then
2 : i draw
1 : yup
3 : mmhmm
2 : two of these.
2 : cliffs of abandon and breaker's bridge.
1 : ah
2 : see
2 : it was a good call.
1 : so
1 : cliffs of abandon
2 : oh wait, i need to put that on top of there.
1 : mm
1 : no i thought that was only when this moved.
3 : uh, let's sett
2 : umm
2 : yeah, check it first.
3 : uh
1 : do you guys remember?
3 : no idea actually
1 : can we ask for help?
2 : yeah
3 : feel like we should remember
1 : can you point to us?
2 : ok
1 : water rise card
1 : shuffle
3 : ok, so only when we get the water's rise card, were good
1 : yeah, that's what i thought, ok
2 : ok, ok.
1 : great, i guess
2 : good
1 : so cliffs of abandon's right here
2 : k
2 : yeah and breaker's bridge so it was good that we
1 : oh oh
1 : so we should yeah
2 : fixed those cause i would've been swimming.
1 : do some fixing.
3 : umm, alright
2 : it's too cold to swim
2 : one, two, three, four, ok
3 : we're set
2 : umm
3 : ok
2 : that's that
1 : so pilot
3 : yup.
3 : yes, i have these
1 : i guess
1 : what do you
3 : 
1 : so what's like the plan to do when we don't have many cards at the end
2 : you can move anywhere.
3 : ok
1 : i just like, just,
3 : uh, we wouldn't try to like appropriate them
2 : i don't know.
1 : just lift things up i guess and like
3 : lift, yeah and
1 : yeah get ready.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : and try to i guess we can always trade cards.
2 : yeah, try and stack a yeah.
1 : mmhmm
3 : or you know, give cards.
3 : so i guess
2 :  try and
1 : so
2 : stack it up some where
3 : huh, i have
1 : should we go for golden gate because i can definitely get these in
3 : oh right, because that's the most important
1 : is it important?
3 : yeah, it has whatever the oh that's the starting point, ah.
2 : what's on gold gate?
2 : uh
1 : no, that's just the starting position. i don't even think it really, i don't think that matters.
2 : no, it's just the starting point for a team member that isn't here.
3 : ok
3 : umm, well i don't wanna lo uh
1 : it's just like
2 : so, if you move to temple of the sun or moon
3 : yeah
2 : i got two earth stones things
1 : wait
3 : temple of the sun or moon
2 : and then
1 : do one of these have a umm mark of wood show on the back ok, it would show on both sides
2 : no, it'll, it'll show it on
3 : uh, no, none of them do.
2 : yeah
3 : i feel like i should save as many as i can just so we don't we're not losing tiles right off the bat.
1 : mmhmm,
1 : true, if you go here you could get both of those.
3 : exactly, yeah, and they're both on the same tile, that's always good.
2 : ok
3 : so, i'll move there with my ability
3 : do that
2 : can you yeah move you can't flip two.
3 : yeah, because i'm the pilot so i jumped,
2 : oh yes, he can.
1 : the a-he it's both,
1 : both turns.
2 : oh that was for all three of your moves.
3 : jumped over there.
4 : oh
3 : yup
2 : ok
1 : wait wait wait wait wait
1 : one,
3 : right, right
2 : he moved to here for his first first
1 : one, flip,
3 : flew over there
1 : two
2 : flipped, two,
1 : f you have to stay here to flip the other one though, yeah ok.
3 : flipped three.
2 : yeah, you have to stay there for you to flip
3 : yeah, yeah, yeah ok
3 : uh, alright, cool.
1 : oh
1 : nice
2 : nice
4 : hmm
1 : you are the pilot
3 : yeah
1 : like
2 : alright
3 : uh alright draw these.
2 : alright
1 : yeah
3 : gotta stop wasting time here
2 : one
2 : yeah
2 : we'll get the hang of it.
3 : whispering garden, golden gate
1 : so whispering garden,
2 : and golden gate.
1 : golden gate's gone.
2 : alright
3 : ah
2 : it's alright we need to keep our eye on whispering
4 : hmm
1 : we don't, we don't want that one anyway.
2 : garden though.
3 : mm
1 : yeah
2 : because, since we got a water's rise card, we're
1 : alright explorer.
3 : mmhmm
2 : not good.
4 : ok, what do i any suggestions?
3 : yeah
3 : alright
2 : alright
1 : so, i'd s you can move diagonally, so i'd say
2 : umm
3 : mmhmm
1 : move here and then you can lift both of these up.
3 : yeah, that sounds like a perfect plan.
1 : that's like all three, i think.
4 : ok.
3 : yup
2 : ok
4 : 
3 : and i'll just go ahead and pick these cards
1 : and then yeah
2 : mmhmm
4 : uh alright
3 : for you
4 : ok dokey
2 : watcha got?
4 : got uh
4 : two of those,
1 : nice
2 : ok
4 : one of those,
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : awesome.
4 : and uh need uh two of those.
2 : yeah,
1 : yeah
2 : just trying to think, maybe we could, umm
2 : start like
1 : yeah
1 : giving away things
2 : use
2 : yeah, like earth stones can come here at some poin like when they start,
3 : yeah we definitely should
4 : so
1 : yeah,
1 : exactly
3 : mmhmm
2 : when every body gets their turn.
3 : uh n
4 : so
3 : as of now
1 : oh, so what did you get?
3 : yeah sorry go ahead.
4 : i got these,
2 : uh you have to be on the same
1 : or lifting the iron gate
3 : iron gate, temple of the moon.
4 : uh
2 : temple of the moon is there
1 : temp oh, ok. uh oh
3 : alright, i got that one.
4 : right
2 : iron that's bronze, that's iron.
3 : there we go.
1 : ok
3 : so i do notice we both have these, uh
4 : ok
2 : ok
4 : yeah
3 : the fire ones and you have two?
1 : mmhmm, i have a fire too. ok
4 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : so umm, alright but we can't, we can't give them this turn.
4 : ok
2 : so, you can
1 : so i guess you're done oh, can you pass me those? oh
2 : you can't give them, yeah you have to be on the same for you guys, you all have to be on the same tile to give cards
4 : these two
3 : ah to give, yeah ok
1 : oh yeah
4 : uh
3 : alright
1 : ok
1 : great.
1 : so
1 : i'll move
2 : ok
3 : you
2 : yup
1 : one
1 : so i'm red right? so i can go one, two, i can lift this up.
2 : so, ok
3 : 
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : cool.
1 : and then that's all three of my things.
2 : and two, yeah that's all three of your moves.
3 : yes, that's it.
2 : and then
3 : mmhmm
1 : oh thank you
1 : and i gotta
1 : ch
2 :  water's rise.
1 : water rises again guys
3 : ah fine fine
2 : go ahead and move that and i'll shuffle this for you.
4 : hmm
1 : can you pass that?
3 : yeah
2 : well, i mean we only have one that's we could get rid of and
1 : well,
1 : yeah
1 : we don't even want that one.
2 : we're gonna be fine, we don't even need it!
1 : oh, now i go
1 : three
2 : three
3 : yup
3 : three more
1 : whispering garden we gotta
2 : son of a nutcracker.
1 : get that thing out of there
1 : umm cliffs of abandon
2 : cliffs abandon,
1 : it's right here.
2 : ok
3 : ok
1 : and
1 : breaker's bridge
2 : ok
1 : so this is the
2 : we need to get that out, and we need to get
1 : always someone
2 : umm
1 : is that
2 : we need to ,
2 : we need to get the explorer onto here
1 : yes
2 : and then
2 : anybody and we need to get you back on there
4 : hmm
2 : and you back on there to give him the cards,
2 : so he can get on there.
4 : mmhmm
1 : yes, yes
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
2 : and then i need to make my way here or there.
2 : so
1 : so
2 : my
2 : let's see
2 : does anybody else have the
3 : hmm
1 : well
1 : you could umm
2 : ok
1 : you could always sandbag if you want to do that, but you can use that whenever.
2 : i have sandbag.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : but
2 : yeah
1 : it could be right there and it could just die.
2 : i'm
1 : so
2 : yeah, no i'm gonna
3 : yeah
2 : i'm gonna use this right now, just to
3 : for whispering garden? that's a good idea.
2 : yeah, cause i'm not
1 : ok, so does that that doesn't count as one of your things?
2 : playing with it. that doesn't count as a turn.
3 : correct.
1 : oh, you could've lifted it
2 : umm
2 : i could've lifted a long time ago.
1 : oh well
2 : oops
2 : alright
2 : umm
2 : i think what i'm going to do is
1 : get on one of these things
2 : yeah, get my way towards there. i can't get on one of them i can't get on them just yet.
1 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
2 : but like i'll move there, there. and then i'll sit on cave of shadows for now.
3 : you, you could move there if you wanted. yeah, you have one extra action.
1 : ok, was that that was one, two?
1 : you could get there right now.
1 : or you could
2 : do i?
1 : yeah, that wait, wait, or
3 : yup
2 : one,
3 : cause the sandbag was uh was not an action.
2 : two,
2 : oh
1 : yeah wait, but, but, but do you wanna lift this up before you
1 : and like next turn just go then?
1 : because you have
3 : yeah, that's true.
1 : cause you don't have enough you're not gonna get enough
2 : true
3 : doesn't, doesn't really benefit anything
4 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : no, cause you guys don't have it.
1 : mmhmm
2 : i would need his, which means, he need would need to come to me
2 : to pass it to me.
1 : so, do you just wanna make one,
1 : just pick
1 : two, three, and pick both of those up.
2 : yeah, i think that'd be

3 : uh yeah, yeah
4 : wrong one
2 : i know and i'm moving this so i can
1 : oh, ok, gotcha, gotcha.

1 : so one, two, three
3 : so
1 : and then
3 : i will
2 : no, he doesn't, he can
1 : does that count as a
2 : that's one move for him.
3 : that's one move
1 : oh yeah, you are the pilot, that's great.
3 : two, ah no, i can't give ah, bummer.
3 : umm, ooo unless i do this. is it worth it?
1 : one, two

1 : no, d
3 : ah but then, nah you still couldn't get it next turn, true
2 : uh
2 : oh, but wait, you could
3 : umm, then i guess i'll probably save temple of the moon at this point. there's not, not a whole lot else i can do without sacrificing too much.
1 : s
1 : that's a
2 : yeah and then at some point you should use that
2 : to get me like once
2 : hmm

3 : mmhmm
