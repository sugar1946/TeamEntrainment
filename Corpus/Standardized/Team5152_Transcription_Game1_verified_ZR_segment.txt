1 : mmhmm
4 : i'm much better at word games
1 : is each one of these considered
1 : an action, like each single step?
3 : i think we can only do one
1 : ok
4 : take up to three
3 : that was my understanding, cause if not you'd just be hopping all around the place.
4 : actions.
2 : yeah
1 : right
4 : well the three actions are move, shore up
4 : give a treasure card or capture a treasure.
1 : right, but moving one
4 : yeah
2 : one space is one action.
1 : one step at a time is a single action. k gotcha
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : k
1 : so my first thought was again to
1 : exploit
1 : the advantage that
1 : i have, that you don't have
1 : umm considering how much flooding is going on around me.
1 : umm and so i thought of
3 : mmhmm
1 : getting some of these guys
2 : mmhmm
3 : i think so, for sure
1 : switched over, would that be right?
1 : umm
3 : cover our bases.
1 : so
3 : you don't have to move to flip, right? yeah
1 : yeah i don't have to move i guess i would, so i would
4 : but if you you have to be adjacent right?
1 : yes
4 : so if you moved to
4 : this one then you could flip
4 : these two.
4 : or if you didn't move you could
1 : right
1 : or i could move, flip
4 : yeah, sorry
3 : but he's a little isolated out there so maybe
1 : i, i, i'm less concerned about getting to this one, especially since there's no
4 : yeah
1 : umm
1 : little symbol what one's 
3 : treasure, yeah.
4 : yeah, yeah
1 : whatever this one this purple , so
1 : if i did this as a first move
1 : right?
3 : then you could fip
2 : yeah
1 : and then
3 : that was two, as another
4 : yeah
1 : flip these two as another.
2 : yeah
3 : uh huh
1 : let's go ahead and do that and
1 : bring it up,
3 : alright guys this is good.
3 : this is good, good start.
2 : yeah
1 : bring the little color out.
3 : so that was one for the move, two for the flip,
1 : and then
4 : and you can flip this one too cause you're landed on it, right?
1 : right
1 : and i could flip another one,  don't see any reasons
4 : cause you're landed on it
1 : not to, right can i?
4 : shore up
4 : uh, shore up any adjacent tile
4 : oh it has to be ok that's adjacent. or the island tile your pawn, your pawn is on. so you can
1 : the yeah
1 : your pawn is on, so no reason not to do that. why don't we just do that too.
4 : do that one,
4 : yeah.
1 : alright so that'll be three,
3 : ok
1 : that'll be my three.
2 : and so you, now you need two treasure cards.
3 : mmhmm
1 : and now two treasure cards.
1 : alright
1 : so got the fire thing and one of them is water's rise.
2 : so the water's rise is the only one you have to do first
3 : we have to play right now.
1 : right
3 : the cards are stacked against us
3 : i can tell
1 : alright
1 : move the water level up one tick
1 : alright
1 : and then shuffle the flood discard pile
3 : yeah and we gotta throw those guys away.
1 : and place it on top of the flood draw.
4 : do you do the
4 : alright now one goes over in the discard
3 : yeah and then this guy's
1 : and then this one goes in that corner there, correct.
2 : yeah
3 : and we do it
3 : up right? yes i believe so
4 : yup
2 : alright
3 : cool.
4 : ok
2 : so how many did, do you need to take from this?
4 : ok
4 : you got to two
3 : two
4 : yeah
1 : alright
1 : alright cliffs of abaond and breaker's ridge
1 : so
1 :  god i just
1 : flip em right back i guess
2 : well it was a good decision then cause otherwise they'd be gone now.
1 : yeah
3 : they'd be sunk, yeah.
4 : right
4 : mm.
1 : alright and then these go in here?
4 : mmhmm
3 : yup those go up also.
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok
4 : alright
3 : cool, alright messenger.
4 : sweet
2 : ok
3 : so what do we have, and what are you near?
2 : so
2 : i'm over here
2 : so
3 : and you have a red and a gold
3 : gold ok
4 : hmm not that close yet
2 : so since we know the cliffs of abandon is here
2 : i should probably move and flip that back over?
3 : can you move that
4 : uh no you can only go up or down, left or right
2 : no
3 : yeah you can't move
2 : but if i move
1 : yeah that's what i had been asking about before. if that one and then two and then flip
2 : i can do adjacent ones
3 : one, two
4 : oh that's right you can do an adjacent according to this.
4 : shore up
4 : shore up any adjacent island tile up, down, left, or right
4 : or the one that you're on.
4 : so if you move to that one
1 : yeah you actually wouldn't even have to go here, you could just move over the one and then flip it
4 : right cause it's, it's adjacent, yup.
3 : mmhmm
4 : flip that bad boy back over.
4 : cool
2 : so that was two actions, moving and then flipping.
1 : correct.
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
2 : and so
4 : we're not ev
2 : umm
4 : not gonna give a card or capture a treasure.
2 : i could give a card if anyone
2 : so you have a
1 : mm
2 : a lion and you have a fire
2 : is there anything that we're closer by that would make more sense for me to give up first?
3 : i don't know if it makes sense to be giving up stuff right now, cause we still don't know
4 : mm
1 : right and there's also, there's
2 : ok
1 : two of everything out right now, right
1 : so
4 : yup
3 : yeah
1 : there's not like a natural one to go to right?
4 : yup
4 : k so now you draw
3 : or you still have another move
1 : but you don't have to use it
2 : but you don't have to use it.
3 : you don't have to.
1 : up to three
2 : cause i don't i'm not by anything else to help
4 : yeah
2 : flip anything else over.
2 : unless you want me to head somewhere, i can just move,
2 : like make a move towards the like the
3 : should we all try to be like in charge of
3 : a treasure?
3 : like because you have a gold guy like
3 : you can like, maybe like hang out around here,
3 : or is that premature?
2 : i think yeah i think it's
1 : well the only issue with that is we could draw at anytime
2 : yeah
2 : and then have to move
3 : and then just
1 : the ones that flip it
3 : yeah
1 : would there be any reason to kind of stay towards the middle until we have more information, i 
3 : well if
3 : we need to like share cards if we're close to each other, it's easier to move there and then do the swapping.
1 : that's a good point
1 : that's a good point
3 : so
2 : so just not take a third move then and just move into the cards?
3 : what's your special thing? can give a single card per action to anyone anywhere
2 : it's giving
2 : yeah so i could give
2 : my card
2 : to the other people that have cards like this
2 : or we could wait.
2 : but i'm the only one who can do that so
3 : that makes me think
4 : well
4 : should you draw your cards
4 : to see what
4 : you end up with?
3 : or do we have play first, yeah
2 : i, i have to take my actions first before i can draw my treasure cards.
4 : oh ok
4 : ok
3 : so
3 : what if you just give him the red?
2 : i'm good with that.
3 : yeah and then you know what
1 : fine make it my problem
3 : if it doesn't work out you guys can like hook up on another
3 : square and then give it back.
4 : but the issue though
4 : sorry
4 : is that if he has that
4 : he has to draw two cards so he's gonna have to give up one of his pairs
1 : i'm gonna have to discard something next time
4 : one of his pairs is gonna have to go in the pile
3 : mm that's true
3 : that's true but we don't have anybody else that has fire right now
4 : nope
1 : yeah i don't think there's a natural
3 : yeah i think we just gotta, yeah
1 : but we don't have enough information yet to
1 : definitively say what the
3 : make a real choice.
1 : if there is a right move. so i'm gonna just do it and see what happens.
3 : cool so you got your sandbags, you got your
3 : flying things wow that turned out really well
2 : yeah umm
2 : i have to wait to use this right, cause this is an action? so now i just do the flood
3 : uh
3 : mmhmm
1 : correct
3 : yeah
3 : and it's still two floods
1 : dun dun dun
3 : let's enjoy it while we still have two floods
1 : i know right
2 : so phantom rock and lost lagoon
3 : phantom rock is
2 : that one's gone
3 : so is this one.
4 : oh they're both gone.
2 : ah
3 : we're sunk.
1 : oh
3 : that's cool though cause we don't even need these ones they don't have the
3 : the treasures on them
1 : right they just give us a few more steps, potentially.
3 : yeah
4 : k
1 : it's also less to worry about though.
3 : cool
3 : alright so
3 : i only have one of these rocky looking things
3 : if we wanna keep a couple of these guys maybe
3 : so
3 : we don't need to keep the ones that don't have the treasure right?
2 : you're the
3 : are they just kinda like
3 : just another place to be?
4 : well i think
4 : strategically that one would be an ok one to go away
4 : because it's on an outside
3 : i think so, yeah
3 : yeah
3 : so
3 : i can
3 : move anywhere on the island
3 : so if i move somewhere who's
3 : near someone who needs this
3 : i could give it to them.
3 : the only other person with this is gonna be you explorer.
1 : this
4 : mm
3 : we're both equally far
1 : 
3 : actually i'm really close here
2 : yeah you're actually you're closer
3 : yeah
3 : so why don't i just
2 : but you have to be on the same one to give it to her
2 : like to exchange.
3 : yeah but
1 : but you can fly there,
3 : yeah so i can like fly to you and then hang out and then you could give me the other one and then i can
3 : you know, move towards this guy.
1 : fly back to the
4 : or
1 : the temple.
4 : ok i see what you're saying yeah
2 : but we still need two more cards anyway.
3 : yeah
3 : yeah i'm kinda cool hanging over here
1 : while you do that, maybe we should, now that we have three of the four lions, i wonder if we should start thinking about how to
4 : mm
1 : bring home the flying lion
4 : mmhmm
2 : ok
1 : i don't know if there's oh wait now what can the pilot do to facilitate that?
3 : not much, i can just kinda fly around.
1 : not much right now.
3 : but what i can do is if
3 : the flying lion people are close to each other i can, i can fly you both
3 : to the flying lion
3 : and then you can do the card exchange there.
3 : that's what i can offer.
4 : mm
2 : ok
3 : so right now is, again it's a little premature
4 : we still have to find another one
2 : ok
1 : or do you wanna just f
3 : so i can
2 : draw your treasure cards.
3 : should i just do it?
1 : can you fly somewhere, flip it, and fly back?
1 : are those
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : i mean why not oh
2 : oh,
2 : yeah you could do that
3 : i could right?
1 : you wanna just do that and just
3 : yeah why don't i just flip this bad boy?
1 : keep, keep one step
2 : yeah so fly
1 : this one here? yeah
3 : this guy?
3 : fly, one,
1 : so fly, flip,
3 : two,
1 : and then fly home.
3 : three, cool.
3 : i hope that's not against the rules.
2 : oh
3 : the pi
3 : only once per turn, oh
3 : so i can't
3 : but i can fly here and flip this
2 : and then flip it
4 : and flip it, yup
3 : and then i can move here
2 : and then stay there.
1 : oh gotcha
1 : ok, hmm
2 : ok
3 : that's cool
3 : alright.
3 : i'm gonna
3 : pull two of these
3 : oh i got another helicopter lift
1 : count it.
3 : and i got the chalice.
1 : count it.
1 : alright so you're sittting near five right?
1 : m oh no no you're sitting at four. that's your that doesn't count. that's your
3 : is this not this isn't a card right? yeah, that's kinda misleading.
4 : hmm
1 : who you are card
3 : ok
3 : and then you have the chalices so at some point we should probably like
1 : we should totally get together
3 : try to get together and do that yeah.
1 : yeah
3 : i can fly to you, don't worry about it
3 : alright let's do
3 : floods
1 : yes you need your two flood cards now.
3 : right?
4 : yeah cause you do your
3 : temple of the moon and golden gate, alright
3 : buh bye
1 : buh bye
4 : mm
1 : and what's it called?
3 : temple of the moon.
1 : temple of the moon.
3 : oh this guy oh no that's temple of the sun
1 : that's temple of the sun
4 : mm
3 : temple of the moon
4 : mm
1 : oh oh
3 : but
3 : explorer can move and shore up diagonally. oh so you're gonna wanna probably
3 : flip that over for him.
4 : but i can only go one
3 : oh
3 : we don't have to move that up.
3 : ok sorry i just wanna make sure we didn't have to  that.
4 : right
3 : so
4 : i can only move one space?
3 : can move and or shore up diagonally.
3 : that would just count one of your turns.
1 : right
3 : and i think you should save him
1 : i appreciate it.
4 : so move over diagonally?
3 : oh wait you're green. oh i thought you were gray for some reason.
4 : yeah
4 : no
3 : uh the explorer can move and shore up diagonally
2 : well you can make two moves
3 : or no so you can move and or shore up, so you can move
2 : and then flip
1 : right right
1 : and then shore up
3 : and then shore up
1 : adjacent
4 : oh ok
3 : cause we don't want you to sink
1 : so one
1 : right
1 : two
3 : two
3 : and then
3 : let's look at our cards and see what we
3 : have going on here.
2 : if you
1 : should we get you to the lion?
4 : yeah cause i can give a treasure card
2 : it would be, it would be two actions though right? cause we have to be on the same, like she would have to move up, and then she would have to give me the card, which would be two. she only has one left.
1 : should we start, start collecting
3 : yeah
1 : oh ok that's a good point.
3 : so
1 : i didn't realize i forgot about that.
2 : but i could give her both my card ooo
2 : well if she went on that tile
4 : oh. we have to be on the same tile
2 : i could use two actions to give her my cards
1 : but she can't get all the way over there just yet
4 : i should've moved over there
4 : no cause we still needed to shore that up.
1 : uh mm hmm hmm
3 : yeah we needed to flip you
4 : yup
1 : you saved the moon
3 : because if not we have the treasure on that, so if for some reason we get a flood
1 : and you can also get there
3 : mmhmm
1 : quickly with your
3 : so i
3 : think
2 : well we could do that
2 : is
3 : what if you guys just get close together?
2 : because
2 : yeah, say if you got closer and then
2 : on your turn, since we don't want to like,
2 : lose, since we have pairs, you can give me maybe two of those?
3 : exactly
2 : like either one, and then i'll give up my cards.
1 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : as, as your first move
2 : yeah
3 : and then you can pick up the two and then work from there. i think that's a good idea.
2 : mmhmm
4 : ok
1 : 
4 : so what am i doing?
4 : i was done moving
4 : correct?
1 : you're good.
2 : right
2 : yeah so two treasures.
3 : mmhmm
4 : alright so now i have to do the
4 : alrighty
1 : mm
3 : nice
4 : alright we have the four chalice cards showing
1 : mmhmm
4 : sweet
4 : can i give now?
4 : or if i moved all of my other i've moved and i've shored up
1 : no you 
3 : no
1 : the actions have to completely preceed the yeah
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : ok so let's do the
3 : sinking
1 : mm we go
4 : keep your fingers crossed
4 : whispering gardens and iron gate
3 : iron gate, ok
1 : ok
4 : k
3 : alright we gotta make sure we cause that's got the treasure.
1 : so just bear in mind we have right
4 : yup
1 : alright we good?
4 : that's it.
1 : ok
1 : mm
3 : we need to be c
3 : ready for a flood card to come.
4 : yeah
3 : i think that's what we need to prepare for.
1 : so presumably i
1 : could get over here,
1 : and get that back, if we wanted it.
1 : or we can
2 : you're the red person right?
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : or i could start distributing these
1 :  cause we also have
1 : we have these four
2 : yeah
1 : can you give only one card at a time?
2 : it's like one action per card
3 : per card yeah, giving a single card
2 : so it's like you could give me
1 : ok so i can move one over and give two cards, or move twice and give one.
2 : you could give two to somebody
3 : but you need to be at the same place so
1 : right
1 : right
4 : mm
2 : umm
3 : you could
3 : uh
4 : 
2 : so you could move one action,
2 : two action, and then give me one of the cards this time.
1 : right
2 : and then, when it's my turn in a minute
1 : and
3 : you're gonna give those over
2 : i can give
2 : mine
1 : ok
2 : but then if i give you two
1 : that's two actions
2 : if i give you those two then that means you have to get rid of
4 : i have to get rid of
2 : one of the cards.
4 : yeah.
1 : well if we
1 : do that
1 : should
1 : i move to say this then?
3 : i think so
1 : would that be the
1 :  one, two
1 : and then
3 : oh
2 : and then flip
3 : yeah
1 : flip that.
3 : i think we should cause i'm just afraid of that sinking and then we lose our opportunity
1 : and 
1 : and then we have to get all the way down to the other end.
2 : yeah
1 : and we have potentially the benefit of  right there.
2 : ok so that was three
3 : and then other thing is i can play this at any time.
1 : yes
3 : move one or more pawns on the same tile to any tile
3 : or lift your team off fool's island. so i can move people who are like hanging out with me
3 : anywhere.
1 : right
2 : mmhmm
4 : oh look you got two people on one.
2 : yeah that's me and him.
1 : mmhmm
3 : so you guys can do the swap.
1 : we're walking down the marsh. alright
1 : umm ok, uh god 
1 : umm can i just discard the water's rise card? does that count? 
3 : well we have to use it immediately so then you still have five cards
2 : yeah we have to use it right away
1 : oh bummer
4 : yup
1 : alright umm
4 : crap 
1 : so up we go
1 : to three
1 : alright shuffle the flood discard pile
2 : go ahead
3 : that's what
4 : oh no
3 : 
1 : yup that's
3 : at least you don't have to worry about losing this
1 : this is why, this is why we flip stuff
1 : and then place it on top
3 : alright i'll take that guy and discard
1 : and then discard this card into that pile
2 : and then now you have to take three of these ones
3 : mmhmm
4 : mm
1 : right
1 : let's see here, iron gate
3 : cool we don't need that guy.
3 : dead weight.
1 : breaker's bridge and whispering garden again. that poor garden just
1 : too much water, not enough water
2 : it's a good thing we keep flipping it though, cause it keeps going back over
3 : breaker
1 : see
3 : cause if not that thing would've been sunk
2 : ok
1 : yup
3 : then we would have to somehow and but again i can fly
4 : mm
1 : and so would we
3 : and i can fly you guys too and i keep forgetting that.
3 : ok
1 : alright
1 : you're up messenger, let's see umm
2 : yes
3 : messenger
2 : so i should probably flip that whispering garden
2 : and then
3 : yeah i think we should keep our options open.
1 : yeah if we, if, if we get another flood card there's a good chance that this one's drawn again, now especially now that we're at three.
4 : get
3 : mmhmm
4 : you and i should be together on the same tile
4 : so that she can fly us up to here so that we can exchange
4 : the cards
2 : i can give my cards to anyone
2 : that's my p power, i don't have to be on the same
3 : mmhmm
4 : oh right
2 : tile thing, but the thing is now i have two, but if i give you both that means you have to get rid of something
4 : oh
2 : you have now.
4 : one i'd have to discard
2 : yes
1 : do discards go
1 : to the bottom of that or the pile?
4 : in the pile
1 : ok so we'd be done with
1 : one of em
2 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
4 : mm
4 : ok
3 : but it seems like there's so many
1 : oh are there more than four oh there must be. yeah ok. for some reason i was thinking like if we get rid of the chalice and that's it, that's the one we can't get.
3 : there must be so it seems like we just gotta like
4 : yeah
3 : seems like we should just like risk it.
1 : ok
1 : yeah as long as there's more
3 : i mean it look again, i've never played this, but it looks like there's more in here.
4 : yeah
1 : there would always have to be
1 : yeah
4 : we have those nasty little water rise's
4 : do
2 : so should i give you both of these?
2 : and then you'll discard
2 : one of yours
4 : this one?
1 : discard the chalice. oh actually no, we have all we have four of both of them so it doesn't
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : oh ok
1 : really matter.
1 : i don't think.
2 : you can have
3 : and then we have four of both so
3 : those rock thing or the chalice so it doesn't matter.
1 : right, exactly.
1 : rock thing, the official
4 : ok
4 : rock
4 : is going away
3 : i'm gonna discard that guy.
4 : alright so this
1 : there you go.
4 : three of the four
2 : so that's my three turns.
1 : three of a kind over there
2 : got another sandbag and another lion.
1 : hey
3 : nice
4 : ooo ok
1 : so yeah let's
3 : so what does a sandbag do again?
2 : umm
2 : shore up any one island
2 : one tile on the island
3 : any one tile
3 : before it sinks, but it can't be used with the flood deck ca.
2 : so i
2 : does that mean i don't have to be next to it i can just
4 : mmhmm
2 : choose this one and then shore up
3 : yeah is it at any time?
2 : i mean not on this turn, not
1 : on your next turn, umm
2 : umm
3 : it says any time
1 : 
4 : sandbags can shore up
2 : yeah
4 : any one tile before it sinks but it can't be used if the flood deck card for the sinking tile is already drawn.
3 : so it can be used at any time though
4 : mm
3 : is that true?
1 : it looks like the only limitation is you can't
1 : use it
4 : yes
1 : to save something that was just flooded completely and is sunk.
4 : yeah cause it says action cards can otherwise be played and discarded at any time not just your turn and do not count as an action.
3 : mmhmm
3 : cool
1 : there you go.
3 : that's good to know.
2 : so where the
2 : temple of the moon
2 : gold gate
2 : maybe it's already gone.
4 : there's bronze and silver
2 : i don't s oh wait
1 : mm must be
2 : silver gate
3 : gold gate's already gone.
4 : yeah
2 : and cliffs of abandon
1 : oh
4 : oh oh
1 : it's alright, we, we got your back,
1 : we're all close.
3 : mmhmm
1 : we'll flip it.
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : i have a feeling
3 : so you are the explorer.
3 : cause i feel like i need to move you two together so you can get that last golden card.
3 : right but we can only exchange cards
3 : when it's your turn right, so you can only give when it's your turn.
2 : if you can,
2 : you can take her though to the
2 : either
2 : place
2 : and then
3 : and how you gonna get it to her?
3 : because my power's like i can move two people.
2 : because i don't have to be on the same tile to give my card up
2 : i'm the one who has to give a card up
3 : oh yeah ok
2 : so she just has to be
3 : near it
2 : on the a yeah that way whenever it's her action she can get that
3 : move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile
2 : so maybe first
3 : maybe i should fly to
2 : flip
2 : oh maybe this one
3 : maybe i should fly
3 : yeah i have to move and then flip though.
1 : mmhmm
2 : mmhmm
3 : one
3 : two
2 : two
3 : well should i just fly somewhere?
1 : oh
1 : definitely want you off of this.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : so i don't know like fly here.
4 : yeah
4 : oh
4 : oh poo
2 : temple of the sun
1 : oh
1 : that's harsh.
4 : that's the moon.
1 : that's the moon.
1 : umm
2 : temple of the moon.
3 : that's the one
4 : the sun's over here
2 : temple of the sun
3 : ok well why don't i hang out over here in case that guy goes.?
1 : ok
4 : yeah
1 : that's a way.
3 : so i have to get rid of one of these
3 : i can't give it though right? i have to throw it away
4 : oh that's right you have to discard.
2 : oh yeah
3 : so what should i
2 : well since you have two of the
1 : why don't you dump the purple one
3 : this one?
1 : since that that's the old we already dumped one of em.
2 : or
2 : the one of the helicopters how many helicopter things do you need?
3 : so these are the ones that i can lift our
3 : team off fool's
3 : landing
3 : or i can move the players but these are any time so that's kind of cool.
1 : yeah those are pretty valuable.
4 : mm
3 : so if it's kind of like oh this, this might flood, ah
2 : well maybe you should get rid of your lion one then cause if i'm gonna give her mine on my turn then you don't need that.
3 : yeah
3 : let's do it
1 : good call.
3 : ok
4 : and now the flood tiles.
1 : how many oh my goodness gracious.
2 : three
3 : alright tidal palace,
3 : copper gate,
4 : mm
3 : crimson forest.
2 : up top
4 : alright
3 : least the thing didn't go up.
1 : that's right.
4 : should i move diagonally to here?
2 : yeah i think we should try flipping some of those back over
3 : yeah i think we should flip
2 : so
3 : what if you flip, move, flip
2 : you
4 : so
1 : don't
2 : you can flip diagonally
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : you can shore up diagonally.
2 : so if you move here
3 : so what if you move, flip
2 : can you flip and flip?
1 : well don't forget i'll be able to do two, also, next turn.
3 : yeah, that's true.
1 : but i can't move diagonally.
1 : so if you moved here and flipped
1 : or shored up that one
3 : i think you gotta get here
4 : so i can turn these in.
3 : yeah, or actually i can fly you there, so it doesn't matter.
1 : mk
1 : yeah
4 : ok so
4 : we're running out of time.
1 : oh i didn't even realize we had that.
4 : am i uh
4 : doing this?
3 : i think we gotta flip this guy cause we need that.
1 : yup
4 : ok
4 : so that's
4 : two
1 : and then i think you're right, with her helicopter lifts it's
1 : kinda irrelevant where you move from here.
2 : and so then just leave that and do the card draw?
1 : yeah
3 : why don't you just flip this one
3 : while you can?
2 : oh yeah as another action? yeah.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah might as well.
2 : ok
3 : just flip it
3 : yeah
2 : number three.
3 : and guys we also have to think about this one.
2 : yeah
4 : oh crap.
4 : water's rise.
1 : alright
3 : we gotta shuffle those bad boys
4 : put that over there
4 : and a chalice
4 : we have four of those showing too so i'll discard this one.
1 : we do.
3 : mmhmm
3 : i think we just choose not to keep this one
2 : and then
3 : cause all we need is three treasures.
1 : right exactly, that's why yeah.
4 : yeah
4 : thank you.
4 : breaking bridge.
3 : breaking bridge
4 : that's gone.
2 : breaker's bridge?
4 : yeah, sorry
3 : cool we don't need that one.
4 : iron gate
4 : is that already gone?
3 : that one's gone
3 : right?
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok and whispering garden
3 : mmhmm
2 : so then we have to pull another one?
3 : is that
1 : whispering garden
4 : yup
1 : but we had to toss the one cause it's already gone and flip this now.
3 : yeah
4 : oh wait a minute, whispering garden goes back cause that's not, that's not
1 : yeah
1 : only discard the uh iron gate.
3 : oh oh
4 : ok
4 : and temple of the sun,
4 : which is now gone.
3 : so you have to do it
2 : eh
1 : yeah that
2 : oh with one of the rocks
1 : that purple one's not happening.
2 : so now we gotta
4 : yeah
2 : save that one.
1 : yes but there should be
1 : three here though. where's the third one?
4 : we had oh iron gate
4 : iron gate is the other one.
1 : well this is the one that's already gone though
3 : yeah
4 : it oh it is?
1 : with this one we we replaced.
3 : another one?
2 : thought we alreaady
3 : we did three.
2 : did
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : we re we replaced it already.
1 : so there was whispering gardens, which we had, there was temple of the sun, which we dumped
3 : now that one's gone now
1 : that one's gone now.
3 : and then the third one we replaced.
1 : ok
4 : alright so if it's still showing on the board though, we put it back.
3 : is that right?
3 : yeah
4 : correct
1 : right
2 : yes
3 : yeah so we're good
2 : yes
4 : so these are all gone?
1 : so break uh
4 : breaker's
1 : yeah
3 : yes they're all gone
2 : yeah
1 : yeah those three are gone, yeah yeah, ok
4 : ok
1 : we're good.
4 : ok
2 : ok
4 : uh that's, that's it for me.
1 : alright so umm
3 : who are you next to?
4 : oh
4 : crap you know what?
4 : oh i can't do that until he gets on the chalice.
3 : mmhmm
2 : he's with me
1 : right
1 : umm
1 : so we definitely needed
2 : do you wanna give me some of your cards?
3 : we need to flip that guy
1 : we need to flip this guy for sure.
3 : yeah, well you can flip two at once, i would do
4 : do the copper gate
1 : uh adjacent ones
1 : so i can do these two as one action if i want
3 : mmhmm
3 : i would do that.
1 : and then
1 : ok
1 : i'm fine with that.
3 : just cause we need to save that guy
1 : we definitely need to save this guy.
1 : and we might as well do this while we're at it.
4 : and that's a p pathway.
3 : i think this is important also cause we don't want to isolate the fire.
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : umm ok so
1 : does it make sense to
2 : that was one action
1 : correct.
3 : t minus seven and
3 : seven minutes forty seconds
1 : yeah alright
2 : and then i think that you should give me
2 : either of these.
3 : i think so too.
2 : because you're running out of space, yeah.
1 : a, a pair of them you mean? yeah ok so how bout i give you a pair of them?
2 : so that's two actions
1 : a pair of the fire, correct.
3 : yeah
4 : so that's
1 : and then
2 : and then
1 : two of those please, thank you.
2 : we are two.
1 : alright uh
1 : more purple rock and helicopter lift
3 : nice
4 : oh cool
3 : i have so many of those
2 : ok and then you're
3 : we should start using them, probably.
1 : we probably should.
1 : alright temple of the moon,
1 : crimson forest,
4 : oh gone
1 : uh
3 : ok buh bye
1 : that's alright, and cliffs of abandon,
1 : right there in the middle.

3 : can you sandbag this guy
1 : yeah why don't we use the sandbags too, just

4 : do we have a whispering garden?
4 : garden 
4 : lurking in that pile.

1 : yeah so why don't you start why don't you
2 : if i move
1 : start working down towards the fire and we'll see if i can get them to you somehow cause you can fly
