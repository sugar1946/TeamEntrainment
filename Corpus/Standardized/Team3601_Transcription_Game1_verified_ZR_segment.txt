2 : that's intimidating.
1 : we're gonna die
2 : alright
2 : well i think you have to be
2 : on like, you can't do this one cause you're not
2 : adjacent to it.
2 : i think you have to move first if you wanna do that one.
2 : like you could do this one, but you couldn't do that one
1 : are you sure?
2 : i am pretty sure
3 :  since diagonal
2 : it's either up, down, left, or right.
2 : yeah
1 : and i thought we can just do any of them
2 : i think you hav you have to be
3 : umm
2 : adjacent to them.
2 : unless, what is your, what is your special action?
3 : well you can do
3 : two per
3 : you can do
1 :  per action
3 : yeah
2 : oh yeah, you can do two but you still have to be adjacent to them.
1 : two per
1 :  ok cool
2 : ok
1 : sweet
3 : so that one you can't do either
1 : well
3 : oh you're right, i'm sorry
1 : yeah
2 : yeah, ok, yeah you're good.
1 : ok, that's one action. alright
3 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : so much pressure
2 : mm
1 : ok, another action, hmm
1 : oh
1 : two, that's my second action.
1 : third action
1 : bam
2 : that looks good
3 : nice
1 : and then
1 : draw two of the treasure cards
1 : thank you
1 : huh no
1 : already
1 : ok
1 : uh
1 : so
1 : ok, shuffle the flood discard
2 : unsink that
1 : pile
2 : ok, yeah shuffle these
1 : 
1 : and then
2 : put those there
2 : and then we discarded that
2 : ok, i already did that, yeah
1 : and then
1 : oh yeah, you already did, ok, ok, i
2 : umm
3 : so now you have to take
3 : two
1 : and draw flood cards, oh yeah i gotta take
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, so draw two flood cards.
1 : uh this is complicated.
3 : it's a lot of move in part
1 : ah we're gonna flood these
1 : we flood these now?
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, ok, so gold gate
3 : so gold gate
2 : oop, man he's already gone
1 : oh no!
3 : so i take that
1 : and
1 : breaker's
1 : bridge
2 : right there
1 : ok
2 : thank you for shoring that one up
2 : alright
2 : so are we good then? so then does this one go here?
1 : yeah did we
2 : and i think that hangs out there
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : umm, let's see what you have two fire and a chalice, what do you have?
3 : lion
2 : ok so i can hypothetically give this to you
2 : that would be potentially helpful
1 : yeah
1 : yeah yeah
2 : alright, i'll do that
1 : yeah
2 : and then
2 : i will
2 : shore this guy up
1 : yeah
2 : and i don't think i really wanna do anything else.
2 : if you're on it or adjacent to it
2 : oh, shoot
2 : i thought i was you
3 : yeah i was
2 : i literally just told you you couldn't do that
2 : alright so i'm gonna move and then i'm gonna do that.
2 : ok, super
1 : can't stop this
2 : ok so then i do two is it always two treasure cards?
1 : yeah
3 : i think so, yeah
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : alright i got sandbags and this guy
3 : oh sandbags is good.
2 : and then
1 : sandbags!
2 : yeah that is good.
2 : k cliffs of abandon and lost lagoon
2 : so that's right here
1 : and lost lagoon is right here
2 : ok
1 : and then
2 : cool
2 : and i think that's it
1 : umm
3 : so do you wanna save your sandbags?
2 : umm i yeah i think i wanna save that for a special occasion.
3 : ok
2 : we don't really need lost lagoon, right? because it's not a special tile where you like trade in for a treasure
2 : so like i really don't care if that one dies
3 : ok, so maybe my action i'll move
3 : up
3 : and then i'll
3 : turn this over
2 : that looks good
3 : i don't knoe if i
3 : let's see
3 : i have a lion, maybe i should move to a lion card
3 : towards one.
2 : up to you
3 : see there's one here
1 : mmhmm
3 : oh so you guys are
1 : get that one
1 : oh
2 : oh yeah you could move towards that
1 : go get that one
2 : so what have you done so far?
2 : all you did was
2 : did you move?
3 : i move so i i already did two. i moved. i turned over.
2 : and you shored up
1 : oh you already turned over
2 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : then you could move on that one and then potentially shore up phantom rock in the future but you don't have to
1 : yeah
1 : yeah, cause if
3 : yeah
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : ok
3 : so let me take two cards
3 : so i have another helicopter lift and then
2 : alright, you're loaded
1 : yay
2 : ok and then two more of these
1 : mm
2 : k whispering garden and phantom rock. oh well
3 : ok
2 : we tried
1 : oh we did try
3 : whispering
3 : rock
3 : oh
3 : garden
1 : 
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : so we just hang out there for now
2 : alright
3 : your turn
1 : oh guys this is stressful.
1 : umm
1 : yeah
2 : that's a good call
1 : umm is this considered a this is not considered adjacent
3 : you could do
3 : two per action, i think
2 : that's diagonal to you
3 : oh yeah, you're right
1 : ok
2 : so you could just move down one and then shore it up
1 : yeah
1 : i could do that
1 : yeah, well we're doing that
1 : bam
2 : alright, cool
2 : and then
1 : umm and then two of those
3 : you have a 
1 : what?
2 : yeah you have a third action potentially
1 : was that wait wait, that was one, one
1 : two,
2 : oh you moved me, not you
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah one, two alright, oh, ok
1 : ok
3 : this color is her
1 : i'm red ah ok, i'm red
2 : yeah, yeah red. you're red, i'm gray.
3 : ah she's not gonna remember it that way
2 : yeah
2 : think about that
1 : mm
2 : ok
2 : i don't feel like
2 : i mean you could like potentially move back towards the center if you wanted
1 : and then
2 : yeah, that's probably a good idea. maybe start moving towards one of those.
1 : i guess, i'll try to get over there.
1 : uh yeah, i'm just gonna go down, oh mm
3 : so you have the fire
1 : wait let me
3 : whatever that's called. and then you have the chalice
2 : yeah, fire or chalice, so yeah. just i would just like, move in one
3 : so actually you should yeah
2 : back to whispering yeah whatever. yeah that's good, that's good. ok. and then two of these
1 : like here? cause then we can
1 : and then
1 : and then two of these
3 : three actions
2 : so what did you just do?
1 : yeah that was three.
1 : wait, i was here?
3 : so you
2 : so you shored up that one, then you moved, oh, and then you shored up another one so you can't move again.
3 : ok so you have to stay here?
2 : but you could, you could move there instead of bronze gate, do you know what i mean?
1 : so i shored this, i moved here, and then moved here.
2 : no, cause you shored this one up
1 : that was three
1 : i did?
1 : no
3 : no you didn't shore up i think you turned this over, you moved here
2 : i think so
1 : i didn't shore that
1 : moved there, and then i moved there
2 : and then move
1 : i didn- that was three actions.
1 : yeah
1 : cause it was like i'll flip
1 : two,
1 : three. that was three actions
2 : ok, i believe you
1 : yeah
1 : 
1 : oh, yay!
2 : alright, so you have to discard a card, so maybe get rid of the that one, yeah
1 : oh ok, maybe this lion
1 : oh i have to discard it
3 : i guess here
2 : yeah
2 : ok, and then, yeah
1 : and then
1 : water level
2 : bum bum bum
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon.
2 : temple of the, the sun. ok there we go.
1 : yeah
1 : and then, here.
2 : yup, just put those right there.
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : what should i do?
2 : there's not really anything i can shore up close to me.
2 : i don't really wanna give you guys any of my cards cause that wouldn't make any sense.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : i suppose i could move towards temple of the moon to shore it up and because i have these. ok so i'll move once,
1 : yeah 
1 : mm
2 : move twice,
2 : and shore this up.
1 : yay woo
3 : nice
2 : ok
2 : cool?
1 : yeah
2 : i pull two of these
3 : umm
1 : oh yeah
2 : that's no fun
1 : yeah i assume that water rise 
2 : i know, i'm sorry
2 : k so that takes care of that, we gotta shuffle these
2 : put those there, ok.
2 : then i pull three
2 : iron gate,
2 : lost lagoon,
2 : and whispering garden. k there's whispering garden
2 : island
2 : what is it?
2 : iron gate and lost lagoon
3 : this is gone.
1 : uh that's gone.
2 : and
1 : and
3 : thanks
2 : and lost lagoon, where's that?
1 : right here
2 : k
3 : see it?
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : and that's my turn.
3 : ok, so
3 : i forgot i have these helicopter lifts, so
1 : so what do those do again?
1 : oh yeah you can move
3 : i can move to
2 : so you can move somebody to another spot on the board
1 : move your person
1 : mm
2 : if necessary
3 : but i don't think we're at that point yet, so
2 : no, i don't think we need to yet
1 : we're not at that point yet
2 : so i would give her your fire card and then you're just gonna have to get rid of that chalice card unfortunately
3 : umm
3 : yeah
1 : yay
1 : so we do this immediately
2 : i don't think we can. i think that counts as an action.
3 : no, you have to move
2 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : oh, you need to be on the same tile as her
3 : oh, forgot
1 : only you can do that
2 : oh snap only i can do that.
1 : you can only do that thingy
3 : 
2 : ok, you guys are like literally on opposite ends of the board
3 : ok
1 : so we're gonna work on that
2 : ok yeah maybe just start or you could use one of your helicopter cards to move her
3 : so red
1 : yeah
2 : to the same tile as you.
1 : yeah
3 : i think that actually
2 : i think that's a good idea cause then she's already on the fire tile
1 : that's smart.
3 : yeah
3 : and then if we save one for the end, cause i have two so. ok, so, that's one action
2 : yeah, so we should be good
2 : that doesn't even count as an action, that's like a special action card, so. ok so then you can give her that
3 : oh right, this is anytime. yeah ok
3 : so that's one action,
3 : i see
1 : and then we
2 : that's one
1 : and then we take this immediately, right?
3 : uh, that's yours, yeah
2 : i think that counts as an action in your turn
1 : oh
2 : yeah, cause that's an action type
2 : so you just gotta hold on to those. so discard one of the chalices
1 : oh ok, alright
2 : cause you don't have enough space in your hand.
1 : do i do this now?
2 : yeah
1 : oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
3 : cause, yeah, i think we can only have five
1 : alright, yeah
2 : yeah, you can only have five. ok, so
3 : so i have two more actions left
3 : i don't really
2 : maybe you want to you could move to a different you could like move to
2 : a spot like that and shore up a card, because you have you're a pilot, you can
2 : use that as one of your moves.
2 : you like don't have to step one at a time.
3 : right, so
2 : i feel like whispering garden is somehow important slash almost sinking.
1 : i don't know if she can
3 : so i can fly here
1 : yeah, that's imp that's important cause that's a
2 : yeah you can fly there and then you can flip it over.
3 : and then turn
3 : so that's three.
2 : cool
3 : ok
2 : so then you get two treasure
3 : so sandbags and then
3 : whatever this is, i forget.
2 : the earth stone
3 : earth stone, ok
3 : then, three
2 : three of these, whoof. ok, temple of the moon,
1 : oh no
2 : breaker's brigde,
2 : and cliffs of abandon.
2 : ok
3 : i forget when do we shuffle?
2 : so that's when the water's we could pull up like a water's rise card and it goes back on top.
3 : when we
3 : ok
2 : ok, so then you
1 : ok
2 : can turn those in
1 : yeah
1 : and let's see, i'm red, ok.
1 : ok
2 : s yeah
1 : and then
3 : so that's
3 : two
2 : no that's three, cause the trade in is counts as one.
3 : oh you don't that's three.
3 : ok
1 : oh , oh yeah
1 : ok
1 : ok
1 : and then three of these
2 : ok, cool
2 : i always get nervous now when we pull those cards
1 : yeah
1 : howling garden, crimson forest, and
1 : copper gate
2 : copper gate's there, crimson forest is above.
2 : whoof
3 : wow
1 : at least we're still alive
2 : it's true, we haven't
2 : sunk yet, ok.
2 : so
2 : now what?
2 : i think you guys should give me your earth stone cards at the earliest opportunity cause then i could trade that in
3 : and you can
2 : but right now, i think i should probably shore some stuff up.
3 : yeah
3 : so this one is the
3 : what is it called again? that
3 : earth stone
2 : earth stone, yeah, so i should shore that one up.
3 : maybe you can go and maybe you can go here too and then shore up
1 : yeah
3 : well maybe shore this up
3 : too.
1 : just shore both of those.
2 : i could shore up all oh yeah, mm, mmhmm
3 : yeah and then move
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok
2 : that seems like a good idea. should i in the mean time use my sandbags to shore something else up? or should i
1 : ye yeah shore
1 : no, no, we're not
1 : i mean
1 : maybe that one cause that seems important cause it has the treasures
1 : on it.
2 : we also have whispering garden though so should i hold on to it? i feel like i should still keep this in the reserves, i don't know.
1 : oh
1 : umm
1 : yeah just keep it
2 : ok
1 : and then shore both of these up
1 : and move here so you can do that later.
2 : bam bam
2 : bam.
2 : ok
3 : i have a sandbag as well.
2 : ok, yeah so, we've got those
1 : so yeah, you use, use it for that
2 : i feel like once should i use it?
3 : so maybe you should use it for this
2 : cause we can always have whispering garden, as long as that one doesn't sink we're ok
1 : oh ok so
1 : well that was three moves though.
1 : ok
2 : yeah, sorry.
3 : yeah
3 : but the sandbag can be used at
2 : but this is an extra
3 : umm any time.
1 : at any time?
2 : yeah
2 : i feel like once we're down to like one of these things, then we can start using our sandbags. do you know what i mean? ok
3 : ok, yeah, that works
1 : well
1 : but we're risking that though, like cause if that gets picked
2 : then we still have
1 : then we're gonna lose that whole
2 : them no then we still have this guy.
2 : we still have the
2 : this guy
2 : on there.
2 : so we could still use this tile to capture that treasure.
2 : cause like we have two there are two tiles for each of the treasures
1 : mmhmm
2 : so like i feel like once we're down to one tile that's when we start using our sandbag.
1 : but we're not like, we can just be safe with it
1 : and do it now and we don't ever have to like keep losing cards, you know
2 : that's true.
2 : do we wanna do that?
1 : cause we have a time limit
2 : i just don't know how many sandbags are in the deck
3 : uh
3 : that's exactly
1 : we also have a time limit
3 : uh
2 : like what if we're super desperate? what if fool's landing needs to
2 : needs a sandbag
1 : i feel like you should definitely use yours for that one. she could probably save hers cause we don't have any other ones that have treasures on it.
1 : easy
3 : i feel like we should save at least one for the fool's landing
2 : ok, then i can use the one if we feel good about that
1 : yeah, let's use that one for this one, just for right now, cause these other ones are like
1 : not important
2 : they're less important.
1 : yeah, and we can save her sandbag
2 : ok, that's fine.
1 : that's what i think 
1 : just be safe
2 : alright.
2 : so then i still have to pull two treasure cards
2 : gosh dang it
1 : it's always you!
2 : i know, it's always me.
2 : ok, that goes there
2 : at least it's still at three and we're not at four yet. once we hit four i think it's like bad news bears from there on out.
2 : ok
1 : we're doing pretty well, i think
2 : copper gate, crimson forest, howling garden. oh well
3 : oh, this one
2 : k, copper gate and then crimson forest. oop crimson forest
2 : is hitting the dirt.
3 : where's
1 : no
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : we tried, see, cause you were there
2 : it's true, i know. copper gate would've bit it if i didn't shore that one up.
1 : you were there
1 : yeah
2 : ok, umm
3 : so my turn, so
2 : yes
3 : i should give you
1 : yeah
2 : thank you
3 : one
3 : that's one action
2 : oh, on the same oh not that again
3 : ah
1 : oh ok
3 : i just said it
3 : when she started walking i just knew
1 : you should hi ok, so helicopter, well
1 : helicopter
2 : so you could, you could
3 : ok
2 : pilot to me or you could helicopter. i think you should save that helicopter
3 : yeah
1 : ok, what's a pilot
2 : so you could pilot to me if you wanted?
1 : yeah pilot
2 : but you also don't have to feel pressured to pilot to me
1 : i feel like you should totally feel pressured
1 : cause i'm gonna do this later like right after you
3 : yeah, i think that's it cause you're on the
1 : yeah
2 : but how are you gonna
3 : carsd, so.
1 : how am i getting to you? wait, wait, pause, don't do it yet. where are you at?
2 : i'm gray. how are, how are you gonna get to me is the question?
1 : you're gray
1 : and i'm red
1 : boom, boom.
1 : actually no, that's not on yours, that's not on hmm.
2 : i mean you could use all three of your turns to get to me or three of your actions to get to me but then
1 : boom, boom
2 : we're
1 : 
2 : just abandoning
1 : but then i'm like how am i gonna get over here anyways. i can't even do that like one, yeah
2 : it's true, yeah.
1 : and then she's over here 
1 : she's over here.
3 : yeah that's me.
1 : how do you have any more turns left?
2 : so you could, you could shore this up
1 : do you have a turn?
3 :  three.
1 : oh see she can
3 : i just started.
2 : so you could shore this up, move to me, and then give me the card
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : i think that works
2 : i feel like that's a good compromise, ok.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : so shore breaker's bridge,
2 : move to i'm gray.
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah, and then give her your thingy
2 : and then give me the earth stone. thank you
1 : and that pilot
1 : card we have to give up to right? cause you
2 : no
1 : did she pilot?
3 : this is just my umm
2 : no cause that's just like her regular card
1 : oh
3 : ok
1 : ok
3 : well that was three.
3 : so i have another helicopter lift and then lion
2 : alright, that's good to know.
2 : alright, cool
1 : ok
3 : so, can i have three?
2 : lost lagoon,
2 : whispering garden and
2 : temple of the moon.
2 : so lost lagoon is gone,
1 : no
3 : no
2 : whispering garden and temple of the moon.
3 : thanks
2 : mmhmm
1 : so what was the plan again from here?
3 : so you, you have to give up that card. so you have to first move
1 : i don't if
1 : first move to her
2 : right, so you were gonna take all your turns to move to me
1 : great
1 : one,
2 : do you feel bad about that?
1 : two, three
1 : one, two, three and then i can give you one card that's not a move
2 : mmhmm
2 : right
1 : i can
2 : oh, no that is a move
1 : that's a move
2 : snap
1 : 
2 : i mean you could just like move
1 : so you can't take a card, you can only give cards
2 : right
3 : what about if you just move
2 : you could just like shore up a coup
3 : twice
2 : yeah
3 : nah, cause you need to be on here too
2 : i know
2 : but i could just hang out there next turn
2 : or like
2 : what if you
1 : you can hang out there, you can shore this up
1 : hang out there, i'll shore this up.
2 : what about i feel bad if for whisp we have both of these
1 : move here.
1 : mm
2 : that are
2 : compromised
3 : yeah maybe should stay because i have two helicopter lifts, so i can move
1 : you have those helicopters
1 : she can always do that
1 : like you know.
3 : move you
2 : to
3 : to you
2 : me, yeah
3 : and
3 : then
1 : but you could also just move to one of these places and shore it up at any time.
2 : that's true.
3 : at any time, yeah, that's true.
1 : any time so i'm gonna come over here,
2 : if
3 : mm
1 : shore this up, then move here
3 : but that means i have two turns, but you
2 : i'm just
3 : both of you so that means that's six
3 : flood cards, so we might lose.
2 : i feel like you should shore this one up and then one of us can get this one, cause it's, cause you'll still if you do one, shore up two, you'll still be on the misty marsh by the end of it.
1 : well
2 : and we're closer to that one
1 : one
1 : shore up
2 : shore it up and then move to misty marsh
3 : that's two.
1 : oh, ok. oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.
3 : well
3 : maybe you should move
3 : towards the
3 : chalice
3 : though,
3 : cause you have two chalice cards.
2 : but she needs to be on the same tile as me in order to give me the card.
1 : yeah i need to
3 : i keep on forgetting that
1 : yeah ok,  one,
1 : and then two,
1 : three
2 : ok, cool, so then you get two of these
1 : and
1 : ooh
2 : oh dang
3 : oh my gosh
2 : alright
3 : you're ready
2 : and then
1 : wait
3 : ok
2 : three of these, wah, wah, wah. breaker's bridge, cliffs of abandon,
1 : 
2 : and caves of ember.
3 : here's caves of ember
1 : ok, looks like we're still alive.
2 : cliffs of abandon
2 : and what was the first one?
2 : breaker's bridge
1 : ok
1 : we are still alive.
2 : ok
2 : cool
3 : and
3 : oh you don't have the sandbag anymore, i forgot.
2 : i know i used it
2 : but i saved howling garden, so
2 : ok
2 : i feel like we should i should shore up temple of the moon
1 : mmhmm
2 : primarily
2 : do we feel good about that?
1 : and then you're gonna hang out over there. you could a you could shore this up
1 : move here
2 : and shore copper gate up
1 : move shore that up
1 : and we'll still be really close
2 : or cliffs of abandon
1 : together.
2 : that's true.
2 : i do think that's a good move.
2 : or should i give
1 : and she could go save any of these with her little
1 : helicopter i mean pilot thing.
2 : it's true
2 : i feel good that you have the helicopter things and in order for you to get all of these anyways you're gonna need to use the helicopter things, do you know what i mean? or at least one of them and a sandbag
2 : ok, so i'm just gonna do that then
2 : or shore this up,
1 : mmhmm
2 : sorry
2 : and then move here and shore this up
2 : ok
1 : yay
2 : alright, so i've gotta get rid of some cards. so i think i don't need these
1 : just give out both of those. yeah
1 : 
2 : ok, and then
2 : silver gate, dunes of deception,
2 : and coral palace.
1 : we're still alive
1 : i love how we're not losing any islands right now.
2 : ok
3 : did you get all of them?
3 : i didn't pay attention.
1 : yeah, i, i this yeah, that one
3 : ok, ok
2 : yeah, ok
3 : so my turn
2 : your turn
2 : so you might wanna think about some shoring some stuff up.
3 : so
1 : we, we got this over here. maybe we got this so, maybe these corners
2 : maybe you wanna fly to some other place
3 : yeah
1 : yeah these corners are like creepy
1 : like these two, maybe. the one's with the treasures on it.
3 : maybe like
2 : i feel, i feel like the stuff in the center is the more, more important
3 : that's the one that
1 : that one
1 : yeah, yeah
3 : cause that's how we're moving around.
2 : right
3 : so, i can fly here,
1 : uh huh
3 : then turn this
3 : around,
2 : mmhmm
3 : then maybe turn
1 : oh yeah
2 : turn cliffs of abandon around, cause that's like our access point.
1 : yeah
2 : we still have whispering garden, even though
3 : i think so, just
1 : oh ok
2 : howling garden is
1 : ok, yeah
2 : and we still have cave of shadows so, yeah, i feel like
2 : our access points are important,
2 : cause you can only fly us around so much.
3 : ok
3 : should i be
3 : so for your next move, you will
1 : i'm gonna trade
2 : hand me the
3 : there's
1 : i'm gonna trade this in first, for the treasure
3 : the
2 : and then hand me that
2 : card too.
1 : hand you this
3 : i would trade that in
3 : for treasure.
1 : i'm giving this to her
3 : so you're gonna first yeah
2 : oh you need to be on a chalice spot in order to trade in
3 : so i guess you
1 : i do?
3 : you would
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : so you could
2 : give me that card
2 : and then move two spots and then on your next turn you could trade in
1 : and then boom, boom
1 : and then
1 : ok, yeah, cause i'll be chilling there. nothing can do anything to me
2 : yeah, it's not
2 : flooded so that's good.
1 : yeah.
3 : ok
1 : oh yeah
1 : alright
3 : cause i have, i have one more move. i was thinking maybe if we could
2 : you could use a helicopter card to fly up but then she would still have to give the card to me if we want to play that.
1 : oh, well this one
3 : fly you
1 : oh no, you don't have to fly me right now, i'm fine.
3 : ok, it's all just
2 : alright, i feel good about that
2 : ok.
3 : alright
3 : so
3 : these two
2 : you have to discard
2 : two cards,
3 : oh jeez
1 : 
2 : so you might as well get rid of the fire and chalice
1 : yeah
3 : yeah, these
1 : yeah
3 : alright
2 : alright
3 : then, three
2 : bronze gate,
2 : tidal palace, oh great.
2 : temple of the sun
1 : 
1 : i mean
1 : i'll still be the 
2 : then where's bronze gate?
2 : it's over here.
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : alright, so
2 : thank you. k i'm gonna get rid of this
3 : you've been trying to do that
1 : and then i'll just move there in two.
1 : someone please help me
2 : or you could move to copper gate and unshore and shore that up. i think that would be a better play cause then you can just hop right over for your next turn
1 : yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : oh my gosh
2 : and it's safe
3 : i didn't think about that, that's good.
1 : yeah, ok
1 : so yeah
2 : ok
1 : thank you
2 : oh no!
1 : don't do that, that's lame. at least i got one of these though!
3 : ah nice, ok
2 : that's true, that's good. ok so hand me the
1 : but we're still on three, ooo
2 : it's true, we're still on three so give me the water's rise card
1 : and then
2 : guess that's done
1 : and then
2 : and then shuffle these. we gotta do that first.
1 : oh yeah
2 : alright
2 : and then you pull three.
1 : ok
1 : bronze gate,
1 : uh coral palace, dunes of deception. huh, oh no
2 : wah, wah, wah
2 : don dunes of deception are also gone and then coral palace is right there.
1 : 
3 : dunes of dec
1 : ok
3 : thanks
3 : wow
2 : alright
1 : ok we're we're really not dying as fast as i thought we were gonna be dying
2 : that's good, that's a good thing i think
2 : ok, so i think i should shore up silver gate, just cause i'm over there, why not?
2 : and then move to temple of the moon and then trade in
3 : yeah
3 : 
2 : unless you want me to give you no i think you should hang on to those cards, maybe use one, and then i can give you this card later.
3 : 
3 : ok
1 : you can use those sandbags soon
2 : bam and
3 : we're getting nervous
1 : we're getting to that point
2 : i don't know what to do with those but you can have them. either put them there or there and i don't know
3 : i think
3 : oh
3 : to capture a treasure we just
2 : you discard the four matching treasure cards while in the corresponding .i mean it doesn't say where to discard them to
2 : oh to the treasure card discard pile
3 : ok
2 : ok, cool. so now we have this, that's good. we're two we only need one more guys
1 : yay
2 : ok
2 : and that's my turn, so then
3 : so, ok, so it's my turn. oh
2 : still gotta do that and one,
2 : two,
2 : three. ok, so copper gate,
1 : we have like ten minutes.
2 : temple of the sun and tidal palace.
3 : so copper gate
2 : temple of the sun is now gone.
2 : and tidal palace. so aren't we glad that we shored that up last turn?
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : uh, ok
2 : and, that is now my turn.
1 : is that all for you
1 : who's turn?
3 : yeah, so now it's my turn.
2 : yeah
1 : oh ok
3 : so
3 : your special talent is you can
3 : give
3 : each of us two
2 : a card without being
2 : on the same tile as you.
3 : ok
3 : ok, that's it
1 : you can a you can also go diagonal, you haven't done that yet oh you can't? you can go diagonal
2 : no, i can't go diagonal, nnhmm that's the explorer.
3 : oh, ok
2 : yeah
1 : the empty person, you're so helpful
2 : ok so i think
3 : so, let's see
2 : if you can sandbags tidal palace i think that would be a really good move because we need her to trade in there.
1 : mmhmm
3 : k
3 : so
3 : sandbag
3 : that's not an action
2 : ok, so that doesn't even count as a turn, so that's good.
2 : umm
3 : i don't really i'm not really useful for these
2 : yeah, cause if she's gonna do that then it doesn't really matter.
1 : you should do another you should do another helicopter and shore something else up.
3 : so
3 : well i can shore these two up, as well.
1 : oh shore both of those up, both of them
2 : that might be a good idea
2 : cause they're close to fool's landing, if we like get desperate, you know
3 : mmhmm
3 : so
1 : 
3 : one, two, and then maybe i should move so i'll turn these two over so it's two actions and then maybe i should move
3 : here cause i'd be near
2 : you could move to fool's landing, cause after she gets that one we only need three treasures and then we can get out of here
1 : or you can move down
3 : k, so yeah, that works, so
3 : turn this over
3 : oop sorry
3 : well it doesn't matter.
3 : ok
2 : so, is that three turns? did you do anything before that?
3 : umm i
2 : you just sandbagged
3 : oh, yeah, so it's three, yeah.
2 : ok, which doesn't count, so you're good.
1 : ok
3 : so, i have another sandbag and then a
3 : chalice or whatever.
2 : alrighty
3 : oh, let's see
2 : and then three of these
3 : so i have five
3 : cards or six. so i'll get rid of
2 : ok, so you just discard the chalice or something
1 : and let go of the yeah
1 : yeah
2 : umm whispering garden, caves of ember,
2 : and
1 : garden
2 : howling garden.
3 : oh we lost caves of ember
1 : aw
2 : we lost howling garden as well. man, rough times. ok
2 : caves of ember, howling garden, they're outta here.
2 : ok
1 : ok my
3 : ok, well i'm glad i'm on fool's
1 : ok so, is it my turn?
1 : so then i'm gonna shore this up
1 : and then
1 : trade this in for the treasure, and then what else should i do?
3 : you don't have to shore it up, i don't think. you can just
2 : i think it's a good idea if she does though
1 : yeah, cause i can get back. like if not, i'm gonna be stuck
2 : i mean you would have to swim, which wouldn't be the end of the world
1 : yeah
2 : but, cause twilight hollow is just hanging out
1 : oh
3 : that's a yeah, i don't know if you need to do that
2 : maybe just move to tidal palace, trade it in, and then
3 : you could move back
2 : you could shore yeah you could move back. i think that's a good call
3 : cause otherwise you'd be
2 : you could potentially be stranded if this one
2 : died and that one
1 : so move
1 : and then
2 : and trade it in
1 : here you go
1 : and then yes!
2 : nice
1 : and the
2 : and then, move back. yeah, i think that's good.
1 : and then
2 : ok, two treasure cards, good. no water's rise
1 : ok, awesome.
2 : and three of these
1 : and then three of these.
2 : temple of the moon,
2 : breaker's bridge and silver gate.
1 : ok
2 : ok, cool.
2 : so i think
3 : so now you guys have to move
2 : we just need to get to fool's landing and get outta here
2 : so
1 : i mean we have this one too
3 : at the end of the day i could fly you guys, yeah.
2 : cause we don't need to get that
3 : cause we've
1 : when
2 : we'll only need three
1 : oh
2 : i know, right?
2 : ok, so
1 : i got a helicopter
2 : so i guess i'll just move towards fool's landing and you can always fly me in if need be
1 : 
3 : yeah, me too 
3 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : so i'm just gonna go one
2 : oh should i uh shore some stuff up in the mean time or does it not matter.
1 : i mean, no, we all have helicopters and stuff
3 : no, cause you're straight
2 : one, two,
2 : three
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
2 : ok, so then you can go
3 : so then i think i can just oh well you have to
1 : do
1 : 
2 : oh, i still have to do this
3 : we're so excited to leave
1 : they're still gonna try to kill us. oh my gosh i could well i can swim though
2 : water's rise ok, yeah, we're we only got six minutes so we gotta, we gotta book it
1 : i can swim though
3 : ok
2 : ok, so now we're up,
2 : these get shuffled,
2 : bam
2 : one, two,
2 : three,
2 : four. so coral palace, silver gate,
1 : silver gate's gone.
2 : breaker's bridge, whispering garden. k, they're both gone.
1 : breaker's bridge is gone
1 : and
2 : so is silver gate.
1 : we got all of them?
2 : and coral palace is right here and that's the only one that's still there.
1 : ok
3 : k
1 : alright
2 : ok
2 : so now it's your turn
3 : so now i can
1 : this we're just getting to fool's landing?
3 : move one or more pawns at can't i just move you guys?
1 : oh yeah
2 : so you can do that whenever, so you can just move us both right now
3 : so that's
2 : with those two cards.
1 : let's just do that
3 : yeah, cause this isn't an action
3 : so
2 : so
3 : no we need one to leave the island
1 : we
2 : oh, that's true
1 : and what's the
2 : so you should fly her in and shore this tile up so i don't die.
1 : and then
1 : yeah,
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : so that's one.
3 : action.
1 : and then shore this one
3 : or that's not an action, that was just this.
2 : right, it doesn't even count.
1 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : and shore that bad boy up so i don't die.
3 : shore this
1 : and
3 : umm
2 : and then
1 : and then just be safe till then.
2 : maybe use a sandbag to shore something else up so the island doesn't disappear before our eyes.
3 : we can use yeah
1 : yeah a sandbag
3 : alright
2 : i feel good about that
1 : oh my gosh we're gonna survive you guys
3 : it's pointless, so then, four. ok
2 : ok
1 : you have to get rid of a card i think
2 : oh no she doesn't, cause the pilot one is her normal card. ok, copper gate,
3 : i have five,
1 : oh my gosh i keep forgetting that.
3 : i can move this to the side. i know it's confusing.
2 : temple of the moon,
2 : tidal palace,
1 : it's gone
2 : and cliffs of abandon.
2 : temple of the moon
1 : tidal palace is 
2 : tidal palace is gone
1 : 
1 : and then cities of, of
3 : no i just turned this around, yeah.
2 : oh, you just turned it over? and then copper gate,
2 : where's that?
2 : right here.
1 : ok
2 : so those two
3 : did we do four?
2 : are gone. oh no
2 : it was cliffs of abandon, coral
1 : that was four.
2 : or copper gate, tidal palace, and then that one.
1 : yeah that was our four
2 : ok
2 : and then it's your turn.
1 : ok
1 : so i'm red.
2 : and you don't need to do anything, right?
1 : i don't need to do anything
3 : oh can't you
3 : helicopter lift someone
2 : you could helicopter
3 : or does that mean just you?
3 : wait
1 : i can helicopter lift you, you, and then we're done
2 : you could helicopter me in. i mean it doesn't matter, cause i can just walk there.
3 : yeah
1 : i mean it we could just be done right now.
2 : no, cause we still have to have her fly us out.
3 : but if you don't take any moves then do you still have to pull cards?
2 : yeah
3 : ok, so maybe
1 : i can helicopter you
2 : maybe
1 : helicopter lift you in and then we can just get her to helicopter everyone out.
2 : that's true, but everything's gonna flood around us so we just have to keep that in mind.
1 : do we need to keep this island?
1 : is that a part of the game?
2 : i guess not
3 : no
2 : no, i think that's fine. ok, so just helicopter me in
1 : it's just getting out right?
1 : ok
1 : yeah 
2 : bam
2 : and then
3 : k, so
2 : that's fine.
3 : are you done?
2 : and then yeah, just pull
3 : it's up to you
1 : ok, well
3 : you have two more moves, i guess.
3 : or three
1 : oh i still have
1 : mm
3 : but there's nowhere to
2 : but there's nothing around you to shore up
1 : i get ok, so that was one that wasn't even a move.
2 : that was one move
3 : that wasn't an even a move
1 : that wasn't a move. i can come over here, shore this, shore this
2 : and that up and then walk back
1 : then come back.
1 : yeah
2 : ok, let do that, yeah.
1 : uh red
2 : can we not do that since we pulled a treasure card already?
2 : alright
3 : oh sorry
2 : that's fine.
1 : wait if you just
1 : what would
3 : i, i pulled it too fast.
2 : it doesn't matte.
1 : oh ok
2 : alright, misty marsh is flipped over, watchtower is flipped over,
2 : you guys wanna get those?
2 : observatory is flipped over,
2 : and cave of shadows is flipped over.
3 : i think i missed the first ok.
1 : why they doing this to us?
2 : ok
2 : alright
1 : someone needs to shh we can shore those.
2 : alright so then i can shore
1 : all of this.
2 : that's my first action, that's my second action, and then i'm just gonna call it.
1 : yeah
2 : water's rise, that's fine.
2 : it's crunch time, folks
2 : alright
2 : cliffs of abandon, coral palace, copper gate,
2 : tidal palace.
2 : k, cliffs of abandon,
2 : copper gate,
2 : tidal palace,
1 : the other one i don't think we have that
2 : and coral palace, right here.
1 : oh, we still oh we do have that
2 : whoops
1 : ok
2 : ok, so now we're good and now it is your turn.
3 : i'll take this
1 : and you can
3 : and the coral palace
1 : you can shore these, you can shore these two up before we go, you know, just to save the earth a little bit
2 : no coral palace is still there
3 : oh
3 : i wanna leave
2 : yeah, let's get outta here, let's get outta here, seriously.
3 : ok so, where do we
3 : go?
2 : we just fly away, right?
1 : can we just go now?
2 : you just put that there and we're outta here
1 : and then
2 : tada
1 : oh we are winners with two minutes to spare
2 : oh man that was intense
1 : winners. it wasn't as bad as i though it was cause everyone was like
3 : that was
3 : that was fun
3 : yeah
1 :
