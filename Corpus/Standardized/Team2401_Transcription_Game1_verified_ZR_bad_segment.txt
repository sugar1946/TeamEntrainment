2 : so you have to choose three actions
1 : right  right umm
1 : i will
2 : so remember all these cards are in here already
1 : wait so i can move right?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : i will move
1 : and i can
2 : wait
2 : that's too many
1 : i can shore up to two cards
3 : yeah
2 : oh i see in one turn.
1 : yeah and then i moved
2 : ok
1 : umm so two can you pass me two cards?
2 : sure
3 : shh
1 : 
3 : don't you wanted to shore up
3 : the one with the treasure because if that sinks we won't be able to get it.
1 : can i go back and do that?
3 : ah i don't know.
2 : i can do it next turn. i don't think that you're allowed to go back and
1 : oh ok.
3 : oh yeah i guess it matters because she can
2 : we do?
1 : ok.
1 : oh no.
2 : oh no.
2 : and don't forget to draw your
1 : ok, that would go back in the treasure
2 : flood yeah
1 : pile right
1 : umm 
2 : so you have to draw three of those
1 : two
2 : oh yeah equal to the water level
3 : oh we have to shuffle first.
1 : right
2 : crap
1 : this or that
3 : now those yeah, that's of the six yeah
1 : that ok
1 : and just put it here?
3 : yeah
2 : alright
1 : there's two
2 : what are we lookin at?
2 : alright this is sunken and that's sunken as well.
1 : perfect
2 : no it's sunken you gotta
3 : oh right. yeah put you over here.
2 : like take it off and put it in there.
1 : alright so is it your turn?
2 : i think
2 : yes.
2 : so i'm gonna
2 : move
2 : here
1 : oh discard them
3 : yeah since they're gone so
1 : ok
3 : can you only shore up umm things you're adjacent to or just like anything? no for her power. oh ok.
2 : yes
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : umm
1 : i'm not sure
2 : so can i
1 : up, down, left right it doesn't say any exceptions to that so i'm assuming not
3 : ok
2 : shore up this one.
1 : you can shore up that one.
2 : wait
2 : we're all in agreeance
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : i just want to be sure cause you know we can't go back and do things
3 : right so that's like two right?
2 : and then
2 : that's two actions.
3 : you two should always be next to each other because then you can
3 : send cards to each other and then
2 : i can send cards no matter what
3 : or she can send cards to you and then you can send cards to me and i can go anywhere on the map
2 : i'm thinking i should move down here so that
2 : i can at least shore up this next turn
1 : i mean it's in the far side does it even matter?
3 : no that's not necessary
2 : unless you can you can land
3 : no these one's sorry. they dont't matter if they're shored up or not
1 : necessary
2 : ok well
1 : yeah, as long as they're like within
2 : then
2 : you want me to just move with her
1 : fool's landing
3 : as long as you're next to her it doesn't matter
2 : so where should i we move?
1 : then that should be fine, but i mean now it doesn't really matter i think.
1 : just
3 : yeah i'm just sure. that's fine.
1 : have a pick
2 : ok cause i have to take three actions so
3 : no you don't have to
2 : oh
3 : yeah you can take zero so
1 : yeah up to three actions
3 : yeah
2 : so these are my two
2 : cards
2 : and
1 : just two?
2 : draw two of these
2 : we are sinking the lost lagoon, so that's gone
3 : that was that one.
1 : lost lagoon.
1 : oh ok.
2 : so
2 : ok sink that as well as this
2 : and
2 : breaker's bridge is.
2 : ahh
2 : sunken
2 : so now it's your go
3 : alright
3 : umm
3 : so
3 : hmm
3 : hmm
3 : i'm trying to think if
2 : i mean you might as well just fly over here and just shore it up. there's not really much
3 : no that we don't have to shore it that one up
3 : we don't have to shore up unecessary ones, but i was just thinking
3 : if i could either like move you guys
3 : with this thing
3 : or
1 : the two to fool's landing
3 : no into umm
2 : i mean it dones't matter now because we don't have a whole bunch of
3 : on the same tile
1 : the treasures yeah
2 : cards
3 : oh yeah so
1 : so you're  it to get the treasure
2 : so we might as well try to keep as many
2 : things on the board
2 : as we can so we can still move around
1 : that's true
3 : yeah
1 : so that's why you want
3 : well this doesn't help you move anywhere
1 : i mean
3 : but
1 : yeah
3 : yeah umm
1 : is that a treasure card right?
3 : huh?
1 : it's not a treasures card?
3 : ah no
1 : that one.
3 : cause i think we can see it so
1 : ok
3 : oh wait so we can only, do we draw it first?
1 : you dont have to take an action if you don't
3 : oh yeah after
1 : want to
3 : umm
3 : i guess i might as well just
3 : take two to here for when i eventually give you some of these
1 : ok.
3 : yeah ok then
1 : two cards.
3 : yeah
3 : so water rise, so that goes up
1 : oh no!
3 : this  for the draw pile
1 : is it three?
3 : yeah ok
1 : do those go back in the pile?
1 : the water rise card
1 : once you use them.
2 : no this just gets shuffled and put back in here.
3 : umm no
3 : yeah and it's just one so
1 : the water rise cards though i mean
2 : i don't think so
1 : really?
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : so it's just like that
2 : so it's
3 : yeah and then i got this. i'll give it to you evetually i guess
2 : yeah
1 : alright
3 : ok so i guess i'm done
2 : no you have to draw
2 : three
3 : oh right, how many? no three right yeah. ok.
1 : two cards
1 : three, three you know?
2 : three
2 : so this is definitely gone now
3 : yeah so that's gone.
2 : can we
2 : put that in the thing over there
3 : yeah and then whispering garden is flooded.
1 : it's flooded?
3 : and then
3 : so it's
3 : breaker's bridge
1 : where is it?
2 : umm we just discarded it
1 : we do whispering garden, oh you took that one out too?
3 : you didn't? ah whoops yeah
2 : which, what was the other one that
1 : breaker's bridge
2 : you drew
3 : breakers bridge, yeah
1 : ah
3 : and then that
2 : but you drew three cards
3 : whispering garden yeah
2 : so what was the third one?
3 : it was
3 : wait what'd i do with it? was it
3 : cities of abandon?
3 : maybe i think i mean have accidentally discarded that
2 : so we're on a sunken tile now?
1 : can we move from there or can we stay there?
2 : you don't move until it umm
3 : yeah so whoops so this goes over there.
2 : floods
3 : these are discarded
1 : so if it's flooding then you don't you can still stay there.
2 : if it's sunken then yeah you can stay there.
3 : yeah
1 : eh, ok.
2 : i mean you can also unflood it.
1 : sure, now i can yeah.
2 : umm
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah ok.
1 : so let me do that. that's one.
1 : this one  is one.
1 : umm
1 : and
1 : move shore
1 : i just move here for two.
1 : so that's three actions right?
3 : i think so yeah.
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : can you give me two cards?
2 : and you draw
2 : three of these.
1 : so now i
2 : you have how many cards?
1 : no more than
1 : you can only have five ok. yeah i am still good i think.
2 : ok
2 : ok.
1 : umm and three.
1 : ah temple of the moon
1 : oh don't we have to shuffle that?
2 : no not unless you get a water rise card.
1 : ok.
1 : umm.
1 : howling garden
1 : ok that one.
3 : oh yeah
1 : and iron gate
3 : ah right there. ok.
1 : ok.
3 : so
2 : umm
2 : so it's my turn now.
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm.
3 : so we need to get
3 : this card
2 : yeah
3 : to her
3 : and this one to you
3 : and then the yellow one to me or you? yeah.
1 : yeah yeah
1 : to you probably.
3 : ok so.
1 : umm
1 : i can't give it until i have like until it's my
2 : right.
1 : next turn right?
1 : ok.
3 : no
3 : so, oh yeah so you're there.
3 : so if you moved here that's one.
3 : oh wait you'd have to give it yeah
1 : you also don't have to take a turn
1 : you can take up to three turns if you just want to stay where you are.
3 : yeah
3 : yeah fly
1 : so i would just
2 : i can give you these two.
3 : is that one turn or two?
2 : i mean but
1 : be i because i would be more than five but you can give itto him definitely.
1 : though why would he need that.
2 : oh i see
2 : i see i can just wait for you to turn and give that to me
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
2 : umm so
2 : pretty much.
1 : i mean are you at
1 : cause that's yours right?
1 : that thing was is it called?
2 : so i get three turns?
2 : right?
3 : umm
1 : one, two, three yeah, so you can move to that place
2 : so
2 : i think that i will move here, shore that up, and then just
2 : move back to where i was?
2 : is that ok?
1 : or you can
2 : 
3 : i think you should move here and shore that up, so in case we need to like exchange stuff. yeah.
2 : oh i see i didn't realize.
2 : so
1 : does it have to be shored?
1 : oh is
1 : isn't it already up?
2 : is that's not i'm, that's not
1 : that's not flooded.
2 : flooded yeah
3 : oh that's just blue yeah ok.
1 : yeah, no you can move to temple umm of the sun because that's where
2 : yeah
1 : this treasure is
1 : so just stay there.
2 : or you can move to temple of the moon and shore it up at the same time.
1 : would yeah
1 : yeah
2 : ok so
3 : or you don't even have to move there you can just
2 : one two
1 : stay
1 : oh that would be nice to just be at the treasure place
3 : alright me too, ah yeah yeah.
1 : yeah.
2 : ah i'm having some struggles guys sorry.
3 : umm.
1 : ok.
3 : ok
2 : alright.
2 : so i draw these two.
1 : two yeah
2 : another sandbags.
2 : another
1 : ok.
2 : chalice and
2 : i draw three of these. water's at three.
3 : ah, ah
1 : we need four.
1 : three
2 : yeah.
1 : we need
2 : so let us sink cave of embers
1 : four of these cards.
2 : right here.
3 : ok.
2 : copper gate.
1 : silver gate
2 : right here
2 : and crimson forest.
2 : alright
3 : ok.
3 : how, how many cards do you have?
2 : one, two, three four five
2 : crap
1 : oh one, two, three , four, five, six
2 : umm
2 : because i'm a messenger, i can give one of my cards away though right?
3 : not now maybe? i don't know.
1 : oh as ah
2 : like if i draw
2 : two, can i just give one of those away?
1 : what's your thing you say?
3 : yeah.
2 : oh i see. per action.
2 : mm.
1 : all of a sudden.
3 : and we can't like undo anything right?
1 : no.
2 : right, no so.
1 : so just hand it off.
2 : i
2 : i can't. it's an action. yeah.
3 : just discard a sandbag right?
1 : or you could
1 : oh right.
3 : no.
1 : wouldn't that be helpful?
2 : oh
3 : i think.
3 : since we already have a sandbag, it would be more helpful
3 : right, since we need we need these.
1 : ah
3 : and we already have three so.
1 : true
1 : so i  yeah
2 : so what do you guys want to do?
3 : i would say discard the sandbag
1 : just
2 : ok.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : hmm.
3 : ok so yeah that's my turn. alright.
3 : umm.
3 : mmhmm.
2 : you should probably
2 : unsink the two things that have like
3 : yeah
2 : things on them
3 : umm so let me think
1 : you should yes, you should unsink your own thing.
2 : so you're on one. so you can unsink that one.
3 : yeah
2 : use an action to fly to the other one and then sink that one. that's three.
3 : yeah but most we think about
3 : what we can unsink as well as
3 : using my turns to like get out the cards to the right people.
3 : like i should be giving over this and she should be giving me this gold thing.
1 : oh.
3 : right? so,
1 : i well you can't give anything to me right now.
1 : because i would go over five cards.
2 : cause she has five.
3 : yeah
3 : but i could bring.
3 : both of you here.
1 : two?
3 : to this place after i unflood it.
1 : umm
1 : but i mean we are close kind of
1 : no not really to get our card
2 : you can't bring both of us cause we're not on the same tile.
3 : two.
3 : yeah
3 : umm
1 : they have to be on the same tile, i think.
2 : wait we have to be on the same tile if you want to move two people.
3 : do you? move one or more pawns on, oh yeah ah well
2 : yeah
1 : yeah so yeah
1 : i would say just stay at your
1 : treasure place.
1 : and then sink whatever you can unsink.
3 : yeah
2 : i mean eventually we're gonna get a water's rise card. and then we are gonna have to shuffle these and then there's a chance that we'll lose those.
3 : oh yeah well definitely, ok. so i'll just. that's one turn.
2 : two treasure things.
3 : and then umm, if i moved you here.
3 : and
2 : i'm here because i have
3 : oh no.
1 : i can oh no it's me.
2 : wait these.
3 : yeah i know but
3 : we still
3 : i mean everyone that has the right cards cause it won't matter where we are. so first we need to get the cards before you know being wherever right?
2 : right.
3 : oh so that's one turn. oh i forgot this was time too.
3 : ah
1 : we have twenty minutes. i think we'll be fine.
3 : yeah
1 : how manys did you just take one action?
3 : so
3 : yeah so i think i should
3 : move
3 : you so then you could give me
3 : umm, the lions and then i could give you this and then you would just move back
1 : lions head.
2 : but yout can't give her anything because she
1 : are you gonna give that? you can't give it to me yet.
3 : oh yeah, or is she, i would just give her that. yeah.
1 : we'd have to wait until my turn.
2 : has five cards.
1 : yeah
2 : she has five cards, so she'd have to discard something.
3 : oh yeah.
1 : that would be one of my actions.
3 : right.
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah and i pick more cards anyways.
2 : you sould just unsink the one that's
3 : this?
2 : the one that has a thing on it.
3 : oh right.
1 : the treasure.
3 : ok i guess would be that.
1 : yeah.
3 : that's three.
1 : ok.
1 : there you go.
2 : so that's one action.
3 : umm, you can't
3 : don't you have to be next to me?
2 : oh you have to draw these too.
1 : draw two, oh you haven't even done that. ok.
3 : oh yeah.
2 : and
2 : you need three flood cards right?
3 :   yeah
2 : one, two
2 : three
3 : coral palace
3 : oh here.
1 : coral palace.
3 : ok so that's over there. umm.
3 : dunes of deception. right there.
3 : and then silver gate.
2 : yes right there yeah.
3 : yeah it's that one ok.
1 : ok.
1 : so i have two of these. so if i give them to oh, one, two, three, four, five cards?
3 : mmhmm.
1 : oh i can't give it to you now.
2 : hmm.
1 : that's ok yeah because i could have given it to you and you could have had the treasure if you move to
2 : why don't you give me your
2 : blue one.
1 : yeah.
2 : and unsink this blue one. that's your three actions. are you ok with that? before you do them.
3 : wait don't you have to be next to each other to give cards?
2 : oh i forget. i have to be.
1 : really?
2 : yeah you are right?
3 : yeah.
2 : i can give cards to anybody but you can't.
3 : yeah so let's oh yeah you
1 : oh it has to be on the same tile ah gosh.
2 : yeah you have to be on the same tile yeah
3 : ok so.
2 : umm
1 : i definitely
1 : i have to discard
2 : right?
1 : somethin
2 : before you draw. do you want to draw first and then discard?
3 : ok
2 : two
1 : oh i can draw first
2 : i don't know
2 : there's nothing in the rules that says don't draw first
2 : can you shh
1 : if you ever have six or more you must immediately choose and discard the extra card to the treasure.
3 : yeah so the
2 : yeah
1 : so then we draw one.
2 : why don't you draw both of them. it says six or more.
1 : ok ok never mind.
2 : and then just discard whichever one.
2 : ok well you have to
2 :  that?
1 : still three guys umm.
2 : so this gets
1 : and so this obviously gets
1 : to go over there.
2 : so you just need to decide between that
3 : oh we have to shuffle too. shuffle put them back on.
2 : what you want to discard?
1 : umm so i've
3 : and then so wait what are the treasures? what did you get?
1 : i got two lion things.
3 : ok so we have three lions, four fire and then
1 : yeah.
3 : do you have one of these things? and then four of those. so that's what we're
1 : yeah i do so four
2 : i have the other two.
3 : we're going four
1 : we'd have to get on the same tiles guys.
3 : oh wait. yeah.
1 : umm.
2 : so
3 : so wait four of these, four of this and then three lions and three
1 : three lions definitely
3 : cups goblets whatever
1 : yeah
3 : and then so we'll just pick out of those two.  which we go for.
2 : so which one is the one that we have four of all together? this one?
1 : so since we don't
1 : umm
2 : is this the only one? this one and that one.
3 : yeah that one and this one.
1 : this, yeah this one, this one.
3 : so we have to pick.
1 : and this one?
2 : so
1 : no we don't have this one. i can
2 : no
2 : so discard either that one or the lion one.
3 : that's three. so which one is
1 : one, two, three.
3 : better for us?
1 : can i discard more than
1 : two? i wouldn't want to do that actually.
2 : good.
1 : if i like discard it would it go back in the pile?
2 : no i think it goes in the discarded
2 : treasure card.
1 : ok
1 : so it's not as easy as just like giving you card umm
1 : so i'll just discard this for now i guess.
2 : ok.
2 : and then you have to draw three of these.
2 : oh wait let me put the thing back on first.
1 : wait, did i make a move?
3 : yeah.
3 : i'm not where were you? oh there.
1 : i didn't make, yeah i didn't move.
3 : no you didn't do any moves.
2 : you
1 : oh ord
1 : oh we had to do in order.
3 : in order so you've you already done
1 : oh really?
3 : yeah i think so.
1 : ok.
1 : though i didn't want to move anyways or i could have.
1 : could have unsunck those things.
3 : yeah.
1 : ah
1 : ok
2 : we have to draw.
2 : three
1 : i did that.
2 : you drew three of these?
1 : yeah.
2 : already?
3 : yeah
2 : oh ok oh crap
3 : what was 
1 : wait didn't i?
2 : i don't think so
2 : can i use this at any time? does this it has to be my turn?
3 : it has to be your turn and it has to be before you draw those.
1 : alright
2 : i see
3 : yeah
1 : oh before she does ok this is gone
3 : ok
1 : umm whispering garden
1 : is gone.
1 : or flooded.
1 : copper gate
1 : is gone
3 : ok
1 : what i forget?
2 : ok.
3 : ok so
3 : what can we
2 : so it's my turn so i'm not
1 : wait, wait ,wait draw flood cards equal to the water level yeah
3 : you're over there
2 : yeah i don't have fancy powers like i can't move people. umm
3 : well you should definintely use that sandbag
2 : right.
2 : so i'm thinking that i should move one, two right?
3 : for this and this
2 : well my third action should be to unshore this and then i use my sandbag which doesn't count as an action to unshore this?
3 : that can unshore two, the sandbag. oh it's just one?
1 : no it's one.
2 : it's just one.
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah
3 : and can you also
3 : unshore, oh no that's you, that's your thing right?
2 : so
2 : i mean we have like fifteen minutes.
3 : yeah.
3 : ok.
1 : oh
3 : so you should not
3 : unshore this and you should just use that two
3 : cause we're not going after these. these are all just gonna be discards anyway.
2 : what?
3 : so
1 : should you move to the same tile as me or can we should we try to be on the same tile because if we're gonna exchange these anyways or we're trying to?
3 : yeah
3 : you two yeah you guys should try to get
1 : you
1 : it would be covenient to stay on the same tile.
3 : yeah
2 : ok well
3 : but she can't get to an adjacent tile
1 : right
2 : right either way i won't have three so i think i should just
1 : right
1 : unshore
2 : i mean i can unshore both of them.
1 : isn't that one of your powers?
1 : what's your power?
2 : i mean i can move to like
2 : this is shore up any one tile on the island so you don't have to be on it
1 : oh ok.
2 : can shore up any one tile before it sinks
2 : but can't be used ahhh
2 : oh yeah
3 : ok i
1 : since we were trying to use
1 : this
2 : right.
1 : ah actually we don't have four yet
2 : i mean i can move here and unshore that
1 : one, two, three. you'd have to stay here.
3 : i think
2 : i mean i could stay here and unshore it and then i could use this to unshore it.
1 : yeah
3 : i
3 : don't think that's the best thinks. we still don't have anything
1 : we don't have to  one more card yet for that.
1 : so it doesn't even do us any good.
3 : yeah i think we should
3 : 
3 : she should send both of these to me
3 : and then i can just travel you know with my power or whatever
3 : and then i'll have three
1 : where would you go?
3 : and then i can go here and then you can
1 : wait
3 : and then
1 : wouldn't you want one more? oh.
3 : and then you would give that to me
1 : ok so the next time
3 : and then i would give this to you?
1 : i couldn't give it to you yeah cause you have to be on the same
1 : place as i am to exchange any cards.
3 : i thought you two would just be next to each other.
1 : typically
1 : two
2 : no you have to be on the same tile
1 : yeah
3 : oh ok well then you would just move there too or
1 : yeah i would use one action to do that.
3 : yeah
3 : so
1 : change your move
3 : you should give those two to me and then play this to
3 : maybe unsink something or do something else
1 : wait which one are you talking about.
3 : this one
1 : i only have one
3 : and she has two
2 : right
1 : oh so are we, are we in your
2 : i can give, i can give them to him
1 : so i know
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : so giving two cards, is that two actions?
1 : yeah giving the single card is one. so
3 : ah wait
2 : right, right this is two actions
3 : i have five so i would have to discard this
1 : right
1 : when it's your turn so you can't do anything now gosh
3 : and this yeah no i would do that now. immediately once you got more of them that
2 : wait when are you allowed to discard?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : oh because it's your turn you could pass it down
3 : so i would have to discard these
3 : and i would get
2 : so is that what you want to do?
3 : yeah it's the only thing really to do.
2 : ok
3 : umm ok, so that's here and then that's
2 : i can give you these two for two actions
3 : ok
1 : three so make
2 : i can
1 : ok yeah that makes sense
2 : unsink
2 : i guess this one cause this is one the one that's like in immediate
3 : yeah
2 : danger and i s
2 : i that's it, no i have one more action left
1 : yeah
2 : because i have three
3 : no cause this counts as an action and then
2 : one two
2 : this doesn't count as an action
1 : three
1 : one two and then you just unsunk oh and that's one right? so that's three?
2 : right so
1 : so you're done.
2 : any request where to move?
3 : so either you could unsink this
1 : wait can you still move though?
2 : yes
1 : wasn't that three actions?
2 : one, two this doesn't count as an action so i still have one more left.
3 : yeah
1 : didn't you unshore this?
3 : that's that
1 : oh with the ok ok.
3 : so you can either unshore this or move closer to you know where we'll be.
3 : because unshoring this even if it's not useful
2 : yeah
3 : will still
3 : like
3 : keep putting it back in the pile to stop other cards from being flooded.
2 : ok sure.
3 : so
3 : yeah
2 : you can just move me later.
2 : and then i draw these two
3 : actually i can't cause i discarded that.
2 : oops sorry.
3 : so
2 : no but isn't that your power? oh no it's not? ok.
1 : how come?
3 : no i just move myself yeah.
2 : so now i have three of these and umm
3 : ok.
2 : i have to draw one, two.
2 : three cards right? yeah.
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah
2 : cave of embers
1 : oh
1 : that right there.
3 : ah here.
2 : coral palace god dammit
2 : i told you i should have sunk
2 : i should have unsunken this one. it's gone.
3 : what's that?
1 : oh it's gone.
3 : oh this.
1 : ok.
2 : can you discard that with it?
2 : cliffs of abandon.
3 : wait
3 : ok yeah.
1 : this one's gone?
1 : cliffs of abandon, umm
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : that was. was that the only treasure card for it or no?
2 : no there's tidal
1 : one
1 : there's one more
2 : palace
1 : ok
2 : but you cannot get to it unless you are the pilot or unless you have one of these now, because we don't have nanything
2 : next to it
2 : and we can't move diagonally unless you went all the way down like but
1 : you could
1 : no
1 : if you got some more there then yeah yeah.
2 : that's a lot of turns.
2 : it's your go.
1 : we don't have another card for that anyways
3 : ok.
2 : one, two, three four i'm good
3 : ok. we have to be on the same tile right? to exchange cards? ok.
1 : mmhmm.
3 : so that's one.
2 : but she can't give anything to you because it's
2 : it's
2 : not her turn.
3 : yeah
1 : not yet.
1 : yeah so i would yeah
2 : right.
3 : that's fine she'll just discard the lions and then i'll give these to you that's.
3 : that's three turns.
2 : i see
3 : ok.
2 : ok.
1 : you're giving oh you're giving that to me too?
3 : yup
2 : so that because you're on that so next turn you can
2 : grab a treasure
2 : and you can give him one of those.
1 : i can discard.
1 : i have to discard these two
3 : yep
2 : right
1 : so now it's my turn or have you
1 : picked the flooding?

3 : yeah
2 : so go ahead and
1 : sure true
3 : discard that

2 : and grab a treasure
2 : so i believe that's one action

1 : grab oh grab a new treasure.
2 : yeah.
2 : so we put these in the discard pile?
1 : yeah yeah yeah umm
2 : umm
2 : and then
3 : and move to figurine in front of you. oh yeah ok.
2 : give him one yeah.
1 : so now you have four.
3 : ok.
1 : umm and do
2 : and you have another action if you want.
1 : i could shore things.
1 : right.
2 : sure might as well.
3 : yeah
1 : is that one of my powers anywhere?
3 : can you shore this up?
2 : is it
2 : anywhere or just adjacent?
1 : ah
1 : up
1 : to
1 : up to two tiles
3 : anywhere or only adjacent?
2 : or adjacent.
1 : oh
2 : didn't say
1 : it doesn't say
3 : on your power card it doesn't say?
1 : so i guess

1 : shore up two tiles for one action
3 : what's it say on the opposite side?
2 : wait a second
1 : shore up
1 : on or adjacent tiles.
3 : oh it has to be adjacent.

3 : i guess
1 : mm
1 : just do one.
1 : there's no point in moving.
1 : right?
3 : umm right.
2 : and then you only have one action. you might as well just shore it up just
1 : yeah there's nothing else.
2 : put the cards back in the deck.
1 : ok
1 : so can you give me two.
1 : ok.
3 : ok.
2 : ok and then
2 : yeah
1 : bronze gate
3 : ok so we've basically won then.
1 : have we?
3 : yeah cause she'll just shore things up her turn.
1 : dunes of deception
3 : then i'll capture this and she can send me that and i'll capture it again and then we'll just keep shoring things up and leave with that.
1 : ok.
1 : umm
1 : iron gate.
1 : where's iron gate
3 : oh here, so it's gone? discard. ok.

3 : and then i get that
3 : and then i fly to like, what is this? to like here

2 : your power is to fly?
1 : can you take her with you like to there?
