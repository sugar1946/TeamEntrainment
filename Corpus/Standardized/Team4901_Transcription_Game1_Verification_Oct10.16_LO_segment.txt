1 : no, look in there
3 : ok
3 : and those go back.
1 : ok.
1 : umm
2 : i mean you should've used a helicopter to move her
2 : over here.
3 : well that doesn't take up a turn, right?
3 : so it doesn't count as an action?
2 : no
1 : oh, it doesn't.
2 : yeah
3 : so i can
3 : where you wanna go?
1 : oh i would like to go here, please, right here where she is

1 : i'll just move here
1 : can i shore up things?
1 : they only they only have to be next to me right?
1 : or i can do any
1 : ok
3 : i think they have to be adjacent
2 : yeah, yeah
1 : adjacent to me, oh
3 : so i don't think you can do that.
1 : mm
1 : ok
1 : i can't do anything, then i'll just

2 : and whispering gardens
1 : hmm
2 : yeah, ok.
2 : ok, your turn.
3 : ok, well
3 : i'm gonna
3 : shore up
3 : breaker's bridge
3 : and
3 : whispering gardens.
3 : wait
1 : hmm?
2 : those are like two actions
3 : does moving a yeah it's two actions, i'm wanna move the,
3 : i'm gonna move here.
2 : so you can give it to her.
3 : so i can give you
3 : this.
1 : thanks
3 : and
3 : oh actually, i'll just use my sandbag
2 : yea
2 : yeah, you should keep one of the two.
1 : mmhmm
3 : to shore this up.
3 : one of those.
3 : and two treasure cards.
3 : another helicopter
1 : oh good.
3 : and i need three flood cards.
3 : thank you
3 : alright, howling garden is gone
1 : hmm
2 : ok
3 : uh copper gate
3 : and lost lagoon is gone now.
3 : that was a really bad one, 
2 : yeah
1 : uh huh
3 : 
3 : and
3 : that's it
3 : your turn
2 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : umm, well, let's go here
1 : and there's nothing to shore up right? so
2 : oh you should've gone down towards her.
1 : oh
1 : can i retract that?
2 : i don't know
1 : ok, umm
1 : good call
1 : uh,
1 : yeah, then uh
1 : just take up
1 : two treasure cards
1 : oh
1 : well
1 : i should've just stayed where i was
2 : yeah
1 : maybe i'll just wait
1 : umm so
3 : i can helicopter lift here on my turn.
1 : ok, that works for me.
2 : so you guys get rid of those, yeah
3 : if need be
1 : these things
3 : saves us a turn.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : sorry
1 : and these three hopefully it's not
1 : one of those
1 : dunes of deception,
1 : silver gate,
1 : which is right here,
1 : and cave
1 : of embers.
2 : oh god
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : ok, i'm gonna
2 : get off that.
2 : i'm going to give you this one,
2 : just in case
3 : thank you.
2 : i get close to that
2 : umm
2 : and i might 
2 : i'll
2 : shore this one up.
2 : since i'm adjacent
2 : ok
2 : one of each.
2 : ok
2 : tidal palace,
1 : mm
2 : bronze gate,
2 : coral palace
2 : ok
1 : oh ok
3 : so i'm gonna shore this up
3 : umm
3 : and then
3 : what should i do next?
3 : you need
2 : i mean, since you shored it up, she can just move over and do it on her turn, so we don't need to
3 : yeah
3 : yeah, we can just do that, we can save these.
2 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : i can fly to anywhere really. do we still have flame cards?
2 : mmhmm
3 : do we have flame cards?
1 : what cards?
2 : we already
3 : well we can keep this option open. so should i fly here?
3 : or like move here
1 : yeah
3 : and use my last action to shore this up.
3 : i think
1 : that's a good idea, yeah
3 : so
2 : we don't need to shore that one up.
2 : oh, cause we get guess we need to
3 : yeah, cause we can have the embers
3 : just in case we get the
2 : but we already
3 : oh, we already got that one.
1 : oh we co, yeah we 
2 : but i mean
2 : we would still need to get there oh wait no, if we're gonna get this one then ok.
3 : well
3 : that's out of the question.
1 : yeah
2 : they don't necessarily matter.
3 : maybe it'll just be best, cause, just to keep tiles i can fly there and shore it up anyway
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : 
3 : so two treasure cards
3 : i have to discard one one, two, three, four, five
3 : nope, that's six.
2 : yeah i think you should do it, do those two.
1 : oh
2 : the one's the two that you got.
3 : this one
3 : well this is five
2 : oh yeah
3 : so, it's fine
2 : ok
1 : cool
3 : and then umm
3 : three.
1 : oh
3 : oh the forbidden 
1 : ok
2 : da da da
1 : oh no
3 : alright, oh no
3 : temple of the sun
3 : alright, no harm done there. misty marsh
3 : and watchtower.
1 : mm
2 : ok
1 : ok cool
1 : ok, well i'm just gonna
1 : go here,
1 : take this
1 : and i could probably oh
1 : i can't shore this up.
1 : can i move again?
3 : you can move again. that's you have three actions.
2 : yeah
1 : k, so i moved once,
1 : that's my second move,
2 : yeah, i think you're done.
2 : or yeah, cause you can go treasure.
1 : yeah
2 : capture one
1 : maybe i'll just chill at
1 : fool's landing instead.
1 : just
1 : just in case, i don't know why.
1 : umm can i have
1 : two treasure?
2 :  gotta get rid of those.
1 : oh yeah
1 : thanks
3 : yeah
1 : and thank you
1 : water's rise
2 : oh no
1 : i know
1 : that
2 : so we only need one more
3 : we're not at a risk of losing any important tiles.
1 : nah, we wanna keep
2 : yeah, we only need
3 : i have two of these, like wind thingies.
2 : i can give you this one and let's see what you draw next.
3 : yeah
2 : and you can fly yourself
1 : yeah
2 : to where i am.
3 : whispering garden, yeah
2 : yeah
2 : unless it gets pulled
1 : let's hope not
1 : dunes of deception
1 : aw it's out
1 : k
1 : umm, cave of embers,
1 : ok
1 : misty marsh,
1 : which is
2 : oh ok, my turn?
1 : yeah, mmhmm
2 : ok, so i'm gonna give you this one
2 : umm, where am i? over here. so
2 : i'm just gonna keep this one alive
1 : k
2 : and, my other one i'm just gonna give you this just in case we can't get that one.
1 : ok, good idea
3 : good idea
3 : 
2 : ok, ok, ok
1 : nice, yay we're close
2 : umm, oh i need
2 : these three.
2 : oh there's two there
2 : no!
1 : what?
2 : ok, whispering gardens
1 : it's ok
3 : so watchtower?
2 : yeah
2 : coral palace
2 : we gotta keep that one otherwise we can't get back to fool's
1 : oh yeah
1 : ok
2 : ok,
2 : your turn.
1 : hmm
3 : so
1 : maybe you should
3 : where's the
3 : i'm gonna shore this up,
1 : yup
3 : fly over there and shore that up
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : oh yup
3 : can you flip that?
1 : mmhmm
3 : thank you.
2 : ok good
1 : ok
2 : oh don't you need to
3 : oh yeah, two treasure cards
3 : oh this is a tough one
3 : should i
3 : keep a helicopter lift and give
3 : or get rid of a helicopter lift?
2 : i think
3 : and keep the sandbag?
2 : yeah, i mean she can always get us out as long as we
3 : so i can transfer that
2 : i mean i don't know if yeah
3 : yeah, i think that's a good idea
1 : alright
3 : cause you can just swing  that next time
2 : yeah
1 : sounds good
3 : you just have to keep that watch on garden
2 : and you can fly us over and she can take us out, ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : mm, k
2 : no, no, no you should probably stay there.
3 : yeah, stay there
1 : stay there? oh, even though
1 : you wanna
3 : cause you have to keep fool's
1 : oh we can capture that one too.
2 : oh, oh, oh you oh wait, he f
1 : we could just
2 : you have to draw those, those three flood cards.
3 : oh i didn't do that, yeah good call.
1 : oh yeah
3 : bronze gate,
3 : uh silver gate,
3 : and tidal palace.
1 : hmm
2 : oh, ok
1 : ok
2 : now it's your turn
3 : so, wait we should keep
2 : yeah i think you should stay there
3 : but we need coral palace to stay
2 : but she could still do it, she's,
2 : she is adjacent to it.
3 : ok, y yeah, you're right
2 : you can still
1 : ok
1 : oh yeah that was just to shore it up right?
2 : like shore it up.
1 : let's do that
1 : oh
1 : oh, i can't really move anywhere else now.
1 : i could just
1 : it's fine
3 : whatever you can just stay
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : that's fine
2 : so umm all you need to do
1 : oh i need to do the treasure thing.
