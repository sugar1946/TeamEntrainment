1 : umm shore these up
2 : action 1	
2 : action 2
1 : then
1 : guess i can just move right?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah,
3 : do you have any so you got
3 : two of the fire ones.
1 : i got two of the fire
3 : ok, so maybe move
1 : so no one has that
3 : towards one of the fire things.
1 : there
1 : so i guess, maybe here
3 : yeah
1 : oh jeez
1 : i'll, i'll
3 : they're both kinda far away for now, yeah
1 : i'll just chill there.
1 : yeah, alright
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : should i like
1 :  two of those
3 : wait does it so your thing, you can shore up two at once?
1 : nnhmm
3 : that means you only used one turn right?
1 : i used one and then two.
1 : and i guess i could do this one, three.
3 : ok then, cool
1 : uh
2 : good
2 : cool
1 : alright
1 : water's rise, great
1 : uh, this one
2 : so
1 : eh
2 : and then
1 : all of these
1 : this guy, yeah, thanks
2 : up, down, doesn't matter, right?
1 : yeah, it doesn't
2 : ok
1 : alright
2 : my turn
1 : yep
2 : umm
2 : it doesn't matter who has
2 : well
2 : oh
1 : oh we have to do that still, whoops
3 : are flood cards equal to the water level, oh yeah
1 : alright, gold gate, breaker's bridge, oh thank god.
1 : uh
3 : which one?
2 : gold
1 : uh, that's gone.
3 : gold gate, oh, ok
1 : that was fast.
2 : rest in peace, gold gate.
1 : that one
3 : gold gate,
3 : goodbye
2 : ok
2 : your turn's over right?
1 : yeah
2 : yes
2 : ok
2 : umm
3 : uh
2 : so
3 : i guess we should
3 : figure out which uh,
3 : which ones we're going for.
2 : so, what i can do is, i can give mine to her but then she already has
1 : has that one
2 : four cards.
3 : yeah, she would have to discard if she got to five.
2 : yeah
3 : ga does your thing let you take stuff from her too?
1 : w
1 : wait
2 : no
1 : i don't think this one counts as one, right?
2 : no, i mean you have three
3 : yeah, yeah, yeah
1 : oh, ok
1 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : uh
2 : that's not particularly necessary
2 : i think
2 : what i'd like to do
1 : i mean, i think i just give it to you next turn
2 : ok, we can, we can do that.
1 : i mean
2 : what i like to do is make sure that, i mean
2 : a goal we should have is to make sure we have, we keep tiles on the island, up
3 : mmhmm
2 : umm, so i'm gonna move and then flip these two, and it'll be
2 : three actions.
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : ok, yeah.
3 : mm
2 : one,
2 : two,
2 : three.
2 : take two of these
2 : uh, so i have
2 : that.
1 : two
2 : what's next?
2 : two of these?
1 : yeah
1 : wait, yeah, two.
1 : oh my god
2 : ok
2 : uh
2 : whispering garden,
2 : phantom rock.
3 : oh
3 : phantom rock's gone.
2 : k
3 : and then, pass me the phantom rock card.
3 : ok
2 : ok,
2 : is that it?
3 : cool, yeah
1 : yeah
1 : alright
3 : alright, so
1 : umm
1 : pilot
3 : whispering garden, ok, so
3 : what color am i, blue?
1 : yeah
3 : so, let's see, should i go to whispering garden and shore it up then?
2 : yeah
1 : i mean
2 : umm
2 : or i can fly someone somewhere, right?
3 : i can well i can use the lift to move someone somewhere, but
1 : he can fly somewhere.
1 : i would keep it for now.
3 : yeah maybe we'll hold onto it for now. i can fly myself anywhere for one action.
2 : uh oh
2 : i see
2 : umm
2 : yeah, i think that's fair.
3 : then i'm thinking, yeah, go here, shore up, and then
1 : yeah, you can
2 : you gotta
3 : and then, i have one more
3 : mm
2 : do you have one more, or two more?
1 : 
2 : is that one?
3 : i have one more, right? cause going there was one action and then shoring up was one action.
2 : got you
1 : oh yeah
3 : and then, let's see,
3 : anyone close to doing anything hmm?
2 : you don't have to take three actions.
3 : yeah, that's true.
1 : yeah
3 : ok, uh
1 : ok,
1 : guess we're good.
3 : unless there's anything you can think of that i should do, but
3 : mm
3 : ok
1 : mm
1 : everything's pretty good, alright
2 : ok
3 : and then i'll get two of these
3 : sweet, another lift.
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : and then
1 : oh alright
2 : two of these, right?
1 : yeah
3 : oh yeah,
3 : two of these.
3 : so, cliffs of abandon and lost lagoon
3 : ok
2 : ok
1 : alright,
1 : well,
1 : i guess first i'll do this one.
1 : wait, let me think this through.
2 : yeah
1 : do i wanna do that?
3 : lost lagoon, do we need lost lagoon for anything?
1 : hmm
1 : it's just there
2 : no
2 : not really
3 : yeah, it's kinda on the edge too, so,
3 : it's not as important.
2 : mmhmm
3 : one thing, like, if you can make it over to me so i can give you this,
3 : so then you'd have three
3 : of the fire ones
3 : at some point.
1 : ok, so i can do
2 : you could do that, so you could do one,
2 : two,
2 : shore,
3 : and then shore up and then on my tu
2 : so then make it
2 : i mean, and then
3 : wait on
1 : oh yeah, and then i could go over there.
3 : yeah, on my turn i can give stuff right?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah, ok
1 : yeah
1 : alright, one,
1 : two, and shore that up.
1 : that makes sense.
1 : alright
2 : two for you
1 : oh look at that
2 : oh
2 : oh man
3 : nice
1 : that one
1 : no we can't switch, never mind.
2 : and two of these for you
3 : one, two, three, four, five
1 : yes
1 : iron gate,
1 : and temple of the moon
3 : iron gate
2 : iron gate
1 : temple of the moon
2 : this temple of the sun
3 : no, temple of the moon, this guy
1 : oh, whoops
1 : there we go
2 : that's silly
2 : i don't know why they did that, ok
2 : good
1 : good
2 : good
3 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : three actions
2 : i don't wanna give
2 : mine to any of you
2 : but you
2 : uh
2 : but on your next turns you can give it to me if you want
1 : yeah
2 : umm
3 : mmhmm
2 : maybe i'll try to make my way toward one of these.
2 : there's two of them?
3 : yeah, the
3 : one at the top and the one at the bottom.
2 : oh, so it doesn't really matter.
3 : and that one's flooded.
2 : ok, so i'm gonna go the other way.
2 : umm, so that's one,
2 : two,
2 : this is a bad idea guys, three.
1 : mm
3 : i don't know. well i do have helicopter lift, but
2 : that's ok,
2 : you can keep it
3 : yeah
3 : ok.
2 : for now.
1 : that's
2 : ok
1 : as long as it's not flooded, it's fine.
2 : ok so we have a water's rise,
1 : alright,
1 : there's this.
2 : 
2 : move it up
2 : umm
2 : shuffle
1 : shuffle that.
2 : put it back on top
2 : mm, discard?
1 : yeah
2 : is that right?
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : ok, and then i have to take two of these?
1 : three.
3 : three now
2 : shit
2 : sorry that's some,
2 : sorry.
2 : umm
1 : oh on
2 : ok so temple of the moon is gone.
3 : ok
2 : lost lagoon,
2 : lost lagoon is gone.
1 : that's gone.
2 : so do you have a 
1 : then cliffs
2 : cliffs of abandon.
1 : alright
3 : cliffs of abandon
2 : ok
2 : and that is my turn.
3 : alright
3 : cool
2 : k
3 : so, on my turn, first i'll give this to you.
2 : two, three, four, five
1 : alright
3 : that's one
1 : oh wait
2 : that
2 : she has five cards then.
3 : yeah, that just means you have to discard one right?
2 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : get rid of
1 : this?
1 : this one
2 : get rid of the blue one
1 : oh
1 : yeah cause then we'll have three right?
2 : cause then we can give
3 : ok, yeah, that makes sense.
2 : try and get ours.
1 : ok
1 : four
3 : umm, yeah, ok
3 : and then i have
3 : two more things i can do. what should i do? should i shore up cliffs of abandon?
1 : yeah
2 : yes please.
3 : ok
1 : that's the only way i'm getting over there
3 : ok
3 : so that's two actions,
3 : and then
3 : what else can i do?
3 : umm
3 : should probably stay put right?
3 : so on when it's your turn you can give me that gold one.
1 : give you that and then i could do one two,
3 : so yeah, we'll be on
2 : yeah
1 : make my way over
3 : to the, yeah, cave of embers.
2 : ok,
2 : i'm ok with that.
3 : so, ok, do you need to go anywhere? i can lift you.
3 : i got so many helicopters.
2 : uh
1 : i mean if you wanna lift me to the fire one.
3 : yeah, the problem is you have to give me your thing too,
3 : you know?
3 : so we have to be on the same square
1 : oh
3 : or i could lift us both yeah, yeah, ok, why don't i do that?
2 : you could,
2 : you could,
2 : yeah, and then
1 : ok, we can both go
3 : i'll lift us both to the cave of embers
1 : ok
2 : ok
3 : ok and that's three for my turn.
1 : perfect
2 : and then
3 : oh wait, this doesn't count as an action.
2 : so
1 : so then
2 : did you pick your cards?
3 : no, i mean i have one more, right?
1 : if you want to
2 : one more action?
