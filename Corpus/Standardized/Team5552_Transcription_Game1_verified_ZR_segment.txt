3 : mm
3 : then what should i do?
2 : you can shore up but
2 : you're not next to anything, so.
3 : can i
3 : fly somewhere else again?

2 : faster than i thought it would.
3 : you have a sandbag though.
2 : i do have a sandbag, i think i'm going to use it
3 : mm
2 : on
3 : whispering?
2 : umm yeah, i'm gonna use it on whispering garden?
4 : we need that
3 : mmhmm
1 : and can you also give

2 : turn is to move though, so i just i'm just
1 : yes
2 : i'm gonna move
2 : here, actually, so we can be oh that's not me, sorry
4 : well that's me
4 : but you can move with me
2 : what am i doing?

1 : 
4 : i don't
3 : wait do you have
4 : er
4 : you, you
2 : na it doesn't matter cause i can give you my card anyway

2 : this card
4 : ok
2 : umm
2 : and i can
4 : , three
2 : shore
3 : well you don't have to i can
3 : on the next turn
3 : oh yeah actually 
3 : yeah, i might be able to shore up but you might be able to
3 : the
3 : whispering garden card might come up, so i don't yeah i think just using it is better.
2 : yeah, so i think i would i think i'm gonna use so i'm gonna use this and we can shore up
2 : well actually i'm on the i'm on the
2 : no you're on that
2 : so i wanna shore this up
2 : k
1 : ok, ooo good
2 : and so
2 : did we do that right?
3 : mm
2 : i moved one, i gave you a card, shh used
4 : i think
4 : you shored up that's three actions
3 : sandbag
2 : 
2 : well that's two i think cause this one
3 : it doesn't count as an action
2 : doesn't count as an action so i can
4 : oh, oh
2 : give a card to another player
3 : or
2 : you have one
3 : she has the red one
2 : ok, sure
1 : ok, now i have five, i can't get anymore
2 : you can't have anymore, ok
3 : ok
1 : now
2 : that's ok cause your turn just happened anyway
4 : no
2 : hopefully
4 : we were you allowed to give two
4 : two, is that that was two different treasure cards though
4 : is that allowed?
2 : umm, well this one is not an action does not count as an action.
3 : yeah
4 : right, but you gave me a treasure card oh you're the messenger.
1 : she can because that's is that your special power isn't it?
2 : uh, yeah, yeah, so i can give treasure cards to anyone
3 : ok
4 : ok
1 : ok, so then you pick up
2 : wait, wait, wait i think we have to be on the same
4 : or is that oh oh see
1 : right, we have to have a five
4 : huh
3 : two, four, five, three, four, five, she has six.
2 : one, two
4 : i have six
1 : ok, so if that's the case, if you have six or more you must immediately choose and discard
2 : uh
3 : no!
2 : you have to get rid of one
1 : choose and discard extra card to the treasure discard pile
3 : ah
2 : ok so pick one
1 : crap
4 : i better do this one
2 : yeah, do that one
4 : oh dear
2 : so we can just try and focus on the three, the flames and the
3 : oh yeah, uh, yeah it's the same.
2 : right, let's just try and do that. uh i don't know
3 : discard treasure deck
4 : yeah, yeah, i mean
1 : ok, that's too bad because now these are no good
4 : we have all of this, whatev
3 : yeah, it's the same two
4 : this one
4 : they're just not all on one person, we have them all
3 : yeah

2 : but i already used my action so my next turn i'm giving you this and then we can have one
4 : ok
2 : and i take
3 : mm
1 : if we don't die first.
4 : well
4 : do we all wait a minute, do we all does one person have to have all
2 : if we don't
4 : or do we have
3 : mm i think
4 : we have all
4 : four amongst us
1 : one person has to have four
2 : has to be 
4 : ok
2 : and then they have to be on that, so
2 : you're already on
2 : this so we can pick that up, so just give
4 : uh huh
3 : i can fly you guys there, whoever gets it
4 : ok
2 : ok
2 : also i have to pick up three flood cards, so let's see
4 : oy

3 : do i have to move first?
3 : i can shore up first right?
2 : umm
2 : it's just says three actions, yeah

2 : this.
4 : then can i just can i just
3 : yeah
1 : yay, we got the lion!
2 : yeah, just
4 : wait
2 : discard that
2 : card.
4 : discarding that
2 : ok, so now that
1 : yes!
2 : wait, so we have to wait for your turn to capture the tre
3 : ooo
4 : oh ah!
4 : oh ah, this is too much responsibility

2 : hopefully we don't get another shore up, that's all oh i can use my sandbag, i can use my sandbag.
1 : mm
2 : we're ok. ok, so
2 : ok so i gave you my card, that's one,
4 : ok
2 : i can move one space,
2 : umm, where should i move?
2 : where do we wanna be?
3 : you can't give your card to her, right?
3 : can you?
2 : i can give my card to anyone
3 : so
2 : oh
2 : but she has five
1 : i already have
3 : ah
1 : i have five
4 : you have five
1 : yup
2 : you have four, i can give it to you
4 : there's only
4 : the pilot has
3 : yeah, do you wanna give it to me?
2 : but, now that it doesn't make any sense
3 : it'll be the same, yeah
2 : we should just give them all to you
2 : i can give
2 : ok, so i can't give you any cards yet
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : i have to move a space, pretty much, that's all i can do.
2 : any, any particular place?
4 : i know
4 : yeah
4 : which one are you? this one?
2 : i'm the gray one, yeah.
4 : i don't think it matters
4 : at this point.
2 : i think i'm gonna go here, because if
1 : at this point
2 : if it ends up
2 : sinking, i can just swim to the next
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : it's not a big deal ok.
2 : alright, and two treasure cards
2 : ah
4 : oh
2 : ok
3 : ok
1 : hmm, ok
2 : ok
3 : i
3 : mm
2 : ok, and wait, i have three of these so let's just
4 : oh
2 : hold on. ok, so silver gate,
2 : crimson forest,
2 : oh
1 : that's sunk
3 : flood. do you wanna
4 : is sunk
2 : ok, well that's fine, you can swim to that one wait
2 : swim to
2 : adjacent one, i guess.
2 : right?
4 : yeah
2 : it was diagonal so it doesn't matter
1 : mmhmm
4 : it was adjacent
3 : 
2 : i don't know if it matters
4 : i don't know
4 : you had to swim somewhere.
2 : umm, it says up, down
2 : oh no
2 : it just says if a pawn is on a tile that's removed you must immediately swim to an adjacent tile.
2 : so not this one, right? it was here or was it here?
4 : it was here, so
4 : no it was here
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok, so i can only swim here
1 : so it
2 : it's the only place i can go
4 : huh
4 : what happens if there's no adjacent tile? do you just
1 : then you then we, then we're done.
2 : then you die, then we're done the game, the game's over.
4 : you just drown
3 : yeah
1 : then we're done.
4 : oh, that's right.
2 : ok, dunes of deception is gone.
3 : no, no, no i just flipped that one for you.
2 : oh, ok, whoof
3 : i already flipped it.
2 : ok
3 : ok, so it's my turn, so
2 : yeah
4 : oh my gosh, i'm a nervous wreck
3 : umm
3 : ok, so which one should i do, so because i am on the same one with you i can give you this card.
1 : for sure
2 : yes, you can
3 : should i do you guys want me to do that first? give it to you
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, you should give me that card.
3 : and i can i should probably
2 : pilot us
2 : off it yeah, pilot us to
3 : umm
2 : the cave
2 : cave of embers, or another
3 : no, no, no, well she needs
4 : why not
2 : oh, she needs to be there. you can pilot
3 : yeah, but i think i need to
4 : you're
4 : you could pilot us to flood landing
4 : or fool's landing and we can
3 : fool's landing?
4 : be there
4 : as we pass around these cards. we're getting
3 : but is
2 : you can also pilot just us
3 : ok
2 : so you can take us to
3 : but we have to be yeah, ok
2 : so, what i'm thinking is you can take us to cave of embers or
3 : which ones? one, two, three
2 : 
3 : but the thing is we can't go diagonally, only she can. we
2 : oh, but you can fly us. don't you have a card?
3 : yeah, but after we fly here, we can't move
3 : we can't move this way, none of us can move.
2 : oh, yeah you're right. ok, so then, move us here,
2 : and then when it's her turn she can give me the card and we'll have four.
4 : don't move me, don't pilot me
3 : i'll move, i'll move yeah, yeah, yeah, no you
2 : no, not you
2 : ok, does that make sense?
3 : what about moving here?
3 : cause if we move here we have to either move like this but we could at least go like that.
3 : we have a lot more options.
4 : i, i think
4 : that's an ok idea
4 : to put
4 : to go there.
2 : ok
2 : well
1 : why don't we wanna move you?
2 : well
2 : well, she has to be on
4 : because i have to be on there
1 : oh because you have to stay that's right, you have to i got it, that's right, that's right.
3 : yeah
4 : to capture it
4 : and that's my next turn.
1 : ok
2 : should i shore that up
2 : because if someone pulls up the water
3 : yeah i think
2 : water card, that might go
4 : oh
4 : if you can still yeah, yeah, if you have that
3 : yeah
1 : oh yeah
3 : yeah
4 : do it
3 : do that one
2 : ok, i'm gonna just do it
2 : i don't wanna take any chances right now, expecially 
3 : ok and where should i move us to?
1 : ok
2 : i think you should move us well, ok this is what i'm thinking
2 : i think
2 : i would
2 : rather us move here because then when it's her turn
2 : you can give me
2 : the
2 : fire
4 : excellent
2 : and then i'll have four and i'll be on this card
1 : ok
3 : oh yeah yeah
1 : ok
4 : then you'll already be there
3 : ok
1 : alright
2 : so then i don't have to waste another turn being on it, that's what i was thinking, but
1 : yeah, either
3 : yeah, yeah, yeah
4 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : if you think fool's landing is
3 : no no 
4 : nah, you're right, we're right next to it so
1 : yeah, no, no, you're right, you're right
2 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : so
1 : you're right messenger, you're right
3 : what are
3 : what color are you?
4 : i'm this i'm the green
2 : so gray and blue pilot us to
3 : 
2 : the cave of shadows
1 : yeah, ok
1 : alright
3 : and then
1 : oh gosh
4 : i know
3 : ok
2 : oh we don't need those cards anymore ok
3 : doesn't matter
3 : and
3 : i need that.
2 : you need three
1 : 
2 : oh god
3 : ok
3 : so this one is flooded, the bronze
2 : ah
3 : this one
2 : no
1 : ok
3 : in here
4 : what is flooded?
3 : none of them are sunken
2 : well
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : oh no
4 : alright, i'm capturing
2 : nobody has a sandbag do they?
1 : alright you're
2 : k i just
4 : oh wait
2 : yeah, so you can
4 : do i have to i'm capturing
1 : yeah, it's your turn.
3 : ok, you can do that
4 : i'm capturing
4 : the wind lion
2 : cool
1 : ok, now you
4 : ok, now i can move or shore up
4 : but i can, i can
2 : can, can you do both? you should move
3 : can you
2 : and shore up
3 : this one has that
1 : you
4 : that's not adjacent though
2 : no, yeah, she can't
4 : i have if i wanna move i can move to i can shore this, i can move that up and
2 : and move there
4 : move that and shore it up.
2 : yeah, ok well
2 : i mm
4 : oh ooo
4 : no, i can move to there and shore that one up
2 : yeah, i was thinking that well umm, yeah, yeah, yes, yes
2 : because we need this one all
1 : wait, wait, that's me, you're moving me.
4 : no i'm not moving you, i'm just lifting you up.
2 : no, she's just
1 : wait wait
1 : oh you shored me up? ok
4 : we're just shoring you up
2 : that's, that's, yeah that's good.
1 : thank you my feet were getting wet.
4 : i wouldn't want i don't want you to
2 : alright so now it is no you need to pull two cards
3 : are you done?
4 : oh
4 : ok
4 : alright, we'll just umm
2 : ok
3 : 
2 : and you need three
1 : ok
4 : and
2 : i'm pretty nervous because this cave of shadows is gonna be in here so
4 : ok
4 : watch
2 : if we pull a water's up card
4 : where's the watchtower? it's
1 : over there, ok, flood
4 : flood it's flooded
4 : misty marsh is flooded and howling garden
3 : ok
1 : ok
4 : w oh
4 : huh ah!
3 : yay we made it
1 : we skipped through that one, ok, here we go.
2 : ok
2 : i'm pretty nervous.
1 : umm
1 : let me shore i'm gonna start by shoring some stuff up
2 : you can't can you shore something diagonal to you? no, cause you're not
4 : but
4 : wait, who, who's
3 : wait
1 : no, it has to be
3 : she can shore
3 : oh where are you?
4 : are you the blu are you blue? oh no, you're red
2 : she's not on there, she's on here
1 : it has to be
2 : oh
1 : i'm red, so i can shore up these two
4 : uh
2 : yeah
4 : but you know what
3 : but we need the
4 : you want
1 : and i can't do that one though, because it's diagonal to me
4 : you can't move diagonally.
3 : oh yeah
2 : damn
4 : oh
1 : right?
4 : yeah, because if you
4 : could get there you could give the messenger
1 : on adjacent tiles yeah, ok
1 : alright so
1 : now i can move
3 : it's ok, if, if the if it does come up she can use her helicopter and just move you here
2 : yeah but we
2 : yeah
3 : if, if one of these die, cause we have both anyways. one's gonna
2 : i don't
2 : that's true, ok, we'll, we'll figure it out. we'll get to it when it comes
3 : yeah
1 : i gotta get rid of a card anyway, i mean it would be probably a good
4 : well
2 : you could
1 : thing
2 : you could either give it to me or to her
2 : actually, you should give it to
3 : , she's not on the same one as us
2 : the pilot
2 : oh, true, never mind, you can't give any
3 : she can't
1 : but i, but i didn't move yet, so i could be on
3 : mm
1 : which one of us is green?
4 : i'm green
3 : who's green?
2 : explorer
1 : you're green
3 : oh you can't move here.
2 : move oh you can't move. so you have to move to explorer
1 : mm
2 : if you were to move
2 : and then you could give her your card.
1 : yup, i'm gonna do that.
1 : so i, i shored, i moved, give a card

1 : nope
2 : uh just in case
1 : you can do it

4 : we won't blame you, we won't hold it against you

2 : so
2 : so
2 : i can move, but i don't wanna move right now.
2 : i can give my card to someone
2 : i would
3 : wait, wasn't the point of you staying there so that she could give you a card?
3 : and you can get it?
1 : but i wasn't on the same tile, with her
2 : yeah, she wasn't on the same card
3 : yeah
2 : neither were
3 : well
2 : neither was the ex
3 : mm, you can use a hel never mind, i don't know.
4 : i
2 : yeah, someone should

3 : oh, never mind, it doesn't matter.
1 : this card to treasure island, so i can move
2 : can't you just move
1 : you
2 : just move yourself to here
3 : the thing is she can't give you a card anyways, even if she moves there.
4 : i need to give her a card
2 : yeah, i thought the point was that
1 : ok wait
2 : the explorer was supposed to
4 : cause i have this
2 : well yeah
1 : right, but you ca
4 : so if you would, if you even if you moved me here, i could move diagonally there and then give her this card
1 : but if i move you
1 : but can't i i can move you
1 : move one or more pawns on the same tile to any
1 : to any other tile,
1 : so i could move us here
1 : oops, hello
4 : yeah
2 : yeah, ok do that
1 : ok
1 : and then this is done.
2 : yes
3 : mmhmm
