1 : ok
1 : so i'm gonna start with shoring up those two, sound good?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : ok that's one action.
2 : yup
1 : so i have two more.
1 : umm i could move here and shore those up. right?
3 : right.
3 : yeah.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and that would be three.
1 : and then i have to get two treasure cards.
1 :  
1 : oh so water rise.
1 : ok let's see move one tick mark.
1 : shuffle the
1 : discard pile. oh i guess we have one.
1 : place on top.
3 : and then the water rise card comes over here.
1 : yeah.
1 : ok cool.
1 : now it's your turn right?
2 : and then do you have to draw flood cards at the end?
1 : oh right
1 : so now i draw two.
3 : yep
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and i have gold gate and phantom rock.
3 : phantom rock, that's sunk now.
1 : ok so then take the flood card.
2 : oh
2 : oh shoot
2 : sorry and then this goes as well
1 : that sunk too?
3 : alright
1 : ok so did that eliminate anything for us?
1 : or we still have options
3 : ah
1 : or i guess less for
1 : did any of those have the icons? ok.
3 : we still have options.
2 : ok my turn
1 : your turn.
2 : ok so i
2 : i think i'll move this way
1 : ok
2 : since that's farther away from the edge and then.
2 : oh
2 : i don't know if i really need to move much further. i guess i can move to a spot where
2 : one of these guys
2 : is ?
3 : hmm
1 : yeah
2 : so this might make more sense.
2 : since this lion's here and i have
2 : the lion
1 : ok.
3 : yeah we'll have to wait till we get more of our treasure cards to see which one's like the be easiet one to get right away.
1 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
2 : and then
1 : you get two treasure cards now right?
2 : yeah i'll just
1 : if you're done your actions.
2 : i think that makes the most sense, yeah
1 : ok
2 : umm sandbags that's useful, and another one of these guys.
2 : and then i have to draw two flood cards.
1 : two flood cards.
2 : so
2 : breaker's bridge and temple of the moon
1 : ok.
1 : i'll flip this, and where's the what's the other one?
2 : breaker's bridge.
1 : oh right here.
2 : ok
3 : alright my turn?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : mmhmm.
3 : ok umm where do you guys think i should fly?
1 : oh right cause you can fly. well let's see you have two of these.
3 : yeah.
2 : do you?
1 : i have two of these, we have two of these so
3 : yeah really t
1 : anything but
1 : purple.
1 : that's or we have those equal
1 : amount
3 : alright
3 : i'll, i'll just move right here.
3 : we'll s ee how that goes.
1 : and
2 : ok
1 : ok.
3 : so now i have two more actions right?
1 : yeah.
1 : should you?
1 : and y
2 : can you?
2 : shore up diagonally? i don't think you can. it would just be moving diagonally.
1 : no
1 : no that
3 : could i
3 : maybe if i fly there and then shore that one up?
1 : yeah.
2 : that's an option.
1 : or do you want to wait, do you want to
3 : alright i'll fly it.
1 : well that one
1 : doesn't have should we shore up this instead?
2 : have
3 : yeah
1 : can you fly there cause that has an icon on it.
3 : yeah can i fly right on it and shore it up? is that a thing?
1 : umm
2 : i think
2 : so?
1 : you're, you're pilot
3 : i mean it doesn't really matter where i move cause i'm the pilot so i'll just
1 : once per turn for action. yeah cause you can shore up what you're on can't you?
3 : yeah, i'm just gonna go for it.
2 : i'm pretty sure you can.
1 : ok, yeah.
1 : only once per turn
1 : for one action. oh no you can't cause you already flew.
3 : gotcha.
1 : oh wait.
1 : we misread that, ok so don't do that.
3 : alright, i'll just draw two cards.
1 : ok
3 : got another one of these and helicopter.
1 : ok then you need
1 : two flood cards.
1 : here you go, what'd it say?
3 : lost lagoon and cliffs of abandon.
2 : cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
1 : i'll put them in discard pile for you.
1 : alright
2 : ok i think it's your turn
1 : ok now it's my turn. ok.
1 : well, should i shore stuff up?
2 : you're the
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : let's see well. i can do
1 : this can be a turn i guess and then this is my second or my second action right? cause i can do two for one
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : umm
1 : should i
1 : i treasure giving treasure cards is an action right?
3 : yeah but you have to be on the same tile i believe
1 : to give them?
3 : yeah unless you're the messenger.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : oh.
1 : ok so i can't. ok so then is there anything else i should do?
2 : yeah
2 : umm
1 : or should i move here and shore this up right? or no that would be two more actions.
2 : that would be two separate actions yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : so
1 : anything else?
3 : i think, i think we're fine right now.
1 : ok so now i need
1 : two treasure cards right?
3 : yeah
1 : is it it's always two right?
2 : mmhmm.
2 : yeah.
1 : but then when i have more then five, i have to discard, but now i'm at five.
3 : alright and we have four of these guys.
1 : yeah.
3 : so we'll work on transferring cards.
1 : and that
1 : ok and now i need two floods, right?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and we have whispering garden and iron gate.
1 : whispering garden
1 : ok
2 : alright
2 : so it's my turn i'm gonna move away from the flooded
1 : so that's one.
2 : thing
2 : umm
3 : i think you should shore that up too because it's got the, the wind on it.
2 : i think that mi yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 : yeah
1 : so that's two, now you have one more.
2 : and i can only shore up ones that are adjacent to me so there aren't any other ones that are flooded
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah so you could either move or you could just end your turn or
1 : or you could give a single card per action.
2 : oh that's true.
1 : would that be helpful? but then i have to get rid of something if you give it to me and if you
1 : can you you can't really give him anything.
3 : yeah i don't really have use for anything
1 : ok
3 : you could use the sandbags on
3 : one of the tiles but
3 : neither of them have a treasure associated with them.
1 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
2 : that doesn't seem like a
1 : ok
3 : so you're just gonna end it?
2 : yeah i think so. oh great.
1 : ok
2 : umm so i got one of these guys and then
2 : water's rise so this goes up. shuffle the card flood dis pile
1 : cool
1 : and then you pick
1 : three now right?
1 : as part of your turn. put that away.
2 : and then pick three yeah.
1 : yeah.
2 : so, cliffs of abandon
2 : whispering garden, breaker's bridge.
1 : whispering garden.
1 : ok
3 : alright i'm, i'm thinking that we needa
3 : somehow transfer these cards to one of us.
1 : yeah.
3 : and use it on one of these. i'm assuming this one cause it's closer.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : but
3 : we're separated so i should probably well you could, you could shore that up too also.
1 : yeah.
1 : i could shore it up.
3 : umm
1 : and then move or something.
1 : so what should you do?
3 : or i can fly.
3 : i can, i can fly you here and then because we're on the same tile i can give you
1 : oh yeah then.
1 : yeah.
3 : this card and you discard one of those.
1 : yeah that would be good cause then i can get the treasure on my turn which is next.
1 : right?
3 : ok yeah let's do that. so i'll fly you first. that doesn't count as a turn.
3 : to here.
1 : ok
3 : then i'll give you.
3 : this card and you
1 : yeah.
1 : so what should i get rid of? it doesn't
3 : yeah we have one of each so either.
1 : you both have
1 : oh but you have two purple so i'll get rid of this.
3 : oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : ok
1 : so put that in the discard right?
3 : yup.
1 : so that was one of your turn, or one action.
3 : yeah
1 : so now you have two more if you want to do anything.
3 : so i still have two.
3 : so i could
1 : but you should stay here so i can or no now i have it, it doesn't matter.
3 : yeah so i could fly somewhere and shore something up
3 : in my last two turns right?
1 : yeah
2 : did you already fly somewhere or did you stay in the same place? ok you've flown to there ok.
1 : no he flew me.
3 : no i haven't moved yet.
1 : so you might as well fly somewhere.
1 : and shore something up on your last
1 : two right?
3 : yeah i'm just trying to think where which one i should
3 : shore up.
3 : probably that one i'm thinking
1 : yeah, it's the most valuable.
3 : alright.
3 : i'll fly here
1 : ok so now you need two treasure.
1 : and then when you're ready three flood cards.
3 : alright, iron gate.
3 : lost lagoon.
1 : i think iron gate's out now right?
2 : iron gate
3 : yeah and temple of the moon.
1 : and temple of the moon. ok those two are out.
2 : iron gate
1 : and then you got the oh yeah i got that one, or i got the temple of the moon. no tha i already flipped it.
2 : oh ok.
1 : ok.
3 : alright.
1 : so now
3 : this
1 : can go into the discard and now it's my turn right? so i want to, how do i buy or
3 : yeah it goes over there.
3 : yup
2 : mmhmm
1 : how do i get the?
3 : that just, just costs one action.
2 : i think you just put it in the
1 : ok so that's one action so.
3 : to get
3 : to capture a treasure?
1 : do i
1 : do anything with these cards or?
1 : is that clear?
2 : you woud probably put em here.
3 : ah probably put em here.
1 : then i take this right?
1 : let's see.
1 : is that in there?
1 : treasure deck.
1 : four cards.
2 : if you discard four matching treasure cards to the discard treasure discard pile while your pawn is on the
1 : ok
1 : cool.
2 : it has to be on a corresponding tile.
1 : yeah it's on it so i'll take this
2 : ok cool.
1 : put those so that's one of my actions right?
2 : mmhmm.
3 : yeah
1 : so now
1 : i can move well, i might as well
1 : move up here and shore these so for my last part of my turn right?
3 : sure.
2 : mmhmm
1 : cause i can do two.
2 : yeah.
3 : yeah.
1 : and now my turn is over. i need two treasure cards right?
3 : yup.
1 : and then three flood cards.
1 : ok crimson forest, copper gate and
2 : crimson forest
1 : temple of the sun.
3 : alright
1 : where's temple of the sun? ok.
3 : down here.
2 : down here
1 : and now i put these here.
1 : you're turn.
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : let's see
3 : so we have four of these.
2 : yeah
3 : so we should probably work on that next.
2 : right. umm
1 : and you're close to one of them.
1 : so
1 : it has to be your turn to give your card to someone right?
1 : to give treasure cards. yeah.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : yeah yeah yeah they cost one action.
1 : yeah ok.
1 : so can you give more than one treasure card?
1 : or is it just one card per
1 : what does that say?
2 : umm it says i can give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action
1 : ok so
3 : yeah it says give one or more.
2 : so theoretically i could give more than one card.
1 : that's
1 : yeah so maybe you could give
2 : umm
2 : who else would be close to? i guess it would be
1 : well he, he can fly anywhere right? and he's going
3 : yeah.
2 : that's true.
3 : yeah and i'm right there anyways.
1 : yeah.
2 : ok so i'll, my one action will be giving those to you.
1 : ok
2 : and my second action.
1 : do you want to shore something up?
2 : we'll shore up this guy.
3 : we also have sandbags too because both of these
1 : oh yeah we need to do something with that. so maybe that should be your third one.
2 : oh that's very true.
3 : yeah we can't risk losing those. and i have sandbags too.
3 : oh and this doesn't count as an action.
2 : oh
2 : oh yeah and this doesn't either so.
1 : oh right. uh maybe you should do this one cause it's closer first.
2 : yeah so i'll
2 : shore up this guy
1 : put that away
2 : that doesn't count as anything
3 : do you still have two or one?
1 : ok so you still have
2 : i had one more.
1 : one more.
3 : ok
1 : is there anything else you want to do?
2 : umm
2 : i don't know if there's anything that really makes much more sense to do.
3 : yeah i think we're alright right now
1 : ok
1 : so now two treasure.
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : alright one of these guys and then.
1 : you may only have five cards in your hand.
1 : you have six.
3 : oh i have six. ok i'll discard.
1 : when did you get that.
3 : just this turn.
1 : oh just this time, ok.
2 : oh
1 : so
3 : i'm gonna discard
1 : it hasn't started.
3 : sandbags because i think we'll be alright right now. we don't have a lot of flood and we need this at the end anyways.
1 : ok, ok.
2 : mm.
2 : yeah
1 : ok so
1 : you got a water's rise, ok.
2 : yep so i did this already yet alright thank you.
1 : here i'll push it up for you. oh you already did?
1 : or not it's getting 
2 : i don't think so.
2 : then shuffle these guys again
1 : ok so
1 : put it on top.
2 : mmhmm. and then i need to draw three.
1 : three. yeah see
1 : you can work together to
2 : temple of the sun, temple of the moon.
1 : make it move faster.
3 : temple of the sun's gone.
2 : and breaker's bridge.
1 : ok.
2 : this guy
2 : so which one's gone? temple? ok
3 : temple of the sun.
1 : so we really need to protect this or we're out.
2 : yeah.
1 : ok so
3 : yeah.
1 : now it's your turn?
1 : pilot
3 : yeah i'm just
3 : worried about this one like if
3 : i don't
1 : well can you fly there and just shore it up?
3 : yeah but then
3 : oh yeah i guess i could i'm trying to think ah maybe i'll move here shore it up and then you can shore your that one up and move here transfer the
1 : yeah.
3 : the cards and then i'll fly there when once it's my turn around again?
1 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : yeah that would work.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : ok so here's one of my actions.
3 : this is two.
3 : umm
3 : and
3 : i think
3 : is there anything else that needs to be done right now?
1 : i don't think so. what do you think?
2 : i can't think of anything
1 : ok so
1 : my turn so i'll shh
2 : well did you have a
3 : oh i gotta
1 : oh wait yeah you gotta get that treasure.
3 : pull my two cards. and i gotta discard some.
1 : get rid of one.
1 : or two.
3 : yeah i have a lot of cards so i'll just discard one of these right away cause i already have one.
3 : and i guess
3 : just discard one of these.
1 : i guess.
1 : and then three flood cards.
3 : copper gate.
3 : crimson forest.
3 : so crimson forest is gone and whispering garden.
1 : whispering garden. i just saw that.
1 : oh right up here.
1 : ok.
2 : alright so we need that guy.
1 : so now it's my turn.
1 : well i should probably shore this up, i'm guessing.
1 : and then.
1 : what else can i do?
3 : umm y move there.
1 : oh i can move here.
2 : and give.
1 : and then i can give you.
2 : the lion.
3 : yeah and then that's all three of your turns.
1 : this and that's that all three of them that i need. ok.
3 : and i got to discard another card right?
1 : so just get rid of the purple.
1 : i would
3 : this one?
1 : cause you need the helicopter. no i would get rid of that.
2 : we need a helicopter lift to get off yeah.
3 : oh purple.
1 : and then so give me two treasure cards.
3 : oh cool 
1 : ok so we're pretty set on that and then i need three of these.
1 : ok silver gate.
1 : cliff something, cliffs of abandon and tidal palace.
1 : anything out or no we're good.
3 : no we already got this one anyways, so it doesn't even matter if that sinks.
1 : ok.
1 : oh true. ok so we don't  saving that. so that's the end of my turn. now it's yours.
2 : cool
2 : ok.
2 : umm
1 : umm oh you probably definitely want to shore that up.
3 : shore that up.
2 : yeah.
1 : so that's one.
2 : and then i can
2 : i guess it doesn't matter if it's either of those
1 : well it would probably be good cause we're both
1 : well it doesn't matter now cause shh does it matter? well cause we
2 : oh
1 : can still be on it after it sinks, we can just move off of it
3 : mmhmm
1 : so it doesn't really matter.
2 : yeah
2 : so should i move
2 : over
2 : well, doesn't matter.
1 : maybe you shh
1 : should you start?
1 : should you start moving there so
3 : try to
3 : so you can turn it in?
1 : or
1 : or should you
1 : yeah i don't know.
3 : maybe i would just shore up to keep mobility because these are all sort of like
1 : yeah true.
3 : around the same area.
3 : so you've only done one.
2 : so shore up
2 : this guy?
3 : yeah i would
2 : and that would be my second move.
1 : cause you didn't move right? so you could
1 : or did you move?
2 : yeah i
2 : shoring up was one of my actions and then two.
1 : so one two and then maybe
2 : can i just move here? and then i would be closer to this if we
2 : well actually it makes more sense for you to be closer.
1 : or should you shore up this or should you shore up this one too cause it's in the center?
3 : yeah as long as we're all together i can just fly there.
3 : yeah might as well.
1 : and we can't move diagonally so that would be kind of difficult.
3 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
1 : so that's your turn, so two treasure.
2 : ok
3 : and three flood cards?
1 : yeah.
2 : yeah, ok so then
1 : and you's
1 : have five so you're good.
2 : five and then three.
1 : three
2 : dunes of deception, cave of shadows, bronze gate.
1 : bronze gate, where's cave of shadows?
3 : right here.
2 : was this already flipped? ok
1 : oh
1 : no i just flipped it.
1 : so we're
1 : all good.
2 : ok
3 : ah my turn? alright so i'll
1 : yeah so you should
1 : you can fly right and then just trade?
3 : yeah
3 : so fly here.
3 : that's one action. turning them in is another action.
1 : mmhmm.
3 : and they go here right?
1 : yeah and then you get that piece.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : and i have one more action.
3 : umm
1 : so should you maybe just move off of that cause it doesn't really matter any more?
3 : yeah.
3 : yeah i can
1 : just to get mobility.
3 : just move back.
1 : so now you need two treasure.
1 : and i'll hand you these three.
3 : and we got four of the embers already so we got
3 : cave of embers, is now sunk.
1 : ok
3 : howling garden and misty marsh.
1 : misty marsh. ok.
1 : and now it's my turn right? we just put these in discard?
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok so i'm here
3 : yeah
1 : we do still need, we need one of these so i might as well shore this up.
3 : one of those yeah.
2 : yeah.
3 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
2 : and then i realized i can give you this on my next turn.
1 : and so that's one
1 : that's one turn. ok, or
1 : well no, no, i should just move here and give it to you.
1 : right?
1 : to finish off my turn?
3 : give what to her?
1 : if i'm, i could give her these cards and she would have all
2 : i don't know if you can give me more than one card though. can you?
1 : yeah can i give you thr, we can give multiple cards right? didn't you say that?
3 : yeah.
3 : yeah if you're on the same tile.
1 : yeah so that was my one turn.
2 : oh.
1 : should i move
2 : but i can't have more than five.
1 : but then you just discard.
2 : i guess that's
1 : right can't she?
1 : dis
1 : if i give her more she can't hold them so she has to discard some right? cause didn't i give
1 : didn't we give
3 : yeah the second you get them you just have to discard others.
1 : you just have to get rid of other ones.
2 : ok.
1 : because then if we do that, then you could just go to that one if it doesn't sink.
1 : or this one, right?
2 : yeah.
3 : how many turns have you used? just one?
1 : i've just used one.
1 : so i can move here, give her the cards.
2 : but i can't
1 : and then
2 : my
2 : my pawn isn't on a space where i can redeem it.
1 : but then on your turn, couldn't you move here and then redeem it?
2 : but i think i would have to immediately
3 : it would take her two turns.
2 : discard the cards that you give me.
1 : no you could discard other ones couldn't you? if i say i gave you
3 : those three then you could discard that, that, and that.
1 : if i give you these three you could get rid of these three.
2 : i can, ok.
1 : then on your next turn
1 : you could go down to here and get that and then we'd almost win right?
2 : ok
2 : i think so cause we would
1 : is that correct? ok so
3 : yeah just
2 : cause we just have to
2 : get three of these guys and then get to the landing.
1 : and then get back to here and you already have that card.
3 : it'll just take you two turns to move down there right? two actions?
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah and then the third to redeem.
2 : yeah.
1 : so i move here next for my second action.
3 : sure.
1 : so now i'm with her.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : and i can give you these as my final one.
1 : and then you get rid of three.
2 : yeah it's a single card.
1 : give a single card but didn't it say cards on here?
2 : a messenger can give more than
1 : or no
1 : oh i can't cause i'm not a messenger.
2 : yeah
1 : a messenger
3 : well it just says here you may give one or more of your treasure cards to another player if you're on the same island tile.
1 : so isn't this contradicatory then to that?
3 : well just follow that one?
3 : oh you can't do
3 : all four
1 : but doesn't wait where did you say it says give more than card?
3 : choose three actions of the four action types.
1 : where does it say cards plural on here though isn't that different?
1 : give a card. it says you give or one more treasure cards to another player if both pawns are on the same, so that doesn't
3 : it said one or more.
1 : make sense.
3 : alright well
2 : it cost one action for each card to give away, so that's why.
1 : oh, oh ok. that's the part we were missing.
3 : oh, gotcha, gotcha ok.
1 : ok so i can't
1 : do that, so i can well i already moved there so that was my action so i don't think i can take it back.
2 : how many, did you only move one?
1 : but then i shored that, so i have one action left, so.
2 : oh ok.
1 : i guess i could.
3 : you could
1 : what should i do?
3 : just to use an action
1 : might as well give her something right? should i give her a purple?
2 : like one card?
2 : yeah
1 : should i give her a purple one?
3 : ah

2 : oh that's true.
3 : oh yeah.
1 : should i just give that to her then cause we didn't realize that?
3 : yeah we just gotta hope that yeah

2 : yeah.
2 : ok
3 : just the lion probably.
1 : yeah.
2 : cause we already
2 : ok
1 : ok so now oh i need two treasure and then
1 : three flood, sorry i misunderstood that i guess. ok water rise and helicopter lift.
3 : yeah i just didn't read the next sentence.
1 : ok so gotta do this immediately.
1 : rise
3 : and we have
3 : more helicopter lifts now so we can fly multiple people whenever we get enough cards
1 : oh cool so that goes in the discard. we shuffle that.
2 : mmhmm
1 : and then put them on top and now it's still three though.
3 : and we still have just about fourteen minutes.
1 : oh i didn't know there was, i was wondering how much i was like how do we not know how much time we have.

2 : ok.
1 : now it's your turn.
2 : alright so.
1 : when i we can use these at any time right?
1 : not it doesn't count as an action. so i could fly her somewhere if she needed to or you could.
3 : yeah.
2 : mmhmm. yeah.
3 : yeah.
3 : yeah we're all on the same tile so we could all fly anywhere.
1 : yeah.
2 : so i
2 : should move one and then shore this guy and that'll be my second
1 : shore that up
1 : so that's two
3 : so that's two actions.
2 : and then
2 : should i give you, i should give you this so that you have
1 : but you're not on the same space as me now.
2 : but i'm the messenger so i can
3 : she's the messenger though.

1 : or should you fly me there?
3 : fly you there?
3 : cause we have two of them. we only need one to leave the game.
1 : yeah.
1 : so should you fly me here?
1 : considering it's not sunk and that one could sink?
3 : that's what i'm thinking.
1 : as one turn. oh wait, that doesn't even count, that doesn't even count as an action ok yeah.
3 : yeah.
3 : then no that doesn't count, so i might as well just do that now right?
1 : so fly me here yeah i'm red.
3 : you're red right?
3 : ok
1 : ok so that's the first thing. so now you have two more things.
3 : no that doesn't count it's still three.

1 : oh should you take steps to get closer?
3 : so
3 : i could just fly there.
1 : oh right so should you do that for your turn?
3 : i'm thinking.

1 : yeah
1 : yeah i don't think so cause even if this
1 : floods it's, i can still take it.
3 : yeah so once i fly here
2 : well
