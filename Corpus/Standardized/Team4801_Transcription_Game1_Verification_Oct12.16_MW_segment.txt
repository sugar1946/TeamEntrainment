2 : mmhmm
3 : mm
2 : alright
1 : ok so i have
1 : the fire ones and i'm here
1 : umm i guess
1 : i'm definitely gonna shore up
1 : these
1 : two for my first action
1 : umm any recommendations on what i should do next?
2 : umm
2 : you could move to this one and then shore up those two
1 : yeah  so that's, that'd be the end of it.
2 : but tha
3 : yeah
2 : that'd be your second and then leave
1 : two and
1 : three
3 : yeah so that's all three
1 : ok
1 : super
2 : and then you draw
2 : is it three or is it two?
1 : mm yeah draw two treasure
3 : two
1 : oh water's rise
1 : so it's still
1 : two
1 : and then shuffle the flood
1 : we don't have a flood discard pile do we? ok
2 : yeah we do
1 : and place it on top of the flood draw pile
1 : and then
1 : discard this card to the treasure
1 : thank you
2 : mmhmm
2 : and then you have to
3 : draw
3 : flood cards equal to the water level
2 : flood card
1 : so that's two and just these
2 : so just two
1 : see golden gate and lost la
1 : goon
1 : lost lagoon, uh oh lost golden gate
3 : where's golden gate?
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : and where do i put these? in here? ok super
2 : mm
2 : just back here yeah
2 : ok
3 : oh put the golden gate in here since
2 : mm
2 : oh
1 : 
2 : you're right
2 : ok
2 : none for me
2 : does it
2 : make sense for me to do any actions yet, i guess to
1 : mm
2 : save this one
2 : 
2 : right cause i can't do anything else right now.
3 : 
1 : one two
2 : one two
3 : you can go, can you go diagonal or not?
2 : no
1 : no that was the one we don't have
3 : oh ok
2 : and that would be three
3 : alright
1 : oh
1 : so you have two of the rock ones that's good
2 : ok and then i go here
3 : yeah
1 : the earthstone
2 : phantom rock and breaker's bridge
2 : we just lost phantom rock
1 : breaker's bridge, ah
3 : ok
2 : and breaker's bridge
2 : ok
3 : alright
3 : so you guys 
2 : nnhmm
1 : nnhmm
2 : alright
3 : can you use a helicopter lift
2 : so i guess the only thing really to do is to try to save this one.
3 : yeah
3 : so should i just
3 : use helicopter lift?
3 : to go over there
1 : or you could just move it yeah, just save it. i don't know how many are in the deck.
2 : you don't even have to use your helicopter lift
3 : so just ok so just go
1 : just one move and then
3 : one
2 : you don't have to be on it you just have to be right here right?
3 : two
1 : yeah i it could be adjacent
2 : yeah so then one
3 : alright
3 : ok
2 : two
2 : and then
1 : two of then
3 : ok
3 : that's two and then
3 : that's it
1 : yeah you could just hang out there.
3 : another helicopter lift
2 : mkay
1 : ok and i have
3 : uh
1 : two of the fire so we only need
2 : ok
1 : one more
3 : yeah so
1 : that's good
3 : once my turn comes around i'll give it to you
1 : hopefully another one shows up too
3 : k
3 : whispering garden
3 : 
2 : whispering garden
1 : ah
1 : mm
3 : and
3 : cliffs of abandon
1 : cliffs of abandon
3 : 
2 : oh right here
3 : ok
1 : ok so
3 : alright
1 : do we have to
1 : ok so
1 : giving each other cards is one action right?
1 : umm but i guess i don't really
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : but you have to be on the same
2 : tile to give cards
1 : ok
1 : we don't really have anything
2 : yeah
1 : i guess i'll just shore up
1 : the one i'm on and the one beside us
3 : those ok
1 : ok so i'm
1 : there
1 : i don't know if there's anything else worth
2 : mm yeah
1 : doing
3 : you can
2 : unless you want to
3 : move to hers and then give her one if you want
1 : yeah
1 : that's one action that's
3 : give her the
1 : that yeah so it's three actions
3 : oh that's mine
1 : oh that's two, where's hers? oh you're here.
2 : oh wait but then you to give a card would be in another action
3 : yeah it is
3 : so yeah
2 : oh ok i see what you're saying.
1 : so there's one two and then
3 : so one and then
1 : three right?
2 : yeah
1 : ok super
3 : yeah
1 : and then draw
1 : two treasure deck
1 : cards
1 : thank you
2 : sorry
1 : got a lion ok cool i got the fire
3 : oh wow
1 : then draw flood
1 : so two flood cards
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon, where's temple of the moon
2 : ok
1 : ok and there
1 : ok
2 : yeah umm
2 : i'll do this one now so i can use it before it goes bad
2 : i don't have to be on it to use this right?
3 : sandbag
1 : sandbag's can shore up any one tile before it sinks.
1 : it doesn't say on there.
2 : ok so do you think we can just use it?
3 : yeah
1 : is it in the
1 : book at all?
2 : and it doesn't count as an action. so let's just do that.
3 : 
3 : yeah
2 : no ok
2 : alright and then
2 : is there
2 : really anything else i should do?
2 : cause i can't get all the way over there.
3 : ah yeah
1 : well i mean you're-you have two of the chalice and you're on the chalice you might as well just stay there.
3 : can't give her any
2 : no i'm here
1 : maybe you should get closer to the chalice? i don't know why i keep thinking
2 : ok
1 : you're gray
2 : so i'll just go, one two
3 : one, two
2 : oh i didn't use any of mine yet right?
3 : now
1 : yeah so just hang out on the
2 : so three
3 : three
2 : ok
1 : chalice maybe we draw soon
2 : and
2 : i gotta do this one
3 : one two three four, you have to get rid of one.
3 : one of them
1 : 
2 : that's only oh six
3 : cause you have one, two, three, of-yeah
2 : does it count? like you know how we have to use those right away? so does that count or no?
3 : are we allowed to give?
3 : yeah
2 : or should i just get rid of one of these?
3 : i don't know can you get rid of water's rise?
1 : which order did you draw them in? does that make a difference?
2 : oh i got water's rise first.
1 : then i think it's o
3 : what does it say?
1 : k
3 : you may only have five cards in your hand including treasure, special
3 : it said you must immediately choose and discard the extra cards to the treasure.
3 : you may use the power of a special action card before you discard it.
3 : so umm
3 : i guess yeah it's in order.
3 : discard the extra cards
2 : so but
3 : you have to disc
3 : which one did you pick first?
2 : i picked this one first so this one.
3 : ok so yeah
2 : ok and then we have to do this one so we can move that up a notch
1 : so it's at three
2 : yeah
1 : uh oh
2 : re-shuffle these
2 : and then
2 : discard the water's rise
2 : and then i still have to pick these and now it's three.
3 : three
1 : three
2 : whispering garden
2 : iron gate, we just lost iron gate
1 : whispering garden
1 : uh oh
2 : and cliffs of abandon can you put that over there?
1 : ok
2 : ok
3 : alright so i'll give her one
2 : you have to be, are you guys on the same one?
3 : oh yeah we have to be on the sa uh
2 : you can use your power though to fly there and then give it to her
3 : yeah so i'll do that
2 : you don't even need to use your helicopter lift thought you have that special power.
3 : oh yeah
1 : so you just
1 : move to the gate
3 : and
1 : and then
3 : that's one
3 : two
1 : it's two
3 : i could of used the if i didn't want to use another power i mean use a
2 : yeah
3 : it depends actually cause what else can i do?
3 : if i use one, two,
1 : can't you shore up something?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah so i guess i'll just
3 : use that
1 : well you're
3 : i mean use that as the first one.
3 : so i use one already
2 : ok but then giving her is two.
3 : giving her one
3 : cause i use this to move
2 : ok
1 : ok
3 : yeah
3 : and then this
1 : and then just shh
2 : and does that not count as a
2 : oh ok i see what you're saying
3 : yeah
1 : 
3 : and this can be
3 : two
1 : well you don't even have to move, if you're beside it you can just shore it up
3 : oh yeah ok
3 : two
3 : and should i shore this one up as well?
3 : i could move oh
1 : that's three i think right?
2 : ah
3 : two
2 : well this doesn't count as an action.
1 : the moving, oh that doesn't count. yeah then, might as well.
3 : yeah
3 : so
2 : but then that would be a
3 : three
2 : that'd be four
1 : oh so just
3 : three
2 : right?
2 : do you see what i'm saying? wait cause that didn't count but ok
1 : yeah
3 : oh yeah yeah move one ok.
2 : alright
1 : ok
2 : and then you're on the treasure.
3 : alright
1 : so many rules.
3 : so
3 : these two
3 : i don't have to use that yet anyway.
2 : yeah no you don't have to
1 : no i'll just save them.
3 : ok
3 : i have to take
3 : three
3 : can you pass me three?
1 : yeah three, one, two, three
3 : thanks
3 : lost lagoon
3 : temple of the moon
3 : and breaker's bridge
1 : uh oh
2 : where's breaker's?
1 : breaker's bri right here
2 : ok
1 : ok so i need to get to one of the fire ones.
2 : ok
3 : oh yeah
1 : where i'm here, where's, there's on and then then there's one
2 : right here or there.
3 : oh i should've probably
1 : oh
3 : flew you there
1 : let's see
2 : oh i didn't even think of that
3 : yeah
2 : one, two, three
3 : i mean you can
1 : i can
2 : 
3 : when we come back to mine
1 : one
2 : yeah you can wait till next turn and he can fly you there.
1 : two
3 : i'll fly you there.
1 : three
2 : and then right now you can just shore these up. do you see what i'm saying?
1 : one
1 : so ok
1 : one and then
1 : two
1 : should i just move one closer just
1 : yeah three
1 : draw two treasure cards
1 : i have two treasure cards
1 : so do i
1 : i can dis
1 : card any of these right?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : ok so we should probably
1 : which, which one should i discard?
3 : oh
3 : discard the
2 : the one
3 : the
3 : yeah that
1 : the cup?
1 : and keep the rock
2 : or do you think we should do the ?
3 : cause i could give her that you could give her
2 : should we
2 : discard the lion cause that's what we have the least of.
1 : yeah discard the lion but i have to discard another one right?
3 : yeah discard that
3 : yeah i was gonna say
2 : oh i didn't realize you had that many
1 : should i discard the rock or the
1 : chalice?
3 : chalice cause i have one of these so one, two, three, four, yeah
1 : chalice
1 : so then we'll have four
2 : ok
1 : ok
1 : and then three flood cards
1 : our poor island
1 : copper gate
1 : crimson forest and howling garden
1 : so crimson forest
2 : crimson forest
1 : howling garden
2 : ok
1 : ok dokey
2 : alright do i should i give anybody my no
2 : do i ahould i move somewhere?
2 : should i just
1 : yeah you could probably shore that one up.
3 : yeah shore that up
2 : so that's one
2 : oh wait i don't have to move right ok so that'd be.
3 : yeah
2 : one
3 : and you can also move towards
1 : yeah those three should probably
3 : one of those and shore them
2 : ok
2 : two three, but i can't actually do it this turn right?
1 : oh well, well you're closer to it, i guess that helps.
2 : yeah
3 : oh yeah
3 : can
3 : you can't shore up diagonal?
1 : no, it has to be adjacent
2 : no
3 : ok
2 : oh no
2 : ok but i get rid of this one cause we don't even need that many
1 : yeah we only need the four fires.
2 : but i have to move this up
3 : wait did you,how much did you
3 : did you pull this one last?
2 : yeah but don't you have to take two every time?
3 : ok
2 : right?
1 : mmhmm
3 : no i mean don't you discard the last one you pulled?
2 : oh really?
3 : yeah
3 : that's how we did it last time
2 : ok so we don't have to, are you sure we don't have to go through with it?
1 : i think we have to always do the waters.
3 : yeah
1 : rise
3 : oh yeah well
1 : yeah is it five before we take the action or after we take the action?
2 : you do not get a replacement card if you 
2 : i have no idea
2 : i don't know
1 : it does say you may use the
1 : power of a special action card before you discard it which makes it sound like
1 : that wouldn't
1 : count toward the five?
3 : i feel like umm
3 : when you choose six
1 : hmm
3 : first you must immediately take away one
3 : and then use the water's rise
3 : so like we take away
3 : the one we
2 : oh so still use the water's rise
3 : yeah i say
3 : i say take away that one
2 : this one?
3 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : let's put it in this pile?
3 : yeah
2 : 
2 : oh ok
1 : 
3 : ah
2 : alright so we have to play this one.
2 : alright
2 : so we move it up
2 : to re-shuffle
1 :  and see if it counts towards the five or not
3 : yeah i think it does
1 : six
3 : yeah cause it's a special action
1 : oh yeah if you ever have six or more you must immediately
3 : yeah
1 : choose
1 : to use one ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : and now we're up to three still. lost lagoon
1 : cool
1 : lost lagoon
2 : copper gate
1 : copper gate, nnhmm
3 : so that's just gone
2 : and cliffs of abandon
1 : ok
2 : right there
2 : ok and then it's your turn so remember we have to move here yeah
1 : sweet
3 : alright so i'll f
3 : i'll fly you
1 : i need to go from here to
1 : to you and you are
3 : yeah
2 : ok so that's one
1 : you don't need to be on the same one as me to fly me
3 : no
1 : ok cool
3 : i could just fly you and then
3 : oh yeah when it's your turn
1 : mmhmm
3 : i can give you this
2 : you have to be on the same thing as me.
3 : us? ok
3 : so i'll fly over to you
3 : oh that's you
3 : that's one
2 : ok
3 : two
3 : and then
3 : my third one, i'll shore up
3 : this
1 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : and then do you want to
3 : two treasure
1 : two treasure cards
2 : oh we're still on it
1 : i know it's only just to get a treasure
3 : another helicopter lift
3 : alright, ok
2 : and then
3 : do we need a helicopter lift at all?
1 : i don't know, we should definitely save some
3 : oh wait i can't do it now anyway
2 : right now
3 : can oh yeah i can
2 : oh because it doesn't count
2 : umm
3 : oh and i could do a sandbag
3 : think i should just use a sandbag?
1 : to like save the treasure one maybe?
3 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : and then helicopter lift
3 : anybody need uh
1 : no but i just need to get the fire treasure
3 : i feel like i should move you though
2 : to here?
3 : to
2 : ok
3 : to shore up one of these so i'll do that
2 : sounds good
3 : ok
3 : 
3 : and plus you have these three anyway for
2 : yeah ok and then three of these
2 : let's hope it's not temple of the moon though
3 : wow
2 : is it temple of the moon?
1 : uh oh
3 : yup
1 : uh oh gotta swim
3 : our luck
2 : so i just have to
2 : go to this one?
1 : move
2 : right?
1 : i wouldn't move to that one cause if that one sinks and you're dead, i would move to that one.
2 : oh
2 : ok
3 : howling garden
2 : where is that one, ok
3 : and
3 : breaker's bridge
1 : uh breaker's bridge
3 : ok
1 : ok
2 : alright
1 : so definitely
1 : capturing this treasure
1 : so discard these into the treasure
1 : card pile
1 : and i'm on that so
1 : what do we do with the treasure we've captured?
3 : i guess just leave it where ever
1 : just
1 : hang out there
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : ok so that was one
1 : cool
3 : that was one
1 : is one
3 : oh you can give her one
1 : yeah
3 : but then she'll have to discard
2 : but only if she's on the same
3 : oh yeah
1 : where are you you're the
2 : all the way there
1 : gray
2 : yeah so
3 : one, two
1 : hmm
1 : where is it? yeah
3 : oh you can only move two
2 : you might as well like try to
2 : save something
3 : yeah save, save two
1 : like that
2 : you can save up to two right?
1 : umm so
3 : save
3 : these two
2 : oh but you have to be
2 : i see
3 : you have to be
3 : adjacent
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok well then at least
3 : so that'd be one
3 : and
3 : that'd be two right?
1 : mmhmm, like every one
3 : ok
1 : but maybe we should
1 : save that one since it is
3 : uh
1 : one of the treasure cards
3 : so
3 : one and two
1 : yeah i don't know
3 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : two of these
1 : two of those oh cool
1 : and then
1 : three, we're at three still right?
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok
1 : cave of embers
1 : crimson forest and whispering garden
2 : where's crimson forest
2 : is it crimson forest can i have that card cause that just sank.
1 : and whispering uh oh
2 : alright
3 : do we still have, so we have that, that, that
3 : oh so we already took that one out so it doesn't matter
1 : ok
3 : we just need to worry about those
2 : yeah
1 : mmhmm but if that one goes you won't have a way of getting to that
2 : ok well i can give you
3 : oh i can fly
2 : it's my turn right?
3 : or
1 : ok
3 : yeah
2 : messenger
2 : does it say how many i'm allowed to
2 : give? it says it counts as one action, can i give her
2 : can i give you two cards in the same
1 : i think so cause i discarded four in the same action.
3 : yeah
2 : turn?
3 : so i'll be yeah that'll be two.
2 : i guess i can give you
2 : one
1 : cool so we
2 : two
3 : two
1 : have enough for that
1 : chalice
2 : and should i move or should i just
1 : now
3 : wait oh are you
3 : do you have to be on the same one as her?
2 : i have that power though
3 : uh
3 : oh ok alright
2 : should i move or should i just stay where i am?
2 : i guess closer so i can try to shore that up.
1 : yeah might as well
3 : yeah and then
1 : this yeah
2 : ok or actually i'm gonna move this way so that i can get to there
3 : that's three ok
2 : ok
2 : and then
2 : and then
3 : three
2 : silver gate
2 : and coral palace
1 : mm
2 : any of those
2 : oh silver gate
2 : ok
1 : ok so we didn't lose anything at least
3 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : so
3 : so probably
1 : i'd try to shore up some stuff
2 : fly yeah fly somewhere and try this to get those
3 : shore up
3 : so
1 : once you're there you can just shore up that one and then that two
3 : yeah so one
3 : two
1 : or you can move if you wanted
3 : and then just fly
2 : wait where were you?
1 : you can flip an island.
2 : oh
2 : see you're this is me, you're here
1 : oh
3 : oh yeah ok
1 : i don't know why i keep
2 : so you have to move
1 : the blue and gray
3 : i could shh
3 : shore up this
2 : yeah as one
1 : mmhmm
3 : you don't even
3 : shouldn't care about that at all, so
1 : yeah since we already
1 : you might as well just move and then
2 : oh
3 : so
2 : so
2 : you can fly
3 : so
3 : move here
3 : and then do
2 : yeah
1 : that and that
3 : one
3 : two is three
2 : ok
3 : i take two treasure
3 : ok
2 : right and then you need three of these
3 : ok
1 : nnhmm what are we losing now.
2 : temple of the sun, got it.
3 : temple of the sun
2 : we need to save that one cause it
3 : ok
2 : we need that
1 : no yeah
1 : that's lost
3 : bronze gate
1 : bronze gate
3 : and tidal place
1 : hmm
1 : nnhmm
3 : so
3 : ok
2 : ok it's your turn
2 : ok so we
2 : can get
2 : there but we also need to save this one before it's completely gone
1 : so
2 : so could you go like one?
1 : ok yeah so
1 : one
2 : but then we couldn't cash in
1 : two
2 : then you couldn't get your thing yet
3 : two and then three
3 : three
1 : but i
2 : but you couldn't actually get it
1 : can't cash until next time
3 : oh you couldn't so you should just go straight
1 : undo that?
2 : just go for it.
3 : and just do one two and then just cash them in
1 : i was here?
2 : yeah one,
3 : yeah so one
1 : one two
3 : two
2 : two
1 : and then three
3 : and now
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : cool we got two of them
2 : ok
2 : and then
1 : just hopefully we don't lose the temple of the sun
2 : uh oh
1 : uh oh water's rising at least there's still three.
3 : oh do the helicopter for her.
2 : oh yeah that's a good idea.
1 : which how do i do it?
3 : bring her to here.
1 : wasn't that the end of my
3 : you could still use a helciopter to yeah
2 : that doesn't count as an action
1 : oh ok so
3 : this one
1 : move to here
2 : mm yeah
3 : yeah
1 : and then just discard this over there
2 : yeah
3 : but then she has to still wait until you give her that one
