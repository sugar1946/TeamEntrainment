4 : glad you caught it.
4 : umm wait which one do i need? iron gate, no. temple of the moon. is that right? yeah
1 : the moon
2 : yeah
4 : and then crimson forest, so
2 : so that's gone.
4 : oh  sorry
4 : umm and then could you put that over there?
1 : oh man
2 : so we gotta be careful with
2 : these.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah we should probably start shoring up.
4 : yeah
2 : probably
4 : start shoring some stuff.
1 : umm
2 : shoring up
4 : alright
1 : so
2 : k
1 : you're gonna give her your card next time and she's gonna move down there.
4 : yup i'm gonna give her that lion
1 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : umm
4 : this
1 : then you can move anywhere
2 : someone's gotta shore up this, this jazz
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
1 : i mean i can get
1 : to here
1 : i can do i can get to there,
1 : do both of them.
2 : shore up both
4 : ah do that
1 : umm but i wanna
1 : oh wait
1 : but i also wanna give you
1 : this or something else, i don't know.
1 : i'm just at five cards
4 : mm
4 : well
4 : if mm, i was gonna say if you head that way
3 : i can use the helicopter lift to save you the moving
2 : you probably
1 : if we all need one of those
2 : you can fly both of you
1 : oh that's true. but he can move anywhere anytime.
2 : so like each of you could shore up one.
4 : but he can shore up two.
2 : yeah
4 : umm
4 : i mean if you're gonna be over here i can give you one of these maybe and then you could get that guy.
1 : so
1 : i would just have an odd collection of things right? we've got
1 : five here
2 : mmhmm
1 : uh and
4 : mmhmm
1 : and
1 : five there,
1 : or four.
2 : four yeah 
4 : four, yeah
1 : if i get we could
1 : but we can get this almost near immediately if i give
1 : how many cards are you able to give
1 : per action? one
2 : well
4 : one
1 : right
2 : uh
1 : give a treasure card. i can give one treasure card.
1 : or 
1 : one.
2 : it says you can give away one action per card so you can give away three,
2 : if you're on the same card.
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
2 : i mean you could give
2 : oh wait i don't have the thing, the.
2 : i mean you can give her
1 : does anyone have a
2 : one of them?
1 : a preference?
2 : no
4 : for
4 : i don't even a preference for what? i don't even know what we're talking about.
1 : so i can move here and do those or i can try to give you or
4 : mmhmm
1 : stay near you so i can get some cards.
2 : i think this makes more sense to move there because otherwise if we lose
4 : yeah i think you should just go ahead and do that.
4 : yeah cause these guys, just go do that
2 : both of these or one of them, it's just gonna be it's just gonna suck.
1 : ok
1 : do it
1 : ok
1 : the messenger can give anyone a card at anytime
4 : yeah i'm good with that.
2 : what do you think pilot?
1 : right or
4 : mm
2 : uh is that my thing?
2 : give a treasure card to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card
1 : yeah
4 : right so that's during her turn.
2 : so i still
1 : well you two are close you can start passing things so it's a little deal
4 : no, it's fine.
1 : that's three actions
4 : cool, thanks 
2 : cool
1 : ok
4 : does that count as three or have you flipped two, is it still one?
1 : that's one action
2 : it's still
2 : three yeah, unfortunately.
1 : yeah
4 : oh ok
1 : umm ok
1 : and
1 : what's the next step? two treasure cards right?
2 : yeah
1 : so i'm gonna have to discard some cards here
2 : yeah you're gonna have to do something with them.
1 : umm
1 : did
1 : for some reason i thought these do not count.
1 : it does not
1 : that was action card
4 : it doesn't count as an action
1 : but you still only can have five right?
3 : mm
2 : yeah you're at six
2 : no you're at seven.
4 : seven.
2 : you're over achieving like a bandit
1 : yeah 
4 : so i have to get rid of two
1 : i need to get rid of two
1 : umm
2 : do you literally like discard them then?
1 : yeah  just
1 : go away
1 : uh i'm inclined to hang on to this cause there's three of em
4 : mm
4 : yeah i was gonna say
3 : mmhmm
2 : you don't need to have three of them though
1 : umm
4 : well if he gets one more he'll be able to grab one
1 : he can
1 : so she can give you
2 : yeah that's true
1 : a card
1 : and he can give me a card.
1 : i can have four
1 : of these
4 : yeah
1 : at some point, i don't know, i'm really close.
2 : it's up to you
4 : you're so close
1 : so we could get
1 : at least the chalice sometime soon, if i, if i chill or hang out near there.
2 : so what do you think
4 : yeah
4 : i don't know dude, if i were you i'd get rid of these two because this guys seems kinda irrelevant. you know we're not really messing with that little fire stone guy yet.
3 : mm
1 : alright
1 : i'm done
2 : and uh this go here
1 : alright
3 : did you move the blue pawn?
1 : yes
2 : he did, yeah
3 : ok you're red
1 : oh
2 : oh dear
4 : easy fix
1 : hopefully
3 : yeah, easy fix, it's fine.
1 : let's get
1 : umm
1 : i know what color i am.
1 : red
2 : nice
1 : uh
1 : alright now i need to draw three
2 : nice
1 : mm
1 : ok uh
1 : sun
2 : this one?
1 : this 
1 : tidal temple, alright well i'm right here so that's a good thing.
4 : yeah that's actually really convenient.
1 : and breaker bridge
2 : thank goodness.
4 : awesome.
2 : you know it could've been bad.
4 : good thing you shored em up or they'd be gone.
2 : cool
2 : ok
2 : so i'm this dude
4 : right
4 : i wish you could move to me to get it
4 : and then
2 : yeah
1 : but
4 : but it'll you won't have enough turns so you'll just be standing there
1 : well i think you have to give on your turn
1 : give, give a treasure card as a a action.
4 : do i?
4 : oh maybe you're right. ok
2 : yeah it'll be better because then i can move like here
1 : and you can move diagonally still
4 : mmhmm
2 : and then i'll just chill and you can just go diagonally.
4 : yeah, that's cool.
2 : ok so i'll just go
2 : here, sorry i'm not helping with the shoring up stuff guys.
2 : i wish i could but you know
4 : my bad
2 : so i
2 : i think that's it
4 : mm yeah
2 : for me.
4 : unless you wanna give a card to anybody but i don't think
2 : i don't really have anything to give you guys can't take it anyway unfortunately.
4 : yeah
4 : but
4 : mmhmm
2 : you only got one little flaming rock
4 : the flaming rock

2 : uh
2 : well
1 : yeah but there's
2 : boogers
1 : it
1 : he has one and she has one of the golden
4 : yeah
2 : but then they'd both have to give it to me
1 : that's ok, that's
2 : that sounds really weird
1 : yeah
2 : ok i guess he can move two and then give me his thing but i'm nervous about all the little islands going bye bye
1 : yup
4 : mm
4 : i mean
4 : you're gonna have, have
2 : i gotta get rid of
4 : pretty much have to get rid of a flame rock cause you're already sitting with the other dude.
2 : umm
2 : well
2 : we gotta use the flame rock at some point.
4 : yeah
2 : and there's two lions and then we can get rid of the flaming rocks.
2 : what's everybody else think?
1 : i would say get rid of the rock
4 : i mean
3 : umm
4 : i would say get rick of the rock casue you're already there, yeah
2 : get rid of the flaming rock?
3 : i would say get rid of the yeah
2 : get rid of the flaming rock?
3 : plus we have two flaming rocks left and only one lion
1 : yeah
1 : then
1 : yeah if we lose that lion we'll lose. well we don't lose right away but we will, soon
4 : yeah
2 : ok, let's uh, let's get rid of the flaming rock
4 : alright good job guys
2 : we got rid of the flaming rock. uh ok so then we do

2 : oh thank god
1 : oh yeah
2 : ok
2 : dunes of deception

1 : are we able to play these cards outside of our turns?
2 : umm
3 : it says you can play it anytime.
1 : yeah
2 : i mean you can if you want to
3 : so
4 : i mean un unless you wanna
4 : shore things up since there's a bunch because i'm right there so then i can just move after your turn cause she's not gonna be able to use it until her turn
3 : mm
2 : that's true
3 : that's true, i'll just shore things up cause all these are flooded.
2 : like whatever
4 : yeah i would think that'd be the better idea.
2 : i would, i would
3 : so
2 : mm like
2 : yeah
3 : move
3 : here,
2 : definitely turn over that temple
3 : shore up one, so that's two moves, i can shore up one more.
4 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
1 : i'd do the one you're on yeah
3 : mm shore
3 : breaker's bridge
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : and
4 : and then that's good cause i can shore up that one.
2 : and then you're gonna move
4 : mmhmm
3 : now i draw treasure cards but i am gonna have to discard somethings.
2 : we're great
3 : we don't really need that.
2 : nope
3 : and
2 : mm
2 : there's already four of those rocks out there
3 : do i really need two helicopter lifts?
1 : probably not
3 : yeah, that's what i'm thinking.
2 : 
1 : i've got one too.
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
3 : and we need to keep one of this to win the game.
2 : so we need one to leave
1 : yes
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : so we don't just fly off the island?
1 : no
3 : no we need this card
4 : nnhmm
2 : ok we need the thing
1 : yeah yeah back to the fool's landing
4 : yeah, we have to have the means to do so

3 : yeah
1 : what are what are we supposed to do with
2 : umm what are we supposed to do with the lion?
4 : i think it's just ours now.
3 : i guess we just hold onto it, yeah
2 : can we can we put it on the island? can we?
4 : alright
3 : it's all yours.
2 : can it chill there?
1 : i uh i don't know?
3 : yeah it's not hurting anyone.
4 : yeah we could do that
2 : oh it's cute
1 : i mean yeah
2 : yeah
2 : let it
2 : it's adorable.
4 : let it stay
1 : what does it say we're supposed to do when we capture it?
2 : i captured it
2 : that's a good question there's a booklet
1 : you're supposed to put it somewhere?
4 : i think it just takes the
3 : i'm not too worried about it.
4 : action and
4 : i feel like that's the one instruction we didn't receive.
2 : mm shoot
4 : umm
4 : uh i mean doesn't it kind of not matter it's
2 : ok
4 : just kind of an aesthetic choice.
2 : ok, it i guess it's not a biggie. ok i have plenty of space.
1 : yeah
4 : awesome.
2 : ok so that counts as one.
1 : yup
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
2 : umm i should
2 : i'm the gray one, right?
1 : do you need to give anyone anything now?
4 : nnhmm
2 : umm
2 : yeah i
2 : i don't have any
2 : you guys don't have any space
4 : nnhmm
2 : umm so i'm gonna move
2 : here
2 : and i'll just
2 : i'm just gonna shore it up anyway, there's nothing else there's no big difference anyway. i don't know
4 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : and then draw two
2 : i got another flaming rock.
4 : oh
2 : and a purple thing.
2 : cool and then three of these
2 : so we have the cave of embers
4 : that's gone.
2 : ok so we lost the flaming rock oop sorry
3 : still one more.
2 : umm the silver gate
1 : lost that
2 : and the dunes of deception, which is this guy.
4 : thank you
2 : yeah
2 : this island is really
2 : going quickly.
4 : umm
3 : ok
3 : my turn, i'm gonna fly
3 : over here
4 : mmhmm
3 : that's one move, shore this up
2 : nice
3 : shore this up
2 : great
3 : and now we draw cards.
3 : sandbags,
3 : and
3 : mm i'm just gonna get rid of both the flaming rocks.
3 : well actually
3 : yeah.
1 : so
3 : i'm just gonna
1 : you can use your special cards immediately, it says
3 : get rid of both
2 : that's a good plan.
1 : if you wanna use the sandbag instead of just getting rid of it
3 : actually
3 : yeah
2 : what's the sandbag?
3 : it
3 : shores up any tile on the island.
1 : 
1 : before you discard it.
2 : i don't know the ones that are bad
3 : this one's totally useless
1 : yeah, and that one's near useless too but if we wanna get here ever
2 : are none of them are useful.
3 : yeah so
4 : yeah
2 : put that one's there
3 : use this
3 : shore this up.
1 : might as well at least use it, instead of discarding it.
2 : i guess that's makes sense.
4 : why not?
3 : and then i still have to discard one either way.
2 : and you get rid of them
4 : ok
2 : flaming rock
3 : and now i need three flood cards please
2 : mmhmm
1 : ooo
3 : watchtower
2 : where's that?
3 : mm
1 : i don't know.
3 : right here.
2 : mk
1 : it's the first time we've drawn that card.
3 : uh bronze gate
2 : mm
3 : that's dead.
3 : and the cave of shadows.
2 : k
4 : mm
1 : i feel like this is gonna end real fast
3 : well we've
2 : oh well
2 : we only have ten minutes left
4 : yeah 
4 : i know
2 : and we only have a
2 : lion with wings
3 : we're close to the chalice
4 : umm
4 : yeah
4 : umm that's what i was gonna say, is like
4 : i don't know
3 : or maybe you should just chill there for a little bit
4 : yeah
3 : and someone can give you that for your next turn.
2 : i'm on the
4 : i'm pretty sure i can shore these two up diagonally, i can just do that. i can move and do that.
2 : if you move there
2 : oh there you go
4 : i mean
4 : and then somebody can try and come over here and give it to me or i can
1 : wouldn't
1 : ok
4 : oh
1 : do we wanna shore that one up?
3 : yeah we should probably shore up cave of shadows instead.
4 : yeah
4 : ok, you're right. yeah just
2 : let's get rid of that one yeah
3 : yeah dunes is
2 : that's a good idea.
4 : yeah i didn't even notice that. thanks guys
3 : ok
2 : that's a good idea.
4 : alright, perfect
1 : alright
1 : so
3 : two treasure cards
4 : oh thank you
1 : umm
4 : umm ok
3 : another chalice
3 : perfect.
4 : yeah
4 : isn't that convenient?
2 : oh yeah
4 : umm so i guess i'll just get rid of these guys
2 : yeah
4 : and then too bad i can't use that right now
2 : great
4 : but
2 : no, but that's great, cause you're on the thing
4 : when i can
3 : yeah
3 : next turn.
4 : alright, on to the next one.
2 : that's great
1 : well
1 : i'm gonna use
3 : now you need three flood cards.
1 : this doesn't count as an action, when i use this right?
2 : does it say?
3 : no it doesn't.
4 : i don't think it does
1 : so i can just move anyone whenever i feel like it right?
2 : does not count as an action
4 : oh yeah
3 : did you draw the flood card?
1 : including myself.
4 : i didn't
2 : yeah but there's no
3 : explorer
1 : oh
4 : i'm sorry
1 : wait
1 : let's
1 : wait until i do that.
2 : oh
4 : yeah here just take that back.
1 : until she does
4 : thank you
2 : yeah good reminder.
4 : umm ok so this guy
4 : and howling garden
1 : i was gonna say that was a
2 : whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
4 : oh i'm sorry
2 : no it's ok.
3 : howling garden's
4 : and umm
4 : misty marsh, so that's doesn't matter.
2 : eh, that's fine.
3 : ok
2 : great
4 : ok, now do your thing
3 : alright engineer
1 : so i'm gonna move over here
2 : you gonna do the same thing?
4 : uh huh
3 : well i'm, i'm blue.
1 : oh wait no she already has four
2 : you don't need to. yeah
1 : i don't need to anymore
4 : oh yeah now i have it, ok.
2 : you can
3 : and don't forget i'm blue
3 : you're, you're red.
1 : oh i don't know why i'm all about just moving blue.
4 : yeah
2 : you really
1 : maybe
1 : i think i'm blue, i don't know.
4 : well you could
4 : give
4 : him
2 : yeah go on the same
4 : that rock and then she can do it too
2 : thing
1 : well i,
2 : and give him the card
1 : either way
1 : i'm gonna move that
1 : because
1 : that does not count as a 
1 :  right?
2 : you flew?
2 : no it doesn't count as an action.
1 : ok
1 : so then
2 : you gonna shore those up? you don't need to shore those up.
4 : do we need to shore those up though? cause they don't do we won't ever go over there for anything.
1 : oh
3 : yeah we don't need those.
1 : will i just waste my helicopter card then?
2 : so
1 : oh
2 : i
2 : are you on the same tile as the pilot?
4 : well
2 : i would've just moved to the pilot tile and given him the purple rock
3 : i'm the pilot
4 : i was gonna say
4 : yeah and then she has one too so then he
1 : ok
1 : i didn't do that.
1 : edit, undo
2 : mm well
4 : eh i think we can fairly undo it
2 : i'm gonna ignore it, whatever.
1 : are we allowed to?
1 : alright i haven't done anything yet.
2 : ok so you can still
4 : nothing has happened
3 : it's beginning of your turn.
2 : go.
1 : umm
1 : alright
4 : so i would just move and give him that
2 : i would give him the purple rock.
4 : rock and then
4 : she can give him purple rock too.
3 : and then i can discard this.
2 : yeah, you don't need that.
1 : k that's one,
1 : that's two,
4 : awesome and then you can give it to anyone at anytime.
4 : perfect.
1 : and
1 : uh
2 : yeah
1 : i'm just gonna move back
2 : you could just
2 : you don't have to move at all if you don't want to.
1 : well i'd rather be more center to everything cause i can
2 : that's a good idea.
3 : yeah
4 : i guess do we all have to get to this fool's landing to leave? so just hang out.
1 : un undo things.
3 : yeah we all have to go there.
2 : yeah
1 : umm
2 : there you go.
1 : now i have to draw two of those.
2 : there you go.
1 : oh my gosh i'm the worst at this game.
4 : aw, i don't think you're bad.
2 : you have picked every one of those i think.
1 : alright so
4 : someone has to.
1 : rises up
2 : oh boy
2 : well no one's on anything that's
1 : shuffle
2 : if anything's goes under it's ok.
4 : yeah
1 : here let me do that.
4 : yeah
3 : just as long as fool's landing doesn't sink.
1 : i don't know if it matters who does it but
1 : thanks.
2 : that's a good shuffle.
3 : yeah we have seven minutes.
1 : alright yeah
2 : ok
1 : well actually we're pretty safe right now.
4 : yeah i feel pretty good
1 : cause
1 : i gotta draw four though. one
2 : oh we're up to four now.
1 : two
4 : i feel like we're on our way.
1 : three
1 : four.
2 : ok
1 : so
1 : uh dunes are gone
2 : cave of shadows,
1 : bridge flips,
1 : shadow flips.
1 : then watchtower flips.

2 : yeah, here's a rock.
1 : yeah
4 : cool. now you're so ready.

4 : you can if you want to.
3 : mm
1 : shore them both up.
2 : i guess there's no, there's no harm right?

2 : nice
1 : that's two
1 : and then you can move wherever you want so
2 : you can shore it up.

2 : or you could shore it up so that way it doesn't
1 : uh
3 : mm you don't
1 : it doesn't matter though, we only need three treasures.
2 : get flipped under.
2 : yeah but if it gets flipped over and he's on it, we lose.
1 : well he could just move to the island
4 : i thought he was just swimming.
3 : i can swim here.
2 : oh yeah
4 : yeah so
3 : so
1 : he should just move to the fool's island. that's where he has to go.
4 : you should just move towards it.
3 : for the last yeah
2 : well then do what
2 : can you move diagonally?
4 : wait you can't move diagonally though.

2 : that's true
1 : i imagine you probably just shuffle them back in but i don't know.
4 : yeah just, we can
4 : hold on to them, i guess.
3 : well we weren't inst we weren't instructed on that so, i'd say just ignore it
4 : yeah so i guess that doesn't
3 : and move on.
4 : umm
1 : i like that strategy cause then we win.
3 : yeah
2 : 
4 : wait what are we worried about?
2 : uh
3 : we're out of flood cards.
4 : oh
4 : weird
2 : if the flood pile runs out immediately shuffle it and stack the cards face down to form a new one.
3 : i see
1 : yeah i figured that's what you would
4 : ok
4 : let's go ahead and do that i guess.
2 : yeah
2 : oh gosh we have three minutes.
1 : draw two treasure cards
2 : draw two ooo yeah
2 : you have to draw two treasure cards
4 : i do?
2 : yeah

4 : but you can swim
4 : right?
3 : yup
2 : 
1 : yeah
4 : so
2 : i'm swimming out there.

4 : or is it?
3 : swimming does not count as an action.
2 : oh ok
4 : oh ok
4 : perfect, that's good.
1 : yeah
2 : we're doing great.
1 : and

2 : can you helicopter lift
3 : yeah you can lift her to there
2 : oh do that
3 : yes you can.

1 : yeah
3 : i didn't think we do it.
2 : i really didn't neither to be honest
1 : i thought we lost like very from the start
4 : yeah i didn't think 
2 : did you say what you thought we would lose right from the start?
1 : i was pretty syre
1 : eh, i don't know. we just like started losing tiles  right from the beggining
2 : you're so inspiring
1 : i was like oh man this is a bad game
