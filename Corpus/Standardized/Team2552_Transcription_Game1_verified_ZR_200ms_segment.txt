2 : you're up engineer
1 : mmhmm
3 : hmm
1 : do i have to take three actions?
3 : yeah
2 : so
2 : ah, what do you think you should do first?
3 : maybe we should shore up
3 : some
2 : yeah i mean i think we should definitely use the special, special power every time no matter what.
3 : hmm
3 : yeah
2 : so give up shore up two tiles
3 : yeah i don't
2 : yeah it has to be those two right?
3 : i mean you can still move on them like so she could move one and then shore up these two
2 : yeah that's very true
3 : but umm, yeah because we don't know which cards are coming up.
1 : now why?
1 : did you say i should move this?
2 : yeah well if you can only, you can only shore up things that are adjacent to you so you can either move first and then like shore up these two or just shore up these ones right here.
3 : ah
1 : so can i move this way?
2 : you can move that way but then you can only shore up one
2 : and that one, presumably, if you're on it.
3 : hmm
1 : oh ok i see what you're saying, so i can move, i can shore these two up
2 : yeah, yeah
2 : or you can shore these two up right now and then not have to move,
2 : then do something else.
3 : oh that's one action so she could move right after she shores up.
2 : yeah, yeah, i mean that you can move after you shore both of them up.
2 : so it's just a matter of which ones we wanna shore up first.
3 : so we could do is actually you could shore up these two right now
3 : then that's one action, and then move here
3 : that's and then shore up the next two. i think that might be best
2 : and shore up the next two? yeah, yeah, yeah do that
1 : uh
3 : you agree?
1 : i'm sorta lost. wouldn't that be four though?
3 : no, that's that'd be umm
2 : no, so you can move two per, two per turn. sorry. so that's one move right there, those two.
2 : second move is moving on this tile, third move is these two.
3 : because you that's your special, you can move two you can shore up two umm
2 : two per one turn.
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : so it'd be the double shore up as one move, moving is one move, and then the second double shore up is your third and final move.
1 : but i can only move two
1 : right?
2 : yeah, per one action. so one action, one action, one action, one action, one action.
2 : you can move mult you can unshore multiple, multiple tiles per turn.
1 : mmhmm
3 : that's an action. so like you're speacial is like you can
2 : yeah
3 : shore up two uh tiles and that's one action, and we have three actions. that's umm we have three actions, so you can shore up these two then you can move one right here.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : and then you can shore up these two and that'd be three actions total.
3 : and then you'd be done your turn and then
2 : and you can shore up an unlimited number of things per turn, per three actions
3 : mmhmm
2 : but per action you can do two, but we can only do one.
1 : mmhmm
1 : ok, yeah, so let me see what's happening
1 : ok now then i move here
2 : oh, yeah right there.
3 : yeah right there, that one there
1 : and then
3 : you can shore up those two again
2 : and then those two
1 : mmhmm
2 : cause you can do two at a time
3 : and that'd be all
1 : and then now what?
2 : so that's your third move, so then you
3 : and then you would yeah and then you would stay there and then you would pick up two of these.
1 : just stay there.
2 : you're done, yeah.
3 : uh yeah you can see it.
1 : and then
2 : so what are they
1 : uh yeah and the fire
2 : well you got a water's rise. alright so
3 : ooh
2 : alright so just hold onto the fire one, we'll notch this baby up,
2 : shuffle these,
3 : now that goes over here
2 : shuffle these
2 : throw that on top.
3 : mmhmm
3 : and then she has to draw two.
2 : yeah, you have to draw two of those yeah two of them.
3 : mmhmm
2 : mmhmm
2 : which ones?
1 : mm now i put these here
2 : alright gold gate
3 : uh
1 : so i have to move to the gold gate
2 : no they it gets flooded
3 : no, no
1 : oh wait, wait, wait
3 : those get flooded, so
3 : umm
2 : where's gold gate, gold gate, gold gate?
2 : maybe
1 : no here.
2 : yeah here it is. alright so it's, so it's gone now. alright
3 : no. oh that's gone.
2 : so that gets tossed in here and then
3 : mmhmm
3 : what's the next one?
2 : uh phantom rock, that gets tossed too.
3 : oh right.
2 : oh, that's unfortunate.
3 : yeah
2 : so uh, alright, so i'm up then.
3 : mmhmm
2 : alright so give treasure cards i don't uh so who has what?
3 : we don't have yeah
2 : i guess i'll give, i'll give her
1 : the fire
2 : that one
3 : oh yeah because she yeah, that's one action.
2 : so then uh what else can i do? i can move,
2 : shore up
2 : so i
3 : umm
3 : mm
2 : i can't shore up anything around me.
3 : yeah
2 : yeah so should i just move onto her
3 : maybe you could just umm
3 : yeah maybe uh move onto the same he, he's right here.
1 : where are you?
2 : yeah i'll, i'll just move this way cause i have a lion's card, that way i'll just move onto there.
3 : oh ok, yeah
2 : yeah i'm just closer
2 : alright so now i'll take two treasures, right?
3 : mmhmm
2 : perfect
3 : nice
3 : and then two yeah.
2 : temple of the moon,
3 : oh that's right here.
2 : then breaker's bridge.
2 : breaker's bridge
2 : ok, you're up.
3 : alright
3 : umm i have this
2 : so pilot
1 : well wait, wasn't that bad because now isn't it flooded?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah it's flooded but you can still stand on it.
3 : the problem is if, if the umm
2 : if we get a water's rise and it goes back in and then we get the same card again while it's flodded, it goes away.
3 : we get the rise again
3 : and then
3 : yeah so we need to worry about when this card comes out again
3 : then we have to worry about if like any cities are flooded then we need to
2 : sandbag
3 : mmhmm
3 : sandbag or you when it's your turn you can start shoring up.
2 : so i'm gonna save, i'm gonna save this.
3 : i think that's the best for an engineer, you can just start shoring up a lot of places.
2 : yeah, whatever you just shore up.
3 : mmhmm
2 : so i don't think you really need to
2 : move anywhere. i mean you
3 : i think we still, i think we might have to do oh take up to three actions umm
3 : yeah i'll just move over and just yeah
2 : yeah yeah, might as well.
3 : yeah
3 : and then uh that's two
3 : and
2 : then you can move anywhere so wait, what you'd wanna go to a uh
3 : umm
2 : one of these places since you have the
3 : yeah, i might as well
3 : umm
3 : yeah
2 : you can go to these are the only two i'm assuming.
3 : right
3 : yeah, i'll do this.
2 : oh and if
3 : uh umm
3 : mmhmm
2 : alright, if one of the treasure we have to make sure if one of the treasure things gets flooded that we have to shore it up immediately, or as soon as possible.
3 : yeah, yeah, yeah.
3 : ok
2 : alright so then you take two.
3 : uh i got a helicopter lift and then i got this.
2 : might as well just put one of those to the side too for when the game's over. just so we don't use it.
3 : i can
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah yeah
3 : and then oh yeah two.
3 : lost lagoon
2 :  cliffs of abandon.
3 : oh, cities of abandon, yeah.
2 : alright, so you're up.
2 : engineer.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mm that's a
1 : where could i go?
2 : move down
2 : and
3 : yeah i was thinking, move down, do the shh
2 : yeah, and then those two
3 : cause i have this card, so i'm gonna give this to oh wait she's gonna have
3 : wait, she yeah she can
3 : cause i think next i think if she draws her next two treasure cards she might get one of those fire or one of these.
3 : there's a chance for that so
2 : yeah
2 : yeah, so i mean, you might as well just give her the card.
3 : yeah well once it my turn, i can yeah
2 : oh yeah it's not your turn.
1 : alright so if i move down here
3 : mmhmm
2 : that's a move.
1 : then i can shore this up
3 : mmhmm
2 : and temple of the moon, in the same turn.
3 : you can do both, yeah.
2 : it's your special power.
1 : well don't but don't you get them shore up too?
2 : yeah, but he can only do one at a time.
3 : yeah we get to shore up, we only, we only can do one at a time. that's the, that's the engineer's like specialty.
2 : you could do two at a time.
1 : oh ok, so i can do two you both can do one.
3 : mm yeah, yeah, yeah
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : and that was two, you can do
2 : you have one more move, so you can either move onto the cave of shadows, lost lagoon, bronze gate, temple of the moon, or dunes of deception
2 : but not bronze gate.
3 : i think you should move here because you would get closer to me actually.
2 : yeah
2 : yeah sorry you could do that.
1 : oh where are you? you're the blue.
3 : i'm right here
2 : oh especially since you have the red cards too.
3 : mmhmm
2 : so you could draw two of
1 : then i also have the chalices
3 : yeah
2 : yeah but you're not around it, you can't move onto that.
1 : why not?
3 : now you
2 : because it's diagonal.
3 : because you can't move diagonal
3 : so you can't move you were here so you can't move here yet you have to move
3 : umm
1 : wait a minute, you said i'm here
3 : uh
2 : you were here, but you only had one move, you can't move diagonally, you can only move
3 : you were
1 : uh huh
2 : left, right, up and down
1 : mmhmm
2 : so
3 : that's why we moved here.
2 : yeah, that's why you moved there.
1 : oh ok, so i another time i can move here?
3 : mmhmm yeah, next turn yeah. yeah
2 : yeah, now you can, yeah, but here's your two cards.
3 : umm
2 : so what did i get? uh perfect
3 : oo perfect. oh wait that's six, so you need to discard one of them.
2 : uh oh
2 : get rid of the earth the stone yeah
3 : the stone
1 : this one, yeah.
3 : yeah get rid of the the stone. is it go here? i think yeah it goes
2 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : two
3 : of these
1 : so now i have to put whispering garden back
1 : umm where it was.
2 : whispering garden
3 : yeah
2 : what's the other one?
1 : eh iron gate
3 : ok
2 : and those go over here.
1 : and here
2 : no whispering garden we have to should i sandbag that right now?
2 : oh i'm next to it so
3 : no, not yet
3 : i don't i think we can we can use that anytime
3 : so i think once we get like uh
2 : alright so should i just undo it right now? just
3 : oh yeah you can do that, yeah do that
2 : so that's my first move now my second tre treasure card.
2 : uh i don't have any
3 : you can also do this if you want to
2 : yeah
3 : that's two.
2 : and no one else has these ones so there's no real, no real point
3 : no i no yeah. you can move somewhere if you want.
2 : us
2 : i'm gonna move back on that. might as well
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : so two of these.
2 :  yeah water's rise
3 : three
3 : yeah
2 : three?, oh yeah
2 : whispering garden again, so flip me over, if you don't mind.
3 : oh that was good.
2 : uh breaker's bridge
2 : next to her. uh engineer.
3 : oh right
2 : it's engineer and iron gate's done with.
3 : oh man
3 : oh
3 : ok yeah, mmhmm
2 : ok yup
3 : alright
3 : umm
2 : so you're here
3 : i could
3 : go over here, give her
3 : a chalice
3 : and then she would have to get rid of one of the fires
3 : the fire umm
3 : treasure
3 : if we wanna do that.
1 : now how come
3 : and then she could and then on her next turn she can go here and then take a get the treasure, you know.
2 : get it. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1 : but
1 : why can you go from here to here?
2 : cause he's the pilot.
3 : because i'm a pilot, i can uh move anywhere.
1 : you can fly anywhere. oh ok
3 : yeah
2 : you can  one move
3 : yeah one move, yeah once.
2 : but you can't take any more right?
3 : no i can't take it only this is the uh
2 : ok, ok, ok, ok, ok
2 : so you might as well yeah, go there, give that to her.
3 : mmhmm
3 : and then uh
2 : and then breaker's bridge
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : yeah and then
3 : umm yeah might as well.
2 : i mean, yeah uh
3 : that's three
2 : yup
2 : two of those
3 : umm
3 : yeah,.
3 : i guess
3 : uh temple of the moon,
3 : uh cliffs of abandon,
3 : and lost lagoon is over there.
2 : you're up engineer.
1 : so now i can move down here?
3 : yeah you can move down there.
2 : yeah
3 : and then
2 : cash in those four.
3 : you can
2 : those four chalices over there. and we can take this.
3 : yeah i think so, yeah
2 : so this is ours.
2 : so we'll discard those
3 : mmhmm
2 : umm
3 : now is what 
2 : does that count as a turn though?
3 : umm
2 : yup, capture a treasure, yup.
3 : ok, so that was two.
2 : so, that's two turns right there.
2 : so
2 : back to cave of shadows so she can
1 : well wait a minute, wait a minute,
1 : i
2 : so you moved. you moved down to coral palace.
1 : yeah but i didn't shore up two tiles.
2 : you don't have to shore up anything.
2 : i mean you don't have to
1 : why?
2 : because we wanna get the treasure.
3 : yeah our main mission is to get the treasure and
2 : yeah
3 : to get three of the at least three of the treasures and then we're trying to fly back home.
2 : so it's more important to get that treasure than to shore up those two things.
3 : for right now, cause we're gonna need to do that later.
2 : yeah
2 : so you moved as one move,
1 : mmhmm
2 : got the treasure as your second move,
2 : now your third move
2 : could either move to one of those three or to that one, that way you can shore up either one of them next time.
1 : ok
2 : so you can't shore up anything right now since you're not adjacent to any sunken so your only choice is to move somewhere.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : we could, uh i mean i don't think we have to, but we could move this. and then she could just like shore up
3 : with two of them. but i don't think
2 : yeah, oh yeah, to breaker's bridge.
3 : might now have to worry about them
3 : mmhmm
1 : but why would you use that now, the helicopter?
2 : the
3 : i mean
2 : that way, that way you would be able to shore up these two and that way the temple of the moon wouldn't get lost
3 : yeah, is that popped up actually? the temple, oh
2 : yeah it's
2 : it's still in, it's right there.
3 : ok
2 : so that's, that'd probably be that's a good move actually. but make sure we don't use
2 : the second helicopter.
3 : yeah
3 : because or we could wait for this the thing to pop up and then right away just use the sandbags.
2 : oh yeah we have a sandbag too.
3 : yeah
3 : so she could just move up and then just we can save our helicopter lifts.
2 : but then if she moves up she can only do one of those, as opposed to
3 : right,
3 : that's true.
2 : so what do we want to do? get the two now and
3 : yeah, i think yeah we can do that.
2 : bust it out.
3 : yeah
2 : sweet,
2 : do you mind if
3 : yeah do you, do you wanna do that? do you know what we were trying to use a helicopter lift so you get here right away
3 : and that doesn't take an action, so you still have one more action
3 : and then we can shore up these two.
1 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : so then we don't have to worry about them disappearing.
3 : alright
1 : ok, so now i'm going back here and then i'm gonna put these
2 : alright
2 : so discard the helicopter, so now you're there,
3 : mmhmm
2 : because he used that for you.
2 : mmhmm, those two. cause that's your special power, to open two.
1 : like this?
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : ok
2 : so now
2 : you get two of these
2 : and three of these.
3 : that was four.
2 : what? yeah
3 : mm, yeah
1 : so now copper gate,
1 : crimson forest, and i have to turn those over.
2 : which ones?
1 : coral palace or no, copper gate,
3 : oh right here, i got it.
1 : crimson forest,
3 : mmhmm
1 : and temple of the sun.
3 : temple of the sun, ok.
2 : oh, i have to sandbag that one soon.
3 : yeah
2 : ok, so my turn.
2 : so
2 : i shouldn't i should give you this treasure card right?
3 : i'm we can't oh you can. oh yeah you can.
2 : that's my power, so here, take that.
3 : one
2 : so then, i'm i flip him
3 : 
3 : yeah, that's probably the best idea.
2 : flip whispering garden, 
3 : 
3 : you or you can in you could flip
2 : i can flip yeah i mean
3 : this one.
3 : i think that's the only thing you can do actually.
2 : i don't i don't wanna move.
2 : yeah, that's it, alright.
3 : oh man.
2 : and we only have eighteen minutes.
3 : yeah
3 : what is that?
3 : aw man oh
2 : are we allowed to
2 : can we sandbag it?
3 : yeah oh yeah
3 : can we is that allowed? can we like sandbag before umm
2 : uh
3 : mm 
2 : like can we use it 
2 : aw
3 : ok
2 : no. alright
2 : good call, thank you.
2 : ah copper gate,
2 : let's see, copper gate.
3 : oh is
3 : oh man
2 : it's devestating.
3 : yeah
2 : temple of the moon ooo, we gotta shore that, shore that.
3 : yeah, we need that oh, yeah we need that.
2 : don't whatever we do, can't lose it.
3 : yeah
2 : that was mine, so you're up.
3 : umm did you
3 : pick up these two?
3 : oh ok
2 : yeah
2 : that and the rising water.
3 : umm
2 : so
3 : i mean i could give this
2 : to me
3 : yeah
2 : yeah give that to me.
2 : cause then she can give that to me and i can immediately cash out on that.
3 : yeah but can i
3 : don't, don't i have to fly over there to give it to you?
3 : or is that
2 : oh yeah
2 : yeah you would have to.
3 : yeah
2 : so you could fly, then give it to me, that's two turns.
3 : mmhmm
2 : and then you could could you fly back?
3 : i meand i could fly back here, yeah
3 : the problem is like if she has the other one, but she's pretty far away from you, she would have to take unless she
2 : oh yeah it's true.
2 : you could
2 : she's not on the
2 : she's not close to that either though.
3 : mmhmm
2 : could we helicopter oh we already used the helicopter. no
3 : yeah
2 : if i meet her in the middle maybe?
3 : yeah, maybe.
3 : so i think
3 : what i should do is
3 : fly over here,
2 : fly, give
3 : give it to you
3 : that's two and then maybe
3 : go down, or something. or fly somewhere else.
2 : or fly back
3 : yeah and then maybe on your turn you could umm
3 : mm
3 : i have
2 : so well, she would have to move she could
3 : oh wait, she could move here and then upshore, upshore that
2 : double, yeah
2 : and then move one more.
3 : and then move one more. yeah that might
2 : and then i would meet her at misty marsh and i
1 : but wouldn't i have to
1 : turn this one over?
3 : hmm?
1 : if i move up
1 : won't i have to flood that?
3 : no, no, no, no
2 : no, you don't have to flood anything. you never flood unless it gets picked from that.
2 : that's the only way you get flooded something
1 : oh
3 : so you like yeah you can flood the one on you're on top of, i'm pretty sure, and then you can do this one.
2 : yeah, ok, so you just wanna fly, give me that, ok
3 : yeah, i'll do that. that's one.
2 : one,
3 : two,
2 : two
3 : and then
2 : uh
3 : do you want me to
2 : you could i mean
1 : but, can't i give you this one?
3 : yeah, you have to be but you have to be next on the same tile as he is.
2 : yeah, but you have to be on the same tile.
3 : so i flew over here, gave him the card, and then i'm gonna move some
2 : i'm the only person that can give a card without being on the same tile since i'm the messenger.
2 : you two have to be on the same tile
1 : mmhmm
2 : to give me a card.
3 : and i'm probably gonna go
2 : you can go to the temple of the moon since that's what you have
3 : that's true, yeah
2 : oh and then
3 : oh, right, right, right
3 : oh yeah, we would have ywe would have yeah i would have to just go down there, yeah
2 : oh ok
2 : so it's just  misty marsh? ok, thank you.
2 : so you're at oh you gotta pick your
3 : oh right
3 : oh nice
3 : oh nice another helicopter lift. wait one, two, three, four oh wait i needa, oh wait i needa
2 : oh word, that's
2 : uh you gotta drop the sandbag man.
3 : drop the sandbag?
2 : i got a sandbag
3 : ok
2 : yeah the helicopter's crucial if we wanna
3 : yeah
2 : execute this plan.
3 : and oh yeah, three.
3 : crimson forest, alright got it.
3 : umm, lost lagoon
3 : and breaker's bridge. oh man
2 : alright
2 : so
2 : you're up engineer.
1 : so why can't i
1 : move here
3 : mmhmm
1 : and then i would be closer to here.
3 : because you don't have the,
3 : these three cards
1 : but i have this card, so how come i can't give it to him?
2 : because you're not on the same tile.
3 : because you need to you have to be, you have to be on the same tile.
1 : oh, so i gotta go all the way up here.
3 : yeah
3 : so i was think
2 : so we could helicopter you.
3 : yeah that might be a good choice.
3 : but we alright
2 : and then we immediatley cash in
2 : on that
3 : oh wait
1 : but then we would have two treasures.
3 : oh we should you know what we should do? so we go up here umm
2 : yeah, that's good.
2 : flood uh shore up.
3 : shore up, that's two. helicopter over here and then trade that, that's three.
2 : give yeah that's three. that's perfect yeah that's what we have to do.
3 : you're uh you wanna do that?
1 : so now
2 : just go up one, that's one move. shore up those two
1 : move up here
3 : yeah
3 : and then
1 : these two
3 : yeah
2 : uh huh
2 : and city i mean or breaker's bridge, whichever one. but that one's closer to the middle so
1 : ok
2 : and then
3 : and then we use the helicopter lift
2 : helicopter
3 : and then
2 : we're on the same thing
3 : right here
1 : and i give you this
3 : mmhmm and that's three. that's three turns
2 : three turns
3 : and then you get two
3 : oh nice, that's perfect

1 : or garden
1 : so now i sunk us didn't i?
2 : no
3 : no, not yet, it just flooded.
2 : we're flooded.
2 : but can't you get the thing if you're flooded.
3 : i think so, umm
2 : can you may catch the thing on a flooded tile. alright, that's perfect.
3 : ok
1 : and tidal place
2 : huh?
3 : oh tidal palace, alright
1 : palace?
3 : yeah
2 : so, i'm gonna cash it on the, on the
3 : mmhmm
2 : what, what's this dude, the wind dude?
3 : mmhmm
2 : so those go away, that's one.
3 : and then
1 : oh who's turn is it?
3 : it was his turn.
2 : it's my turn still so i have two moves left.
1 : oh ok
2 : oh
2 : oh, i did have way too many
2 : i had four of these
2 : oh yeah, i had
2 : why don't you take four of yes you have to get rid of this one. yeah we would have it.
3 : oh you just get rid of that one cause we already have that yeah sorry.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so then four, alright
3 : yeah
2 : so then we have sandbags
2 : umm
2 : so i just have to move twice or i could
3 : you, you could
2 : unshore
2 : i mean shore up.
3 : this i don't think we need anymore because yeah
2 : we don't need anymore, so might as well move
3 : down and then
2 : do we have to be on
2 : fool's landing to leave?
3 : ye
2 : no
3 : no, no, we just have to have this card and then we all have to be we
2 : yeah, yeah, ok
3 : probably all have to be on the same tile at the end.
3 : hmm
1 : but, we had to have be on the fool's landing to win.
3 : because you don't have you only can move umm
3 : but the helicopter  only can move if we're all on the same tile we can all move together but
3 : if we're in different tiles we can't win, so
2 : ok
2 : so uh i guess we should try and stick together if we all have to be on the same tile.
3 : mmhmm
3 : so umm, yeah i think you should just move down
3 : and maybe lift this up.
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : alright, dunes of deception
3 : oh
3 : ok
2 : cave of shadows,
1 : umm
1 : i think
1 : we have a lot of floods.
2 : hmm?
3 : yeah but
3 : it's it's fine if we have a lot of floods as long as they don't get
3 : these treasure because cause we have the straight path towards it.
2 : and silver gate
3 : silver gate
2 : ok, none of those, none of those matter.
3 : uh oh wait, one, two, three
2 : because
2 : yeah, that's rough.
2 : if she
3 : oh man
2 : oh
2 : got it. can wait if you move onto it and then you helicopter, or
3 : i can't helicopter anyone, yeah, yeah
2 : you can't, you can't pilot with someone? ah
3 : i mean we could sandbag that
3 : just to be safe.
3 : and then
2 : you want to?
3 : and then she just moves here and then we'll we just have to wait two more turns.
3 : you know what i'm saying? and then we just because this is the last thing we need
2 : yeah
3 : to  and then
2 : yeah
2 : so we just need to get here there as soon as possible.
3 : yeah
2 : so sandbag it, just
3 : just to be safe i guess. or
2 : if we sandbag it now, there's, there's
2 : no way that it can
2 : it could come back but then it would just be
3 : mmhmm and then it would just be flooded. and then we'll be on top like right next to her, yeah 
1 : but
2 : well yeah, yeah, yeah so
1 : can i be here and then
1 : turn these over?
2 : yeah but you uh it takes moves to move that, move there.
3 : you, you
2 : you can't yeah you still have to be adjacent to him
2 : to
2 : shore up, shore them up
2 : so should i use this?
3 : is it
1 : huh?
3 : i think
1 : i thought i could move
1 : to i could shore up
1 : two tiles for one action.
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah but you still have to be adajcent to them.
2 : you still have to be next to them.
