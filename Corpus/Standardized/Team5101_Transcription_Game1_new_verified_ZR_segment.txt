1 : ok
3 : alright
1 : so i'm gonna go ahead and move here
1 : and then
1 : turn these two up
1 : and since i already have two of the
1 : umm, the flame one's, i'm gonna move
1 : one space
1 : that way
1 : that's three mvoes.
1 : and cliffs of abandon and lost lagoon.
3 : that's not good
3 : ok
3 : alright
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : because we already have
2 : two of these, i'll start trying to move towards one of them
2 : that's there or there, right
2 : that one will be easier to get to
2 : so i'll move
2 : twice?
2 : and
2 : i think maybe, do we wanna shore up somewhere or
2 : i guess we don't
2 : i could just move three times to that, ok
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : this one
2 : alright
2 : uh
2 : so
2 : i just got these
2 : and
2 : two of these
2 : gold gate and whispering garden
2 : oh, so
2 : gold gate
3 : wow
2 : and i just realized you need to be on the same tile as me
2 : to give me that one
2 : so
1 : oh right
2 : yeah
3 : i mean, i can you can give it to me next turn
3 : if i come here
2 : ok
3 : or you can send them to me
3 : and she can come to me
2 : yeah, that's a good idea
2 : ok
3 : are there anything
3 : thing that i can shore up?
3 : or should i just
2 : i would maybe shore up the whispering garden since that's one with the
3 : ok so that'd be one
3 : two
3 : this is my third
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok
3 : you can give me that next turn
3 : one
3 : two
3 : ooo that
3 : beautiful
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : so i'm out of actions
1 : you wanna give me
3 : but you
1 : the flame?
2 : she's out of actions
3 : i'm out of actions or i definitely would.
1 : oh, just kidding, right
2 : oh yeah
2 : ok, so
3 : two, pretty please
2 : two
2 : you got
2 : the
2 : breaker's bridge and phantom rock
3 : k
2 : and phantom rock is gone
3 : shh
3 : oh man
2 : right, so now it's your turn again.
1 : ok
1 : what
1 : should i do?
2 : you're on the same tile so you should give
1 : yeah
1 : the
2 : her
1 : all three of them and just stay there?
2 : yeah, we could do that
3 : umm, no cause i have four. i'm gonna have to get rid of my helicopters.
1 : oh right
2 : oh, yeah, you'd have to get rid of two.
3 : umm
3 : where you guys at?
2 : i'm way over there
3 : uh
1 : mmhmm
2 : maybe give her
2 : both of those and you discard this one since
2 : that's the only well
2 : that's the only one we have right now and that would give us
1 : mmhmm
3 : oh, you're close to it
3 : umm
2 : mmhmm
3 : umm
3 : ok
3 : what
1 : wait, we can use the helicopters at any time
3 : i can fly you over to her
1 : too
1 : yeah?
3 : now
2 : ok
2 : well
2 : can you use it at any point, it doesn't have to ok.
3 : yeah, i can play this at any time
2 : ok
1 : mmhmm
3 : i wanna save one, just in case, like we have to get off the island
2 : yeah
2 : that's a good idea
3 : umm
2 : so maybe move me over to her?
2 : and she
3 : or
3 : her to you maybe?
3 : i can move you to her though
3 : yeah, you're gonna wanna
2 : or maybe you're right
2 : oh well, i yeah
3 : you're gonna wanna give her a card
1 : yeah
3 : cause you're gettin a full hand
2 : mmhmm
3 : and we want these
2 : mmhmm
3 : like it doesn't matter if i lose this one
1 : mmhmm
3 : and i'll be getting rid of this one to get her fires
2 : yeah, ok
3 : so we wanna get
3 : you to her.
3 : but you can always just trade
3 : from far away
2 : well i can give her one from far away. i can't take one.
1 : yeah
3 : oh, right right right
2 : but, yeah. ok
2 : so we could wait until my turn to give her that and you're right next to there. so if you wanna move
3 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
2 : one over after you
2 : you would give her those two cards?
1 : mmhmm
2 : so that's one action
1 : yeah
3 : that's two.
1 : two actions? yep
3 : it's per each card
2 : oh two. yeah, two, two
3 : and
3 : so i'm gonna get
3 : rid of
2 : mm
3 : and i'll get rid
3 : this
1 : and then
3 : and
1 : is anything else i need to do?
3 : you can
2 : i would maybe shore up that
1 : cause i'll shore this up if there's nothing else
2 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : and here's your two cards.
1 : iron gate and the temple of the moon
3 : we need to protect that one
2 : mmhmm
3 : so much iron gate
2 : yeah, that one doesn't matter
2 : ok
2 : so now my turn
2 : i can
2 : give you
2 : this one, because
2 : and that'll be my one action, my first action.
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : second action
1 : do you wanna start moving towards
1 : this?
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, yeah that's a good idea. i could do my next two would be moving twice
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : that makes sense
2 : and then maybe should i also use my sandbag since that doesn't count as a
2 : action to
3 : i'd say it'd be safe in case we get like a water's rise or something coming up
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : k
2 : so now two of
2 : these.
2 : i got a water's rise.
3 : ooo
2 : ok
2 : yeah
2 : uh
2 : the water level up
2 : one
3 : oh
2 : so now we're up to three
3 : k
2 : discard
2 : that
2 : and then now i do three
2 : so iron gate
2 : the iron gates gone
3 : k
2 : breaker's bridge
3 : 
2 : and whispering garden.
2 : which is
1 : that was
3 : right next to s, oh
2 : oh yeah, yeah.
2 : k
3 : so yeah
3 : two
3 : three
3 : umm
2 : so you wanna try and go more towards a fire one, then?
3 : yeah, should i shore up and then one, two?
1 : mmhmm
2 : because her turn she
3 : like one, two, three
3 : but
3 : i should stick with her yeah, cause i need that.
2 : but you shh yeah, you need to stay together.
1 : but then on my turn
3 : i can fly you
1 : yeah, i could just move the two over, also
2 : so you could shore up this, then
3 : and
2 : move one
3 : two
2 : two
2 : and then
2 : your turn, you could move one, two and give her the fire card
3 : met her
2 : as your third one.
1 : yeah
2 : wanna do that?
3 : yeah, we'll keep
3 : our eyes out
3 : for any
3 : treasure
3 : maybe we'll trade along the way
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok
3 : three actions
3 : that's helpful
2 : so you have to discard
3 : discard
3 : umm
3 : i'm biased because i like helicopters cause i'm a pilot
3 : but if anybody
3 : wants me to keep this, i can.
1 : i don't think it's necessary right now
2 : no
3 : we're ok?
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : so you still have to get rid of one more, though
2 : cause you can only have five
3 : yeah
3 : oh
2 : i'd say maybe get rid of a helicopter
3 : can i action at any time?
3 : like does this count as an anytime? can i just fly you to me?
1 : i think you have to
1 : i think you have to get rid of it first
3 : mm
3 : that stinks
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : before you can play again
3 : i should have used it.
1 : oh well
2 : ok, now
2 : three flood cards
3 : mmhmm
2 : k
2 : so, temple of the moon
2 : howling garden and crimson forest
2 : k
3 : k
2 : so, now your turn
1 : mmhmm
2 : you want to
2 : what did we say, move two and then give her the card
1 : ok
2 : then here
2 : your two
3 : i have to
3 : get rid of one
2 : oh, you do
3 : what would you guys prefer?
1 : i would say
1 : the rock statue
2 : yeah, me too
3 : ok
2 : cause i think we should always keep a helicopter, just in case.
3 : yeah
3 : i'm ok with that
3 : so my turn i can
1 : mmhmm
3 : get us a treasure
2 : yeah
1 : and then two of those
3 : good draw
2 : mmhmm
1 : 
1 : oops
1 : copper gate
1 : do we even have that yep
2 : oh ok
1 : uh, silver gate and cave of embers
2 : cave of embers is there
3 : mm
3 : we won't need that if we can get that
2 : yeah, yeah, that's true
2 : ok
3 : but we need to
3 : get you moving soon so you don't sink.
2 : i should
2 : shore up
3 : mmhmm
2 : maybe
2 : shore up
2 : for all three of my moves? shore up all three of these?
1 : yeah
1 : i don't see anything else, yeah
2 : because we're i'm not close to have these yet
3 : right
2 : since y we need to be next to each other for you or, on the same tile for you to give that to me
1 : mmhmm
2 : so i should just shore those up so that i don't get stranded
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : right
2 : and so that we don't lose that
2 : one
3 : right
2 : where's the oh did we already lose the oh no, it's down there
3 : where
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : so, if push comes to shove
2 : i could start moving
3 : you could send
3 : her the
2 : oh yeah that's true
3 : chalice
1 : 
2 : ok
3 : we'll f
2 : so now two of these
3 : yeah
2 : got another water's rise
3 : at least you shored those up, though.
2 : yeah, that's true
2 : three
2 : oh
2 : i did four
1 : that's the same thing
2 : whispering garden
3 : mm
2 : copper gate
2 : and the last one is cave of embers
3 : ooo
2 : so er, that one's gone
3 : that's ok
2 : yeah, that's fine. we're on the thing.
3 : cause we'll get we'll get the
1 : yeah
2 : thing
2 : k, so
2 : now it's
1 : mm
3 : me
2 : yep
2 : and you can do
1 : i say your first move should be to get the treasure
3 : yeah, turn these in
2 : mmhmm
3 : where do we put them?
2 : you put it right in front of you, i think.
3 : ok
3 : discard these
3 : all four
3 : umm
2 : so that's one action. you have two more
3 : i should
3 : go about
3 : shoring up things
2 : mmhmm
3 : do we want
3 : howling garden or whispering garden more?
1 : can't you only shore up
1 : the ones next to you?
2 : she can fly herself for
2 : she has two more actions so she can fly herself to one.
1 : ok
2 : what do you wanna do?
3 : umm
2 : i think maybe we should try and keep whispering garden since that connects
3 : right, cause we're all around it
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
2 : so
3 : so one, for my special
2 : mmhmm
3 : and then i'm gonna save it
3 : that was my third move
2 : k so two of those
2 : got your helicopter back
3 : woo
2 : so we have three of these now
3 : just gonna fly everywhere
2 : around us
1 : mmhmm
1 : and then
2 : oh yeah
1 : three
3 : yeah, we've gotten no chalices.
2 : go ahead
2 : we keep doing
2 : that
3 : alright, crimson forest, howling garden, woo
3 : and breaker's bridge.
2 : the howling garden is gone
1 : mmhmm
3 : breaker's bridge is gone
2 : oh no
3 : yeah
3 : uh
2 : oh, saving whispering garden didn't help
3 : ok
2 : that one's not 
3 : we'll be fine, without that one
3 : ok
3 : uh
3 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : now your turn.
1 : the only thing i can do i guess
1 : is
1 : move here
1 : or should i try to get closer to you guys, so i can get something?
1 : 
3 : 
3 : we only have like three of each thing
1 : mmhmm
3 : even if i fly people around, it doesn't do anything
1 : yeah
1 : i think i should just take the one move
1 : so at least i'm on this
2 : yeah
2 : you're gonna have to take two cards
1 : yeah
2 : and, that means you'll have to discard some
1 : oh
1 : these, yeah
2 : yeah, proba
2 : probably those
3 : yeah
2 : so
1 : which isn't too big of a deal
3 : our
3 : treasure luck hasn't been so good
2 : nnhmm
2 : ok, so you just wanna move one, and that's it?
1 : yeah
1 : yep
2 : ok
2 : here's your two
1 : oh, that works
2 : oh
3 : woo
1 : and i'll discard these two oh wait, no.
3 : now the chalices come out
1 : which one should i discard? the griffin or
2 : the another
2 : chalice, cause you only need four
3 : yeah
1 : no but i have
2 : oh, oh
1 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : well we have
1 : i'd say i keep this
3 : yeah, keep
1 : so then at least you can get closer to me
2 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : oh, yeah
2 : sorry
3 : it's good
1 : uh, temple of the moon
1 : silver gate and dunes of deception
2 : silver gate
2 : uh
2 : alright
3 : so we're waiting for your turn
2 : so, should i
2 : give
2 : no
3 : nnhmm
2 : i yeah, i can i should give you this card
3 : oh ok
2 : so at least we're starting to collect those
1 : or should you start moving
1 : towards me? cause then you could also be moving towards this
2 : the other one?
1 : yeah
2 : so we should stop worrying about temple of the moon
1 : yeah, cause i th as we as long as we save this one, it doesn't matter
2 : mmhmm
1 : cause like none of these we really
1 : need.
3 : what if
3 : we shore em up just in case cause once we start running out of those cards, these are gonna be more likely to come up
1 : mmhmm
1 : true
3 : so if you shore these up and i fly you over
3 : you're still not
3 : like, i fly you over for free
2 : yeah, that's true
3 : with one of these, so
3 : wherever you guys want to go to start, like, moving and trading and stuff
3 : i can get you
2 : ok
3 : there.
2 : so i
2 : should shore up?
3 : those three, and then i can fly you to her
2 : on your ok
3 : so cause you guys want
3 : these?
2 : well, yeah. i want her to give me that one
3 : right
3 : ok
1 : mmhmm
2 : alright
2 : so, shore up all three for my three
2 : for my three acttions
3 : and
3 : i'm gonna play my anytime card
3 : after you do that.
3 : and fly you
3 : to the coral palace
2 : and
3 : and then you're
2 : so now do these two.
3 : treasures
2 : ok
2 : so, i should discard
1 : mmhmm
2 : the chalice. yeah, i don't need that one
3 : chalice, we definitely don't need that
3 : oh and the
3 : fire oh wait. no, you got five
1 : wait
2 : i only need discard one, yeah
3 : you're good
2 : umm, ok so now
3 : awesome
1 : three
2 : three. oh no
3 : it's ok. we shored those up
2 : tidal palace
2 : bronze gate
2 : and coral palace, the one that we're on.
3 : mm
2 : k, so now your turn
3 : should i shore that up
3 : just so it makes it to her turn
3 : cause it would really stink to
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah yeah, i would
3 : to flood that before we get so that's
2 : just in case you get like a
3 : one action
2 : tidal rising one
3 : and then
2 : that's one
3 : i missed what you pointed at
1 : oh
1 : you don't have that power, to go diagonal
3 : oh, i'm blue.
2 : oh yeah, i was thinking you were gray too
3 : that makes sense, i was like
3 : i was like, i'm gray
2 : ok, ok
3 : uh, that makes sense. ok
3 : so i won't do that
2 : you could fly there for one
3 : as my special move
1 : mmhmm
2 : as your special move
2 : shore it up for a second move
3 : and then i'll be closer to you guys anyway
2 : or maybe do you want to fly to the tile we're on?
2 : because then, we could do some trades
1 : and then you could giver her the gri
3 : and then yeah, you can give me
1 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : and
3 : so, one
2 : two
3 : two
2 : what else do we need to do?
3 : 
1 : did you want to give her the
1 : griffin?
1 : at all?
2 : oh yeah
2 : you could give me the griffin, i could get rid of the fire
3 : oh
1 : mmhmm
3 : that works
3 : if i could pick it up
3 : three
1 : yep
3 : one, two
3 : those don't help
2 : then three of these
3 : three floods
2 : watch tower, misty march, and temple of the sun.
3 : sun
3 : misty marsh
3 : watch tower?
2 : mmhmm
1 : k
1 : go ahead and do this for my first move
1 : and then
1 : should i go ahead and give this to you?
3 : then she'd have six
2 : yeah, then uh then i'll have to get rid of one of the griffins, though. should i keep
1 : oh
1 : i could move here and then
1 : save this
3 : you could
1 : ok
1 : wait, am i?
2 : you're red
1 : red
2 : here's your two
3 : oh no
3 : we were doing so well without those cards
2 : we're not at four yet
2 : hopefully not misty march
2 : marsh
1 : silver gate
1 : temple of the moon
1 : and copper gate.
2 : ok, that was
3 : alirght island
3 : way to hang in there
2 : ok
2 : so now my turn
2 : so for my turn, i should give
2 : maybe i should give you these two
2 : since now you're closer to this.
1 : mmhmm
1 : wait you have to go to my tile first, don't you?
1 : oh, you're the messenger. just
2 : no i'm a messenger
3 : she's messenger
2 : but each card is one action. so that'll be two actions for me
1 : ok
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : so for a third action
2 : maybe start
1 : going towards the
1 : griffin?
2 : well yeah, maybe i should wait until your turn
1 : 
1 : so you can helicopter?
3 : yeah
3 : so
3 : i can start moving people out
3 : or maybe we wanna shore things
2 : i can't shore anything from where i am
3 : right
1 : i can
1 : move
1 : you guys
1 : with
1 : the helicopter cause we have two now.
2 : yeah, maybe move me first
2 : yeah
1 : this is move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile so i could move both of you guys, over to the griffin
3 : so that
2 : oh yeah, that's a good idea
3 : that'll be our best effort
2 : yeah
2 : and i i'll still have an action
1 : and you can shore something up
2 : yeah
1 : i guess silver gate
2 : i guess
3 : yeah
1 : so then you can at least, try to move
2 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : ok yeah, so
2 : just try and save the island
2 : alright
2 : these
2 : oh
3 : woo
2 : alright
3 : we did it
2 : we'll have to wait until my turn
1 : yeah
3 : that's ok
2 : unless i give oh no, i couldn't do that
1 : yeah
2 : never mind
2 : alright
2 : so
1 : then, three
2 : bronze gate, misty march, temple of the sun
1 : bronze gate's gone
3 : misty marsh
3 : gone
2 : alright
2 : so, your turn
3 : umm
3 : ok
3 : i can't really do much
2 : the only thing we really need to worry about is getting
3 : 
3 : making sure you can get those
2 : this
2 : yeah, making sure i can get those and making sure we can get back to here
1 : mmhmm
3 : which might be a tiny problem
2 : yeah, so maybe
1 : as long as we have a helicopter though, it's not
1 : too big of a deal if she gets
3 : but we also need to get off the island
2 : but we need yeah we need a helicopter to get off too
1 : do we?
2 : yes
1 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : so
2 : maybe
3 : i mean, cause i could fly myself away
2 : yeah
3 : but i can't take you with me
2 : you should
3 : with my special
2 : maybe use your special power to move back onto fool's landing
3 : think
2 : right now
3 : ok
2 : and maybe
2 : shore up something
3 : keep it
3 : safe
3 : yeah i was gonna say
2 : wait, i can't get back
2 : so we'll need to use a helicopter no matter what to transport me to fool's land oh no
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : we're just gonna have to that i
3 : i pull
1 : should you go to fool's landing or temple of the moon?
1 : i guess that doesn't matter cause it's not gonna
2 : no, temple of the moon we can't get to it anyway
1 : yeah, it's a lost cause
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : so yeah, i guess that's all you really need
1 : you can
2 : to do oh shore up shore up one
3 : i mean i could shore some of these
3 : like
1 : you can only do
1 : one of them
1 : unless you wanna go here
3 : i mean i'm gonna have to have another turn after this one anyways, so if i like use my special to come here
1 : mmhmm
3 : take care of these
2 : fair one
1 : yep
3 : for three
3 : and then next turn, i can just go one, two and get back
2 : ok yeah
1 : yeah
3 : cause the more we have in
3 : the better
3 : i think
1 : agreed
2 : that way you can get back
1 : mmhmm
3 : ooo sandbag
3 : ok
1 : and then
3 : yeah, then three me
2 : oop
2 : dunes of deception
1 : it's gone
2 : uh whispering garden
3 : mm
2 : and coral palace
2 : so we really need to make sure whispering garden doesn't go away by my turn
1 : mmhmm
1 : umm do you wanna use a sandbag on it?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : keep that safe
2 : mmhmm
3 : that was my turn
3 : ooo you're up
1 : yeah
1 : i don't really know if there's anything i can do except just move down here
2 : you don't need
3 : yeah
2 : we only need three
2 : we already have two and i have four of these
