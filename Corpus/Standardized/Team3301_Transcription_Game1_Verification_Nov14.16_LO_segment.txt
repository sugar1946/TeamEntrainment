2 : ok
3 : i've played the desert one.
2 : wait wait
3 : oh
2 : ok
1 : alright i start.
2 : yeah.
1 : so my first action i'm going to
1 : move
1 : here and then i'm going to move here.
1 : that's two actions
2 : ok
1 : then i'm gonna flip this
1 : and flip this. so can i have two treasure cards?
2 : yes
2 : here you go
1 : thanks.
1 : aw i got a water's rise card already.
2 : cool
1 : ok
1 : and
1 : discard this for me.
2 : uh oh
2 : i guess
1 : thanks and then wait
2 : and then
1 : shuffle these first, yeah.
2 : i get it
3 : so that was only
3 : was that two actions?
1 : yeah i still or no it was three. one, two and then
2 : hmm
1 : shore up.
3 : oh, oh, oh
2 : shh
1 : and i have to draw two of these so
1 : lost lagoon and golden gate sink
1 : someone help me find them.
3 : oh
1 : oh no!
2 : oh
3 : crap. mm
2 : well at least it's not like uh one of these yeah.
1 : good one yeah.
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : now i my turn.
2 : ok my turn.
2 : i will
3 : oh the
3 : gate
1 : oh
3 : the one that sunk.
2 : oh
1 : nice.
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : i'll give you the
1 : thank you.
2 : that card? ah
2 : and then i will
2 : move down
2 : and
2 : shore up?
1 : do you want to do this one too cause you're adjacent?
2 : i think i can only do one though. cause i'm not the engineer.
1 : oh that's right, yeah sorry that's my special power.
3 : did you
3 : yeah
1 : sorry about that.
2 : ok and then i draw two of these.
2 : umm
2 : ok i got
2 : sandbag and one of these.
2 : cool
3 : so if
1 : treasure card
1 : or yeah treasure
3 : flood
2 : oh my god. ok
1 : yeah
3 : i hope that nothing good sinks.
1 : ok
2 : i got two.
2 : breaker's bridge and whispering garden.
2 : ok breaker's bridge.
1 : so that's
1 : whispering garden's right here
3 : uh oh
2 : ok
2 : i'll use my sandbag for this guys
3 : uh
3 : i don't think you can use the sandbag if you already drew the flood.
2 : oh
3 : that's the
2 : oh ok sorry
1 : yeah
2 : ok breaker's bridge
2 : is
3 : it's this one.
2 : uh oh ok that one is gone.
1 : oh no
1 : so am i
2 : oh this one
1 : swim
2 : and then flood that one.
1 : and then flip this one cause.
3 : oh and that has a lion thingy on it.
2 : yeah wait so when can i use this? can shore up
1 : before you draw your flood
1 : cards
3 : so sooner rather than later because
2 : ok
1 : yeah
3 : once you draw the flood card it's like too late.
2 : oh ok
2 : so there's no saving that whispering garden.
1 : maybe fingers crossed.
3 : wait well s you can use it now.
2 : ok i can?
3 : after right, cause you can use it any time.
2 : yeah ok
3 : like you already flipped but then if you flip it back
1 : ok
2 : ok i will use it then.
1 : ok
1 : discard yeah
1 : there you go,ok.
2 : that is confusing ok.
1 : this is complicated.
2 : so i can't use it right after drawing the card but i can use it like
1 : yeah
2 : mm k
2 : cool
3 : generally
1 : i think
1 : ok
1 : pilot
1 : your turn
3 : oh was it?
1 : mmhmm.
2 : yes pilot.
3 : hello umm ok.
3 : so where am i?
3 : i'm going to use my
2 : do do you know what we should do?
1 : hmm
2 : we should like
2 : ok ne
3 : wait tell me
2 : like whenever i get like
2 : good cards, i should give them to you.
2 : because then you could fly to whatever
1 : yeah true.
2 : thing it is like even if it's not like close.
3 : well i mean
2 : i mean if it like
3 : the thing is we can only have
2 : oh yeah five
3 : five so
1 : five
3 : f
1 : i've got four right now.
3 : the
2 : ok
3 : yeah the engineer has like two different types of things going on so what it should be is like
2 : ok
2 : oh each person
3 : if you find one of these give it to me but if you find, you know, either of those
1 : either of these give them yeah
2 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : and then
2 : cool
3 : we'll start building up like who had four of what.
1 : yeah
2 : i see
2 : ok
3 : umm but i'm
3 : and then take a ah
3 : can we tell from the back of the
3 : flooded card if it has one of these things?
2 : yeah, yeah it has a little symbol so
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : it does? this one?
1 : mmhmm, that one doesn't only only the ones with the circles.
2 : so we might as well yeah
3 : ok so it doesn't matter if this one sinks basically
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : ok them i'm not
3 : gonna worry about it
3 : i guess
2 : that's the spirit
3 : umm ok
3 : but
3 : are we penalized
3 : if
3 : the outer edges sink really?
2 : i don't think so
1 : no
1 : as long as we're on the
2 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : then i'm not that worried about it, so
2 : ok
3 : umm what do i want to do?
3 : i guess
3 : where am i? i could move
3 : i'll use my special power for an action.
2 : ok
3 : i'll move here, just in case. whatever.
2 : cool
3 : and
3 : that's all the actions
2 : wait
1 : you don't have to take all three so
3 : yeah if
3 : if we're not trying to shore up
2 : mmhmm.
3 : any other
3 : is there any bene if there's not beenfit to shoring up things that aren't shored up.
2 : wait no you should
2 : like
2 : ok never mind i'm i'm like
2 : way over thinking this, ok.
3 : i'll just draw treasure and
2 : ok
1 : sounds good.
2 : cool
3 : get on with it.
3 : ok i got these two
3 : and you'll have four so at some point i'm gonna be using one or giving on away.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : and umm and now we do two of these.
2 : ok
2 : or wait oh, never mind.
3 : should i?
2 : i was thinking if you had given, if you had flown to where i am
2 : if you fly your card to where i am
2 : you could give me your fire thing and then i could my fire thing
2 : to the engineer so then she would have like
3 : oooo
2 : close you know?
3 : oh that's good.
2 : yeah
2 : but i don't know if you can do that since you already like drew the treasure cards and stuff, but
3 : ok
3 : umm once per turn
1 : yeah it's actions then treasure
3 : yeah
2 : yeah so i mean next turn you can we can like figure it out.
1 : yeah.
3 : yeah ok, ok so
3 : but i could fly, use this and fly you to me
1 : yeah
2 : that's true
3 : and do that. do you wanna do that?
2 : but i mean need sure.
3 : ok and then i'd get rid of an extra card and have more to discard later ok. less to, ok.
2 : yeah
2 : cool
3 : so i'm moving, i'm getting rid of this.
2 : ok
2 : and i'm here.
3 : umm
2 : yeah
3 : and you're
3 : oh but i already we already drew treasure cards so.
3 : i can't give you a card.
1 : no
2 : yeah but only for next turn yeah. yeah, yeah.
3 : because that's but next turn. ok, alrught
1 : but like
1 : preparing for next turn.
2 : ok
3 : umm so now we do flood cards
2 : ok
3 : phanton rock and cities of abandon. phantom rock nothing on it.
2 : no, who cares about that.
1 : it's cliffs of abandon but yeah
3 : or whoops.
2 : ok
3 : cliffs oh you flipped that, ok so phantom rock i just sunk and that goes there.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : and that goes to you and i'm done oh my god.
2 : ok
2 : it's a little confusing yeah. your turn
1 : alright my turn.
3 : hmm
1 : so i can do my actions
1 : so
1 : first action is to flip this.
1 : umm
1 : i don't know if i want, i don't think i want to move cause i've got these two so
2 : ok
1 : uh can i, two treasure cards? por favor
2 : yeah
2 : si, senorita.
1 : oh shoot!
2 : engineer
1 : you know what i should've done, i should've given one of these away.
2 : oh
1 : so i didn't have to discardoh
1 : one
1 : ok well
2 : oh well
3 : oh
1 : i guess wait i can keep five, i can keep five. oh i forgot about that. ok yeah, just discard that
3 : we're almost
2 : ok
2 : ok oh we are like close.
1 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : so now i draw my flood card
2 : or wait no move to the
1 : wait
1 : i already drew my thing so i can't do the action yet.
2 : oh, oh ok.
1 : yeah
1 : so
2 : i'm like getting way excited.
1 : it's a game, it's a good game. ok so iron gate.
2 : yeah
1 : or wait that's silver gate.
2 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : is iron iron gate's , so flip that for me please.
2 : iron, ok.
3 : this one.
2 : and that's a good one to fly.
3 : bye bye
1 : thank you and then
1 : temple of the moon oh no
2 : ok
3 : ok so we don't want this one to sink cause
1 : this goes here.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : no but
2 : or like we could just keep this one alive.
3 : well but then you risk what if that one sinks too. i think it's good to
1 : yeah ok so
2 : ok yeah.
3 : keep the special ones.
2 : ok my turn?
1 : messenger, it's your turn.
2 : umm
2 : i
2 : ok move. where am i? i can't
2 : i guess i'll move oh no wait i can't
2 : yeah i'll move, i'm move  fly, ok
3 : that's ok. i'll just come to you if you move somewhere.
2 : i'll move one.
2 : two, three.
2 : and that'll be my turn.
1 : yeah
2 : right?
2 : and then i'll take two of these.
2 : and water's rise oh no
1 : oh no, here i'll move it for you.
2 : ok
1 : we're on elite level, i don't know what that means.
2 : oh no
1 : so
2 : and shuffle the flood.
1 : yeah shuffle those.
1 : not that one though. yeah.
2 : ok oh wait ah
2 : i i like think that should be in this one because it's like you know water but
1 : yeah i know right.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : guess not
2 : yeah
2 : and then
2 : put it here.
3 : is there anything about these ever getting shuffled?
1 : no
3 : well it looks like there's a bajillion so it's fine
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : oh
2 : yeah ok cool
1 : so now you draw three of these.
1 : and sink things.
2 : oh no
3 : oh my gosh.
2 : ok cliffs of abandon, lost lagoon and whispering garden.
1 : thankfully these two don't
1 : and then
1 : take
2 : lost lagoon is gone.
1 : yeah
1 : here you go.
3 : bye lost lagoon.
2 : ok
3 : you're lost
1 : no
3 : oh that's it? i think that's it.
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : so
1 : pilot
1 : commence.
2 : yeah so commence our plan so.
3 : ok
1 : so just move to messenger.
3 : oh
2 : yeah fly over to me.
3 : yeah
2 : i think, right?
1 : wait who can fly? pilot can fly. that's one action. so that's your action.
2 : pilot yeah
3 : i can fly.
3 : one
1 : that's two
2 : that's two
3 : two
1 : nice
3 : and
3 : gosh darn it, i really wish i could get

2 : now
1 : no you can
3 : ok but maybe we'll get from the treasure.
2 : that's ok though cause we're all here so like maybe like someone if someone just stays on watchtower they could always shore up. engineer you should always you should be on watchtower and you can just shore up everything yeah.
1 : oh
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : mm
1 : yeah cause like that's close to these two yeah, ok
3 : wow oh that's true.

1 : palace,that, yeah that does matter cause this one's diagonal and we can't move diagonal.
2 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : but you're adjacent to it
1 : i'm adjacent to it so we can shore up.
2 : yeah
2 : i'll shore up wait.
1 : is
1 : oh yeah you should do that.
2 : yeah i'll just shore it up.
3 : yeah. the sooner the better.

2 : umm
1 : good call
2 : where am i i'm right here.
2 : i'll move here
2 : umm
1 : i mean there isn't much else to do

3 : oh we're just waiting on the treasure cards
2 : oh!
3 : ooooo!
1 : ooo nice.
2 : this is good. no you guys should just go to like
1 : but
2 : the places

2 : ok
3 : yeah discard that fire that we have.
2 : alright yeah we're
2 : yeah
2 : so
3 : awesome.
1 : yay our little treasure
2 : basically yeah

2 : ok cool.
1 : ok yeah that wasn't that bad ok.
1 : pilot

2 : yeah
1 : yeah we're ok right now.
3 : good
3 : and waiting on
2 : ok
1 : treasure cards
2 : sounds good yeah
3 : yeah because we only need three so
