4 : ok
2 : alrighty
1 : so i'm the engineer, i must begin.
4 : yes
2 : mmhmm
2 : so you wanna
2 : do up to three of the actions
2 : you're on bronze gate
4 : mm
2 : mm
2 : do you wanna put your cards out so we know what we have and we can
1 : oh, sure.
4 : yeah
4 : oh
4 : that makes that easier
2 : cool,
2 : that's nice.
3 : ok
4 : alright
1 : so i have to make a move  one of this,
1 : one of these.
2 : mmhmm
3 : you can, yeah
4 : mm
1 : can i go over here?
2 : or you can
2 : nope, you can't move diagonally.
4 : no you can't
1 : oh diagonally. i can move over here but i'll be in, i'll be flooded.
4 : well you could
4 : right, you can move to a flooded one. and you could move over here but you'd have to take one action for this and then one action
2 : mmhmm
1 : wait, can i move to a flooded area?
4 : to there.
3 : yeah, and you could flip it if you want.
4 : yes you can.
1 : oh i can?
4 : yes.
3 : that counts as an action.
1 : i thought it was, i thought it was over.
4 : nah,
1 : oh
4 : as long as there's a tile there, you're fine.
1 : oh
4 : if the tile dissapears, then you're swimming.
2 : yeah
2 : so shoring up might be a good idea just so that we definitely have that path and it
1 : oh
2 : this doesn't get sunk, cause that's important.
4 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : so you could do
3 : you have three actions right, so you could do, like one, you could move here and then
3 : shore up
3 : and that would be two
3 : wait do we have three or four?
3 : no three
2 : yeah
1 : so once i move i gotta turn the card over?
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : well you don't have to but
2 : that would be two separate things.
3 : it would be wise.
4 : yeah
1 : do you care as to where i move to?
2 : nnhmm
2 : i mean, i think right now i would the best
3 : any of the, any of the flooded ones
1 : that's the one i was thinking about because temple,
1 : i feel like i need some religion
2 : yeah
2 : and
2 : these are valuable because
2 : you need to
2 : be on one of these in order to collect a treasure.
4 : right
3 : good point.
2 : so
2 : like
4 : mmhmm
2 : anything that has these icons, that have the treasure on them, like this,
2 : you'd have to be on this one to collect this treasure.
4 : right
4 : our most important ones are the ones with the icons and also
4 : anything around
2 : fool's landing
3 : yeah
4 : yes
4 : because then we always need a way to get back there. so these two are our most important
2 : right
2 : i think the
4 : two important ones to
2 : mmhmm
2 : mmhmm
4 : shore up.
2 : nice
2 : mm
1 : and i turn the card over?
2 : yeah, you wanna shore that one up
3 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
1 : and as i shore it up
1 : i still keep my piece on it?
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : and you have one more action
2 : right?
4 : so either can, you can either use one more action and shore that up, which you don't have to move to it
4 : or
4 : you can
4 : not
4 : do anything.
4 : it's up to you
4 : we don't have to do three things everytime.
1 : what would make you happy?
2 : eh
1 : what makes everybody else happy if i make a move
3 : i think it would be good to shore that one up
2 : me too, yeah.
4 : yes, i think
3 : since you have the ability to.
2 : and it's yeah, it's close to this.
3 : you don't have to
4 : you don't have to move.
3 : yeah
2 : you can shore up adjacent things
3 : cause that would take up a tu
4 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
2 : you can shore up like stuff that's next to you. yeah
4 : so either one of those, yeah
1 : ok
4 : cause that's fine because i can do diagonals
2 : mmhmm
4 : so
2 : cool, yeah.
3 : that's good
4 : ok
2 : alright
4 : and now it's two
3 : so, messenger
2 : now me.
4 : wait no, we have to do two treasure
2 : oh yeah.
2 : so you take two of these guys
2 : so
2 : we got that water's rise
2 : so with that
2 : we need to move this up one level
2 : hmm.
4 : and that gets discarded
2 : oh
2 : do we have to umm shuffle the flood discard pile and place it on top.
4 : yes
4 : we do.
2 : yeah, it's on the poster right behind. so
4 : yes
2 : i'll kinda just shuffle this up a little bit
4 : we need to flip that over this way.
2 : doo doo
2 : place it on top.
2 : cool, ok
4 : mmhmm
4 : and then we'll discard that
4 : card over onto that
2 : yeah
3 : and then you have to draw
4 : area.
3 : right?
3 : draw two
4 : thr
4 : yeah
4 : two
3 : water's rise
2 : uh, yeah two of these.
3 : so, temple of the moon and phantom rock. so temple of the moon is this one so you would
2 : ok
3 : flood that one and flood
4 : good thing you shored it up or it would've dissapeared.
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : and where's phantom's oh, here, i can do it.
4 : that one
4 : goes away.
3 : oh
3 : yeah.
3 : and then we take that card with it, right?
2 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
1 : is that a good thing, that they go away?
2 : nnhmm
3 : no
4 : no
2 : no, because that means
3 : but luckily that one's on the end
2 : yeah.
4 : cause the island is trying to kill us
4 : off.
3 : it's like a self destructing island.
2 : we're gonna drown.
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
4 : so it's us versus the island.
1 : ok
4 : so
2 : mmhmm
2 : ok
4 : alright, then that's the whole turn so now it's your turn.
3 : so
2 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : messenger
2 : umm
2 : let's see, what do i wanna do?
2 : i guess i'm gonna
2 : shore this up.
4 : mm
3 : you could
2 : mm
2 : maybe i should move?
3 : you could move to that one,
3 : shore it up and then shore that one.
2 : yeah
2 : yeah,
2 : good idea.
2 : so that's three things.
3 : yeah
2 : i think that's a good move.
2 : that's it, right?
3 : umm, and then don't you have to draw
2 : yeah
4 : yes
2 : yup
4 : then you have to draw two
3 : yup, draw two treasure cards
2 : ok
2 : so i got
2 : this
2 : and that.
3 : and then
4 : ok
2 : two of these.
3 : draw a flood card, yup.
4 : two flood
2 : two of them, right?
3 : yup
1 : the  that's in my hand can i put down, can i put it down?
2 : yeah, mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : oh, ok
2 : so
2 : cliffs of abandon,
2 : flooded again.
2 : and breaker's bridge, where is that?
2 : ok
2 : right
3 : then
2 : that's it right?
4 : that's it
3 : oh you don't have to do that cause you don't have a flood card.
2 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : so it's my turn.
2 : yup
3 : umm
2 : alright
3 : i am here
2 : so you're blue.
3 : ok
2 : cool.
3 : umm
2 : interesting
3 : if you want i could,
3 : i can fly anywhere, so i could go here,
3 : and i could get
3 : actually, i could go here
2 : yeah, i think that might be smart.
3 : and then i could get that one and that one.
2 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
3 : and flying does not count as an action
3 : no, it is an action.
2 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : but i think that's smart, cause we really don't wanna
2 : cause otherwise, like if those, like if this goes away, then we're gonna have to like go all the way around.
3 : actually, technically that's not 
4 : yeah
3 : it's just a move, but it doesn't matter
4 : mm
3 : umm
2 : oh yeah
3 : and then so
3 : these two.
2 : ok so that's three things
4 : k
2 : alright
2 : and
3 : and then i draw two of these
2 : mmhmm
3 : and
3 : two flood cards
2 : mmhmm
3 : got gold gate and lost lagoon,
2 : uh oh, so this is sunk
3 : k
2 : another one on the end, that's cool.
3 : lost lagoon
3 : that is also gone.
4 : that's go gone.
4 : mm
2 : they go fast
3 : and that's it
4 : they do
3 : ok.
2 : yeah
4 : that's it
4 : alright
2 : so
4 : well for one of my move, my first move
2 : let's see here.
4 : is going to be to give you
3 : smart
2 : thank you
4 : that card.
2 : so i have three now
4 : well
2 : and i only need one more
4 : and now there's nothing to be shored up.
4 : oh, wait, did i
4 : oh on the same oh.
2 : oh
4 : crap
4 : sorry.
2 : darn it
3 : there's only one person who can do that right? you can do that to anyone
4 : yeah, and that's you that can give
2 : i can give it to anybody, yeah.
4 : yes
3 : ok
4 : sorry
4 : ok, wait
2 : hmm, ok so where are you?
4 : wait
4 : yeah that's why i was trying to figure out where you are.
2 : here
4 : no i'm here.
2 : ok, you're green.
2 : i'm right here.
4 : so i can make two moves to get to you
4 : and then do that legally.
2 : oh yeah because
3 : you can move diagonally
4 : yes cause i can get one, two
3 : one, two
2 : ok
4 : and then my third move can be
3 : there we go
2 : sweet
4 : cause we're on the same tile.
3 : and i can get your two cards
4 : thank you
4 : i have
2 : cause she can move
4 : two of these
2 : diagonally so that's why that worked
4 : yes, i need two flood cards please.
2 : ok
4 : thank you
4 : alright, i have whispering gardens and iron gates.
2 : alright
4 : there you go
4 : now we're back,
4 : to your turn
2 : mmhmm
4 : engineer.
4 : mm
1 : hmm
1 : i can just move
2 : yup
2 : so
1 : mm
2 : let's see, does anybody you have this
3 : yes
2 : and you do too
4 : right, but we can't give em to him till we're
2 : ok
2 : right, yeah, no i know, i just
4 : so, yeah
2 : thinking
2 : umm
4 : really it doesn't
2 : so i mean
4 : at this point, it doesn't matter where you wanna move, or you could just not move at all
4 : because
3 : he could do
2 : he could try to get close to that.
4 : actually if he
4 : doesn't move
4 : at all on this turn
4 : you're first thing on your first turn
3 : could be to give him card
4 : to give him a card.
4 : my first turn is to give him a card then his next turn then he can move
3 : that's a good idea
4 : one, two, and three.
2 : but what if he
2 : would it help if he got close to that now?
4 : then we'd have to move where ever he moves.
2 : oh wait, oh is it give him a card? yup, never mind, never mind. ok, smart
3 : to give him a
4 : yeah then to  a card
4 : so i mean, that's
2 : uh ok
4 : yeah
3 : so
4 : so i think that would be best, is to actually not move at all
1 : huh
4 : for you.
1 : i'll go along with the consensus, i won't move.
4 : ok.
3 : ok
2 : cool
3 : and so then you'd still need to draw. here's the two
3 : treasure cards.
3 : he might even get
3 : 
1 : water rise ca card.
3 : flood
1 : is that
1 : that's a bad thing?
4 : yup
2 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : uh yeah, so move that up one more.
1 : oh
2 : so
2 : yup, that needs to go up here.
1 : oh wow
4 : then we needa
4 : shuffle those cards too and put em up top.
4 : so
4 : and then the
4 : water rises card
4 : you'll discard
2 : so that goes back over here
4 : right back over there.
1 : thank you
2 : mmhmm
4 : and then that one just goes into your hand.
2 : yup, so that's yours, and you can just stick it right here.
4 : now we need three flood cards
2 : yeah
2 : so
4 : i'm sorry i feel like i'm being bossy.
2 : no you're it's
2 : it's good, you're keeping it rolling.
1 : you're the only one who has the knowledge
4 : sorry
1 : so i gotta rely on uh
4 : mmhmm
2 : so these you just need to flood whatever
2 : location is like
1 : temple moon
2 : temple moon,
4 : no that's where we all are.
2 : oh no!
1 : that was a bad thing?
4 : hmm
2 : not really, we can just
3 : i can probably save it on my turn. someone
2 : shore it up.
4 : yes.
1 : so what
1 : i get this card?
2 : uh
3 : umm
4 : goes
4 : to discard over there.
2 : this goes back over here, yup.
1 : ok
2 : discard pile.
1 : breaker bridge,
2 : mmhmm, so that gets flooded too.
2 : mmhmm
1 : and cliffs of abandon
2 : also right here
2 : alright
2 : so that goes over here.
2 : alright
2 : so
3 : do we need to shuffle those
3 : and put them on top or that's only when you get a flood card, ok
4 : no
2 : nope
2 : we already did that, yeah
2 : alright so i should
2 : probably try to move towards whispering
2 : no, because
2 : i need to be never mind
2 : nobody has this card.
2 : umm
2 : what should i do?
2 : i'm just gonna yeah, shore up
3 : you could try to shore up some, yeah
2 : so, i'm gonna shore up this
2 : and this
2 : and this
3 : perfect.
4 : there you go.
2 : alright
3 : ok
2 : and
2 : yes!
2 : check it out!
3 : awesome
2 : ok
3 : so hopefully you can get to that
2 : and then
4 : and you can only have
4 : five
2 : huh, oh
4 : cards in your hand.
4 : i saw her move and i realized that's what our problem was.
2 : ok
2 : one, two, three.
2 : so i should get rid of
2 : i can get rid of two, right?
3 : yeah
2 : and they just go here?
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok
3 : and then
2 : three of these
2 : alright, temple of the sun,
2 : whispering gardens, oh no!
4 : is gone.
3 : ugh
3 : no
2 : and iron
4 : oh i need that
2 : oh
4 : the whispering gardens
2 : yeah
2 : iron gate,
2 : also gone.
2 : that's not cool
2 : yeah
4 : oh and
2 : sorry
4 : also
4 : it's ok
3 : ok, and that's it?
2 : yup
4 : yup
3 : ok
3 : so i am
3 : where am i? i'm blue.
4 : you should give him, wait
4 : oh yeah, you are
3 : we're not on the same card, so i'll move to him
4 : that's right, ok, sorry
3 : umm, that's one action.
2 : mmhmm
3 : i could do that cause i have the helicopter.
4 : right
3 : and then
3 : here's the one of those
4 : well i have one, two
3 : and
4 : three, four, that's a fifth card, so, ok, we're good on that.
3 : ok
3 : so that was two actions and i can do one more
4 : mmhmm
3 : there's really nothing i can do right now, right?
2 : umm
3 : cause i can't shore up
3 : all i can do is move.
3 : is there somewhere that you guys think i should move?
2 : you
2 : what if you move
2 : can you move
3 : i could move to here
2 : somebody else?
3 : umm
2 : wait,
3 : no.
2 : i mean just with these, but we might wanna save this.
2 : i'm just thinking about how can i get to here
3 : i could, i could probably just move you, i have two cards.
3 : move one or more pawns on the same tile, and you are on the same tile
3 : so
3 : i think we could do that.
2 : should we do that?
3 : yeah
4 : yes
3 : so you're
2 : yup
3 : gray
2 : and that's just, and then that needs to go here.
4 : mmhmm
3 : ok, and then i get two of these.
2 : so i'm all set to
2 : grab that then.
3 : and can you grab me three?
2 : mmhmm
3 : those
3 : tidal palace,
3 : copper gate,
4 : it feels like the holding of the breath to see which one's going.
3 : and the crimson
3 : forest. where's the crimson oh, i got it.
4 : oh
4 : here.
3 : and that's good.
4 : ok
2 : so we should definitely unshore those because
2 : that's, yeah
3 : like we need to get like those two
2 : this is our last one of the,
2 : the
2 : oh, never mind.
2 : what am i thinking?
3 : and we need these, for sure.
2 : yeah, yeah
4 : yeah
4 : so alright, my first move is to give you
4 : this
3 : yay
4 : and you'll need to discard either this one or the
4 : rock formation
4 : one.
4 : either one
3 : probably the fire
4 : act
3 : yeah
4 : yeah the fire one would probably be the best one to
3 : cause you do have two of those
3 : if we wanted to do that.
4 : yeah
4 : ok
4 : so that's done for that.
4 : umm
4 : let me see. so that's one action.
2 : mmhmm.
2 : wait he has these but he needs to get
2 : here
2 : or here.
4 : right
2 : umm
3 : i think your best bet might be to move
4 : this is what i was thinking
4 : and then
4 : was to move
4 : diagonal here, cause i did one, that's two
4 : and then
4 : umm
4 : i can shore up
2 : yeah
4 : this card.
3 : ok
1 : that's you?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : i mean other than that, that's about all i can really do
2 : i think that's good, that's this is very important.
4 : at this point,
4 : so.
4 : that's my second move, this is my third
4 : move, so
3 : ok
4 : alright
4 : may i have two cards please?
3 : and
2 : oh sorry
2 : uh oh
4 : oh, the water rises again,
2 : i can do that for you
4 : which means we get to shuffle all this again too.
4 : and that goes
4 : discarded.
1 : so
1 : if we get up here and the water rises then that,
1 : that means we lose?
4 : yes
3 : yeah, if it gets to the skull and crossbones.
2 : mmhmm
2 : the death,
2 : yeah
1 : oh
2 : so
4 : i need three
2 : yeah
4 : flooded.
2 : so it
3 : uh oh
2 : it's
2 : also, we can note that like, these are gonna be ones that have recently flooded.
3 : yeah
4 : right
4 : when i
1 : can the water level ever go down?
3 : no
1 : no?
2 : nnhmm
4 : it won't go down, no. it'll only go up.
4 : ok
3 : at least we didn't lose any.
4 : no
4 : that's the yeah, that's the best part.
4 : we lost nothing, at least.
4 : that's the end of my turn.
2 : yeah
1 : now i gotta move.
2 : cool
2 : mmhmm
3 : you could shore up or wait no, he needs to get to
2 : oh yeah
4 : he needs to get to a cup
3 : one, two, three
2 : yeah
2 : but then, that's an action
2 : taking it.
3 : oh
4 : oh
3 : i mean he could at least just get there
3 : and then on his next turn
2 : yeah
2 : that's fine.
4 : yeah
2 : i can't think of any alternate
3 : yeah, so
2 : cause you should probably save that. yeah
3 : just go to this one, and then on your next turn you can turn em in to get the,
3 : that thing.
2 : sound good?
2 : does that make sense?
1 : it's alright with me.
2 : cool
3 : ok
3 : and then
3 : here's the two treasure cards
1 : wow, look at all the cards
3 : we have to
1 : helicopter lift
3 : uh oh
4 : one, two, three, four, five, yeah
2 : oh
3 : uh oh
4 : oh
2 : oh no
4 : well no you can always discard what you just got
4 : it just says you have to discard
3 : i think you can do that, it doesn't say you can't.
4 : nnhmm
1 : didn't it say i shouldn't have no more than five cards?
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : so that's what we're saying, you should probably discard the ones that you just got, cause these are important.
2 : what's this?
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : the only thing is like are we ever gonna be able to get this like
2 : yeah, ok and there's more than one of these. ok
4 : well, yeah
3 : we're good
4 : yeah so we're still good on that.
2 : there's more than four in the whole deck, ok
3 : umm
3 : is it all oh, flood cards.
2 : and then
2 : flood cards, so three of these.
2 : there you go
1 : breaker's bridge
3 : that's that one
1 : tidal
1 : tidal palace
3 : oh
4 : nope, that's out.
2 : oh no
3 : then can we have that card  this card
4 : good
1 : tidal palace, breaker's bridge
3 : umm, we don't need to do wait, yeah
2 : breaker's bridge is ok so that can go in here.
4 : good thing you moved in the direction you moved
3 : yeah
4 : because that would've been a waste of moves,
2 : yeah
4 : if we would've gone the other direction
4 : though.
1 : god made me do that.
4 : yes
1 : temple of the sun
3 : oo
4 : yup
3 : ok
2 : ok, so this we definitely need to
2 : shore up.
4 : ok
3 : yeah, i can shore that up
3 : on my turn.
3 : cause i'm on it
2 : alright, so i'm gonna take this treasure
4 : mmhmm
2 : do i need to like put these somewhere?
3 : uh
4 : i believe you discard them.
4 : umm
2 : capture treasure, if you discard four matching treasure cards to the treasure discard pile.
3 : mm
4 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : so that was one action, right?
2 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
3 : umm
2 : and
2 : what else can i do?
3 : probably just move
3 : towards the center more in case, so you can get to
2 : yeah
