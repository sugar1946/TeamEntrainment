1 : ok.
1 : so
1 : i'll shore up these two
1 : then move here.
1 : and shore up these two.
1 : and can you pass me
1 : the treasure cards
1 : thanks
1 : and water's rise already.
2 : i can shuffle these if you want
3 : do you have to draw the
3 : flood cards first or
4 : no i think that's after
3 : wait
2 : you have to, you have to do water rise immediately
3 : ok
3 : oh water ok
2 : ok
2 : i'll leave it like that
1 : and phantom rock and cliffs of abandon
1 : ah and phantom rock's gone
3 : oh
4 : no here
1 : thanks
2 : alright umm
2 : we're going to
2 : is this adjacent to me?
4 : yeah
2 : ok i'm going to
4 : right? what's your no yeah
4 : you're red
2 : cause i'm right here ok
1 : i'm red
4 : oh no it's not adjacent, i'm sorry you're gray, so no, it's not.
2 : no no i'm gray
2 : so not even ok, umm then i'm going to
4 : but i could
2 : umm
4 : but you can move and make it adjacent to you
2 : yeah so that'll be one
2 : action, this is two actions then
4 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : and then
2 : give
2 : umm
1 : you could give
4 : yeah give him that or give me that
2 : that
4 : the lion thing
2 : this one, yeah i'm trying to decide, umm, which one do you think?
4 : it doesn't
4 : it doesn't matter but either way
3 : maybe whoever's closer to it?
2 : you're closer to
1 : probably i would give her, i would give her the lion because she's
2 : because you're closer to, yeah ok, that makes sense
4 : i'm right there? ok yeah that makes sense
2 : alright yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : umm and then take two of these
2 : and then i have to draw two
2 : oh
4 : oh so that one's gone
2 : it's gone
1 : mm
2 : and
1 : the one i'm on is
1 : flooded
2 : yeah, sorry
3 : ok
3 : oh yeah, blue
3 : so
3 : see i have a purple one
3 : so i guess i could move
1 : you can fly to me and give it to me if you want.
3 : to
4 : oh yeah that's a good idea.
1 : although actually
3 : give it to you
1 : i don't have any of the purple right now
4 : or you can fly to
4 : oh no but that doesn't make sense
3 :  to the purple
4 : yeah you can fly to me and give it to me
4 : cause i have the purple one
3 : you're green
2 : should we maybe fly him off the flooded one?
3 : yeah but you're not closer to the purple
4 : yeah that makes sense
3 : like the purple one is here
3 : and
3 : next to him, i guess you could like work on getting the
1 : yeah we could meet on the space and trade
3 : the
3 : gold the lion
4 : ok
1 : it wouldn't take too many turns
4 : ok
3 : maybe i'll just move
3 : to the
3 : try
2 : i'm just scared that this is gonna get flooded
1 : i'm gonna
2 : or i guess it doesn't matter cause then you'll be able to go anywhere but
3 : oh
3 : i can
4 : oh no, that's that's good though she should
4 : definitely fix that one
3 : oh so fly there and then fix that one
4 : yeah
3 : ok so that's one
3 : two
3 : and then
3 : i don't
3 : think i'd want to do anything else
3 :  i just stick with two moves?
4 : yeah you don't have to, you can stop
2 : mm.
3 : ok i'll just stick with the two then
3 : and i'll draw two more
3 : ok and then two flood cards
2 : lost lagoon and breaking bbridge
4 : that one
3 : that's next, right next to it
2 : where's the other one? oh yeah
1 : oop
1 : there we go
3 : ok
4 : ok
4 : so i could move here and then fix that one.
2 : oh cause you can move diagonally right?
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
4 : so that's one move
2 : wait does
4 : what
1 : i don't know if there's
2 : is that adjacent?
1 : take backs in this game
4 : why?
1 : what no she can move diagonally that doesn't matter
2 : oh is that does that mean that you're adjacent to this now?
4 : yeah
2 : ok got it
1 : well adjacent is just if you're directly on it. but she's the explorer so her special thing is she can do
4 : well
3 : yeah
4 : so i can do it, anything diagonally
2 : she can kind of do anything got it
1 : in a square
4 : ok so that's my first move
4 : then this moving, fixing this will be my second move?
2 : mmhmm.
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok
4 : and then what else should i do?
4 : should i give
4 : this
1 : i would say
4 : oh no we're not on the same tile
1 : i think it might let's see
1 : if you move here, you're pretty close to three separate treasures
4 : mmhmm.
4 : yeah that's a good idea
1 : so that's what i think
2 : might as well yeah
3 : hmm. yeah.
4 : ok so i'll do that.
1 : cause then like you can make progress towards trying to get this, the statue
4 : there
4 : mmhmm.
4 : yeah
1 : or whatever
4 : and i can collect the statue by myself, oh yeah i would have to cause it's
1 : yeah you can
1 : but yeah
4 : i just have those two
4 : ok.
4 : so there and that, three, four, five.
4 : and then can i have
4 : two of those
2 : two oh sorry
4 : thanks
4 : oh ok, whispering gardens
2 : whispering garden
4 : and iron gate
4 : thank you
1 : hmm
1 : ok so i'm gonna
1 : what i think i want to try to do is get the chalice.
1 : so four of them are already on there, so i can definitely do that.
1 : so
1 : who's
1 : blue?
3 : ok
4 : mm
3 : i'm blue
1 : you're blue
1 : ok let me
1 : shh
1 : i'll trade you
1 : the oh wait
1 : let me look at this real quick
3 : can you trade? wait
4 : yeah i don't think you can trade, you can just give it to her.
1 : yeah that's right, so
2 : mm.
1 : i'm not gonna bother doing that
1 : ok so i'm gonna move
1 : here
1 : shore that up
2 : mmhmm.
1 : 
1 : and that's all for now.
1 : water's rise
2 : oh
2 : you got luck
1 : so now we're at three
4 : oh no
4 : we can't lose that guy
1 : yeah
4 : that would stink
1 : well we can but
1 : it'd be better not to.
3 : hmm
2 : and i guess because this is getting discarded
2 : you don't have to discard another one right? cause you're past five?
1 : two four well i
1 : have five
4 : no that doesn't count
1 : but the you're right that's getting discarded anyway
2 : ok
1 : but even so
2 : just to clarify
1 : like even if weren't i only have five so
2 : yeah
3 : mm oh
4 : i don't think, i don't think your card counts as
1 : it does, yeah it does not
4 : ok
1 : oh look what we just
4 : no
2 : that's gone
3 : mhhf
4 : ok i knew that was gonna happen
1 : oh should've, we should have used the sandbag i didn't even think of it
2 : oh
1 : oh well
2 : we're learning umm
2 : i
4 : you should give me your lion right?
2 : but i can't cause you have five already and i don't want to get rid of
4 : oh no
4 : yeah that make yeah i get you
2 : umm i could use a sandbag if we're
2 : thinking that we need
2 : one, do i have to
3 : you can use that an any
2 : do i have to be near it?
3 : time.
4 : oh yeah can you use that at any time?
1 : no it's anywhere. it's any of the tiles
2 : oh ok
1 : but neither of those are like important
2 : umm
4 : yeah so don't use it yet
1 : i wouldn't, yeah i'd save it
2 : oh true, true, ok
3 : yeah and they're on the edge of the game, too
4 : wait until this guy
4 : goes away cause
4 : if we lose him then we lose
1 : yeah
1 : well
2 : so do i want to do anything actually?
1 : yeah
3 : well i don't think we, well cause we only need three out of the four treasures.
1 : yeah we don't lose automatically, but it will make it way harder to win
4 : oh yeah that's true too
3 : yeah
1 : well let's see so you have lion and
1 : crystal
2 : the one that just went away, what was the one that went on there? it was a lion? ok
3 : it was lion.
4 : it was the lion
1 : umm i'd say move like
1 : here, just so we're all, like we should probably try to be fairly spread out i think so we can
2 : so move two, you think?
1 : just or somewhere, yeah
2 : i'll move two cause i have a red already so, it kind of makes sense i guess to me
1 : yeah sure.
2 : umm and then i'll just
2 : do this
2 : oh yay another sandbag
4 : oh and there's the lion
2 : nice!
2 : ok this doesn't count right? that's 
4 : ok well that's good
4 : yeah
4 : don't forget you have to take three
3 : yeah i have three
2 : oh we're
2 : oh that's
1 : it moved up to three
2 : three i see
2 : temple of the moon ok that one, ok cliffs of abandon
4 : it's right next to it
2 : oh there, oh no, iron iron gate
1 : and iron gate
4 : so we lost him
3 : that's this one
1 : ok well it doesn't matter
2 : oh, ok
4 : but that that's ok, wait can i have the card?
2 : oh
2 : mm, yeah
2 : sorry
4 : thanks
4 : it's alright
3 : ok so i'm on
3 : temple of the moon
4 : so we should fix that
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : definitely
3 : and then
4 : so that's one
1 : and so what i think would wo
3 : i can
1 : be a good idea is fly to me and give me the
1 : umm chalice
1 : because i'm trying to get that. and then that'll give me three out of the four
3 : where are you ok
2 : oh that'll give you one step closer
4 : mmhmm.
3 : ok
1 : and then the explorer can, yeah
4 : and i can just give it to you
2 : awesome yeah that'll be the next turn
3 : ok alright
1 : and then hop right back, if you want to stay on that tile
4 : yeah
3 : should i fix
3 : cities of abandon before i fly
3 : oh no wait
1 : you can't give me the tile if you do that
3 : oh no i would have to fly and then give you the tile ok
3 : gotcha
4 : so fly to you
1 : thanks
4 : that's three ok
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok so i have the lion and then the
3 : the crystal
3 : move to temple of the sun, which is this one.
2 : mmhmm.
3 : crimson forest
3 : and breaker's bridge
2 : i'm horrible at finding these
1 : ok
3 : they're hard
4 : i know
4 : it's like upside down too
4 : ok so
2 : alright
4 : i should come to you right?
1 : mmhmm. and give me the
4 : and give you that
1 : other chalice which means i'm gonna have to
1 : discard one of these
2 : oohhh
4 : oh i didn't think about that
4 : but
1 : but then we'll definitely but then i'll definitely get
4 : i didn't realize that there were more
4 : yeah yeah
1 : the chalice next turn unless
1 : yeah i will definitely get it so
4 : ok so i'd have to do two moves so
3 : maybe i could
1 : oh you're
3 : should i heli
4 : oh that's not me
3 : ah should i helicopter lift you? oh
1 : yeah you're right there
4 : i'm right here
1 : no she's right there
3 : oh never mind
4 : whew i got nervous
4 : ok one
4 : and then give you that
1 : two so which one do you guys think i should
4 : that's two
3 : i think you should discard the
3 : crystal
1 : this? the red one?
2 : the purple?
3 : well actually i don't know
1 : well let's see here
2 : i have one
3 : that we have three of each umm currently
1 : yeah
4 : yeah it doesn't
4 : totally mat oh no well we have four, yeah
1 : uh i'll discard this because i'll
2 : no we have four, we have
3 : oh we do have four, ok
4 : we have four, yeah get rid of that one.
2 : we have four so get rid of the red one yeah.
1 : yeah definitely
1 : uh over there
2 : op sorry
4 : ok so that was one move for me
1 : it's ok
4 : umm
1 : one move and then you traded so that's two actions
2 : oh two so two
4 : oh so two moves
3 : then you
4 : and then
1 : so you can go right back if you want or you can fix
2 : maybe just
4 : yeah let's fix this guy
2 : fix one.
4 : cause that would, if we lose that, that would be a bridge between a bunch of them
1 : mm.
2 : mm.
4 : ok
4 : can i have two
4 : of those cards?
2 : mmhmm
4 : ugh
2 : not water's rise oh!
4 : yeah i did
3 : mm
4 : ok so
4 : move it up
4 : and then i have to take three still
2 : mm
1 : mm
4 : ok temple of the moon
2 : mmhmm
4 : cliffs of abandon
2 : oh
3 : mm
4 : and breakers bridge
1 : shoot
2 : that's such a cheery name
1 : ok
2 : yeah
3 : cliff of abandon
4 : ok
1 : hmm
4 : so you should definitnely go get that guy
1 : yeah
1 : so one
4 : one
3 : and then you get the treasure
4 : and discard is two
2 : do we
1 : two
2 : oh discarding is two
2 : discarding and getting it is
1 : i get this
2 : two you think?
3 : no i think she's saying like that's the second action
4 : no
4 : yeah that's like the the second move
1 : this is the second action
2 : oh got it ok yeah
3 : yeah
1 : and
1 : i can't
1 : fix anything from here
1 : so i'm gonna go
2 : mm
1 : i'm gonna go here.
3 : ooo
1 : oh no
3 : i realize ok so we have
3 : two
1 : shoot
3 : of the
1 : crystals?
3 : earth
4 : oh yeah you should fix that before
3 : the earth ones that are
3 : flooded
1 : i can't though
2 : but you can't
3 : yeah but
1 : you could with the sandbags
2 : i will for sure
1 : oh yeah
3 : cause he has to draw three but
1 : i would do that now, yeah cause i have to draw three at the end of this turn
3 : yeah
2 : so should i just go?
1 : well you can do those when it's not your turn
4 : you can do it at any time?
2 : oh
1 : the sandbags
2 : oh shoot yeah i forgot about that. umm
3 : yeah
1 : so action discard
2 : so can i just
4 : yeah so put that there
2 : from any point
1 : yeah and it doesn't count as an action
2 : i don't have to be anywhere near it. so do this one we're saying?
1 : yeah
1 : and then do the other one
3 : oh use both?
2 : use both of them
1 : i mean if we lose those that's gonna make it
1 : pretty difficult
2 : true
3 : oh yeah
1 : is what i'm thinking
2 : so do this
1 : i mean if you guys think we should save it
3 : i don't know
1 : what do you think, it's your card
2 : i don't know 
4 : it's
2 : i, i think it's
4 : it's like a matter of luck
3 : how many do we have of those?
2 : we only
1 : well she had two and that's it
2 : mm, so should we save it for fool's landing?
3 : i mean like total in deck
1 : oh i don't know
4 : oh yeah that's actually wise
2 : because then you might be able to fly over and save it if you
4 : yeah that's true
2 : so maybe save it
3 : ok yeah
4 : yeah so keep it
2 : ok
4 : ok so you still have to do your third action
2 : so your
3 : ooo
4 : or you don't have to
1 : or yeah
1 : i don't. i might not. i can't really think of anything useful.
2 : ok
3 : mm i don't know maybe move to the crystal? i don't know
1 : cause i need to
2 : just stick with that.
3 : cause since there's no use for coral palace anymore
1 : mmhmm, except as a bridge
3 : other than it being a br yeah
1 : that's too bad i can't give this to you or trade it
3 : i feel like you
2 : you could s go to cave of shadows and then if breaker's is still there grab it on the next turn
1 : yeah
4 : that's true
2 : and then you'd be that one closer to the
4 : ok
1 : yeah that's true, it's unlikley but we'll hope
2 : ok
2 : umm
4 : ok so pick your two treasure cards
2 : oh yeah
1 : so i got a lift ooh and another crystal
2 : oh nice ok.
4 : oh that's good.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : lost lagoon
1 : gone
2 : hmm it was already lost
1 : temple of the sun, gone.
3 : man
3 : this happens what
3 : ah the wrong one
2 : oh
4 : oh
1 : crimson forest, oh gone well that one didn't matter
3 : ah
4 : gone
3 : ok
2 : ok so lesson learned use the sandbag's umm alright
4 : you should probably give me
2 : yeah
4 : your lions
4 : right?
2 : do you want to get rid of what you already have though?
4 : because then
4 : well i can get rid of this guy
1 : yeah cause we already have the chalice
2 : oh true
4 : and then she and i are on the same thing and then she can give me hers.
2 : so i'll give you one lion
4 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : so i can get rid of the chalice.
2 : umm wait can i give multiple card as my one action?
1 : you no one action is giving one card, but you can you have three total actions so
3 : ah
2 : it says treasure cards
4 : you can yeah you can give it to anyone.
4 : ok so you just used one action.
2 : ok so that's not part of my special umm.
4 : so where are you?
2 : maybe i move closer to or i'm already on the red and i'm not gonna get the lions
2 : umm i don't think i can really do anything else at this point that's useful
4 : yeah you might just want to stop.
2 : yeah
4 : also
4 : we don't want to run out of the time.
2 : yeah
2 : select these oh great i have two more reds.
4 : oh good
2 : awesome
3 : ok
3 : mm
2 : mm
2 : let's see tidal palace
2 : silver gate
2 : mmhmm and copper gate
4 : this one
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : so i would need to give you a lion. are you text to a lion?
3 : you can get
4 : we're around the same thing right? cause you're blue?
3 : ok
4 : yeah so you should give me
3 : but you could get to the lion on the next turn
4 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
4 : ok you should give me that.
3 : oh but you have to discard something
2 : but then you have to
4 : but that's ok cause he's got two.
4 : and you've got one and i've got one.
1 : yeah well that'll work out.
2 : true
3 : ok so we have three. ok so i'll give you that
3 : for one.
3 : move.
3 : and then
2 : and the save one i'd say.
4 : yeah i was gonna say fix that one.
3 : should i give you something?
3 : if you have three
1 : umm
3 : should i give you one of the purple?
2 : cause he's kind of near there if we saved this you could get to it
4 : i would, i would fix this
4 : because then, cause he can't he can't even get to it unless you save it
2 : yeah actually cause that's the bridge cause then he won't be able
1 : yeah i'd say fix that.
3 : ah ok.
2 : that's more important
2 : that's your second action?
4 : ok
3 : ok mmhmm.
4 : yeah so that's your second action
1 : and that's two
1 : and now
3 : cause if i draw two cards i have to discard one of them
1 : you can just move.
1 : oh you're right.
3 : because i'd have six.
1 : yeah
3 : so maybe i should give you this?
4 : yeah actually that's a good idea
1 : you can't though. you're already passed that point.
4 : oh no but you can't yeah cause you're on the same
3 : oh i'm not
3 : i keep on forgetting who's
3 : ok you're green
3 : oh well so you don't really need that ok so then
3 : well
1 : yeah i forgot you had those two helicopter lifts
3 : just
3 : yeah should i just
3 : well should i use the heli
4 : what do the helicopter lifts do?
1 : you can move anyone anywhere.
3 : yeah i can move anyone to anything.
2 : do we want to move him closer to where purple?
2 : the engineer or yeah the engineer closer to where purple is?
3 : i don't know do want me to move you on to purple?
3 : i don't know
1 : umm yeah that's actually a pretty decent.
4 : actually that's not a bad idea
4 : that's actually a good idea. that's what i would do
3 : move you to purple? i could do that any time.
3 : but
3 : if you want to do that now
2 : oh maybe
2 : save it
4 : yeah do it now before you
4 : draw your cards
3 : ok
4 : and then you can keep those cards
3 : or should i draw the cards before and then see what
3 : the cards say?
4 : ah that's true
1 : yeah actually do that because when you discard an action card you have to like use it at the same time, so that yeah that's a really great idea
2 : oh that's true. ok do that, yeah, yeah.
3 : and then
4 : actually yeah that's true do that
3 : can i do that?
3 : wait when you discard you have to use it?
1 : like if you discard the helicopter lift, you don't just like throw it away, you use it and throw it away
3 : oh
1 : so yeah definitely, draw two
3 : ok
3 : so then
1 : let's see where what it is
3 : so i got two
2 : oh you got a lion ok
3 : things
2 : ok
4 : so now you're at s
3 : we don't need this purple because
3 : we already have enough
3 : on
3 : or
3 : yeah we have enough
4 : we don't need the lion
3 : oh we do have a lot of lion ok
1 : and she already has all four lions so get rid of that.
3 : ah ok so then let's get rid of the lion
2 : and i have one lion so i can give that to her
4 : yeah
4 : so get rid of that
1 : yeah there you go and you can save your helicopter lift
3 : ok
1 : or if you want use it
3 : alright
3 : so bronze gate which i think we just fly
2 : mm
3 : oh no there's a lot of gates. ok cave of shadows
3 : and
3 : dunes of deception
2 : oh ok.
3 : it's ok i can we can fly ourselves off of it i can i can fly you myself
4 : bummer
4 : ok my turn
4 : so i should probably fix that one.
1 : umm
4 : and then go to that one.
3 : no cause you cause you have to use
3 : you need three moves like you have to
3 : get
3 : you have
4 : oh you're right, you're right ok.
3 : you have to travel twice to get there and then discard
1 : yeah get the treasure cause i'll fix these on my turn so
4 : so i'll go
4 : ok
4 : so i'll go here
4 : and then this is two
4 : and then i get this guy
4 : and
1 : that's actually only two actions so
3 : no that was three cause she had to
3 : umm move
1 : she can go diagonal
3 : two
3 : oh you went diagonally
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : oh i didn't know you went diagonally
3 : i forgot you could do that
4 : and then
4 : oh i wish i could give this to you
2 : so didn't we save you?
3 : yeah so then you can save that tile again.
2 : we could save that?
4 : oh yeah then i could do that, that's a good idea
2 : cause you can save diagonally as well?
1 : might as well yeah.
3 : yeah
4 : cause i can save diagonally
4 : ok cool then can i have two of those?
3 : oh man
2 : ok
2 : i keep forgetting you can do that. it's so cool.
3 : i know i forget she can go diagonally.
2 : jealous of your talents.
4 : and then three
2 : alright
3 : oh man
4 : i know i'm worried.
3 : i know
4 : cave of embers
3 : that doesn't sound familiar so that's good.
2 : yeah
4 : howling garden
2 : ok
4 : and misty marsh
1 : ok so we already have the lion, so i don't care if that sinks
2 : ok so i'll
3 : it's not bad
3 : ok
4 : yeah
1 : we already have the chalice so i don't care if that sinks or that, although that would suck cause that's a bridge.
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : yeah so let's try to save that one
3 : yeah
3 : so you need the one that she's on?
3 : the one that messenger
3 : yeah the messenger's on and then
3 : the
3 : the one that you're on
1 : mmhmm
1 : umm
2 : i just realized we should have given
2 : oh no nevermmind
4 : but i couldn't cause we weren't on the same thing
2 : yeah that's true. i keep for, i keep remembering that that's my talent and then i was like never mind
4 : i know it's so confusing
1 : ok so i need to get here.
4 : you're the red one? you should save this one and then go up, up.
1 : yeah
3 : do you
1 : that's what i was thinking
1 : yeah cause it doesn't matter if we lose that.
4 : yeah
3 : do you want ok, yeah i mean you can do that but i could fly you there if you, oh you have a helicopter-ok so we have three helicopter lifts
1 : so
4 : definitely
1 : save that up
4 : save that one
1 : mmhmm.
2 : that's one, two, three
1 : two, three i don't have a heli oh i do, ok never mind
3 : yeah
1 : well that's good cause we need at least one to get off so
3 : yeah ok
3 : and we have we all have to make it to fool's landing right?
1 : so i have these two
1 : no, you don't have any, that's unfortunate.
2 : yeah
4 : you should use your helicopter lift to go to him and then give him those.
1 : with your remaining actions, yeah that's a good idea.
4 : yeah
3 : ooo ok
1 : cause then i can have
1 : i can helicopter lift both of us back here.
4 : and then on your turn.
4 : yeah
1 : and then everybody else just has to
1 : make it
3 : ok and then should we just wait for her to collect the cave of
4 : yeah
1 : no cause i'll we'll have three. you need three of the four so
3 : embers
4 : no cause we only need three
3 : oh right, right right. ok so
4 : ok.
1 : yeah that sounds like a good plan. oh thanks yeah
3 : ok should i should i go there now?
4 : so then go?
2 : you're welcome.
1 : oh, and we already have three
4 : and then your flood cards.
1 : two, three, yeah
2 : oh i keep
2 : forgetting that that card doesn't get
1 : what am i losing, coral palace
1 : observatory, over there and watchtower
4 : good
2 : awesome ok
3 : the water rise's card
4 : ok cool
2 : i'm gonna save this one. umm should i move this way or this way? we already have the cup
3 : oh man
4 : yeah good call
1 : try to get towards fool's landing cause if this goes the way we're planning, i'll get this like in the next turn
4 : mmhmm.
3 : mm.
1 : and we all need to be on here to win so
2 : we already have the lion so i don't care about
3 : yeah
2 : giving that away so i'm just gonna move in a straight path then
1 : yeah sure
4 : no but you can't do two at the same time, so this is your first action
2 : oh i can't
2 : and then moving is my second and then
4 : so then
4 : move, move second
4 : third right?
1 : yeah
1 : right, you're right
2 : so i shouldn't save this one you think?
1 : no there's no point
4 : no cause we don't, we don't need it
2 : oh
1 : well i already have the chalice
3 : oh yeah and if we're none of us are in that area then it's ok if it leaves
2 : and all of us have a path to here. ok good. alright, got it. alright
4 : yeah, yeah yeah.
2 : oh awesome, so i got my own red but then i'll give away this.
1 : yeah
2 : umm yeah.
4 : just in case yeah
1 : and
1 : so i think we have to shuffle now
1 : and continue drawing because this ran out
1 : oh
4 : you may only have five cards in your hand
1 : that too
4 : oh so you have to get rid of one of those. get rid of the chalice
2 : oh oh, oh yeah
1 : yeah
3 : oh you do have ok.
2 : oof i didn't even count the sandbag
1 : so
2 : so we shuffle all of them?
1 :  
1 : i don't remember what it said. i think so though
3 : mmhmm
3 : water rise's cards
2 : 
3 : umm
2 : umm
3 : if
3 : you draw a
1 : immediately shuffle and stack the cards to draw yup
2 : so shuffle all of them you think?
4 : ok yes
4 : no, no no just those ones
1 : just these, just just these, yep. that i already yeah.
2 : so save, these are the two that i already have
4 : so save the ones that are in your hands
4 : yeah
2 : i'll just do these while you do that
1 : ok sure
3 : oo yeah flood card
2 : so fool's landing is a priority to save i think
4 : yeah
1 : mmhmm, yeah cause we lose if it sinks
4 : you should use your sandbag now to save it.
1 : well no, cause there's only one of each, so it's not gonna sink
4 : oh ok
4 : and the observatory
1 : observatory which is
2 : observatory
2 : is
2 : gone so i move to here.
1 : well perfect. that's where you're goin anyway.
4 : yeah good idea.
3 : ooo fools landing is flooded?
2 : oop
3 : ok but it just got flooded.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
3 : ok so i'm
3 : let's see what
3 : what was i gonna do?
1 : oh actually yeah if she gets what you're right yeah, i keep forgetting
4 : but careful, cause if she draws water's rise they do that, so i would use a sandbag to save that right now.
1 : definitely
2 : right now or what am i thinking
4 : no that goes there and then that's saved
2 : k, got it
4 : ok cool. phew
1 : right good point.
2 : nice
1 : cause that's definitely what's gonna happen
3 : mmhmm
4 : ok so then you were gonna use your helicopter thing
1 : to fly to here
4 : to fly to here to give him that
3 : right
1 : yeah
3 : ok
4 : so that's one action right?
1 : mmhmm.
3 : well this doesn't count as my action though. cause it's a special action card.
1 : they don't?
4 : that's
1 : oh you're right it doesn't count as an action
4 : ok so yeah so do that
3 : yeah
3 : maybe i should just, well i could always fly myself to the fool's landing if it doesn't sink.
1 : yeah that's true
3 : umm
4 : yeah so use that
4 : and then where, where who are you?
3 : to just meet you all there
3 : so i'm blue
1 : you're
1 : you're blue right?
2 : i'm peach she's blue
3 : yeah i'm blue so i'm
1 : so
3 : going there
4 : so that's your move, and then this is the first action
3 : k this is my first action
1 : so that's one
1 : first action
4 : get rid of your lion
3 : yeah
1 : lion
3 : umm
2 : you can take it
3 : but then you're gonna fly both of us back but i mean i can
4 : first action
1 : i can do that because then you still have a
1 : helicopter lift if you need it
3 : yeah but i mean i have another action so if i
1 : right but the lift
3 : if i don't need to be on this
1 : the lift can also move other people like that aren't even like i'd you'd move her elsewhere.
3 : ok so then maybe
4 : i would just end if i were you
1 : well shore up
2 : yeah
4 : i don't think you need to do anything else. yeah.
3 : well
1 : like
1 : actually yeah it doesn't matter cause we don't these
2 : i can get these in the next one and then
4 : but we don't need to.
2 : true or he can ok
4 : so
1 : we could get all four and get like bonus points or something.
3 : i mean let's say i could i don't know
3 : i'll just, i'll just hang out.
4 : we have 8 minutes left
1 : if you want you can shore up or you can just end
1 : but there i don't see much a point in shoring up
3 : ok i'll just draw two
1 : if it'll make you feel better you can
3 : oh another helicopter lift
3 : but also water's rise
4 : ok
3 : yeah that fool's landing would've flooded.
1 : it would've, def like 100 percent
3 : cause it would have been on top
3 : oh ok so
1 : so we're still at three
3 : ok.
2 : twilight ok fool's landing is back under, watchtower
3 : oh so
4 : so get
4 : fool's landing
3 : twilight
1 : is out
