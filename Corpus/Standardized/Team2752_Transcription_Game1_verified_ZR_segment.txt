4 : ok
1 : well i can, i can shore up two adjacents, i don't think i can do it diagonally though
4 : no
1 : or can i?
4 : so you can get all four of that all four of those i guess
1 : umm
4 : if you shore up and then you move to the temples of the moon
4 : and then hit this
4 : breaker's and bridg
4 : like do these two, move here and do these two.
1 : and then
1 : can i can't do a diagonal though to shore it up.
4 : no, no, but
3 : so you'd move
4 : so go do these first
1 : just flip em
4 : yeah
1 : and then move.
4 : and then move over to the temple of the moon.
1 : can i move diagonally?
4 : no, that's just everyone
4 : no you can't.
4 : you could just move to here though
1 : oh i see what you're saying. ok
4 : and then you could do it again
4 : cause those are gonna come up as soon as the water's rise again.
1 : umm
1 : am i breaking any rule?
4 : i don't think so
3 : i hope not.
1 : so
1 : oh
3 : so that would be three actions.
3 : right?
1 : shore up two tiles for one action so and yeah that's three so i take uh
4 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : umm two treasure
4 : two treasure cards.
4 : yeah  if i wanna use like everyone's special actions as much as we can.
1 : good news, water rises
1 : so we're up
1 : we're still with two.
1 : and then umm
1 : what do we have to do?
4 : shuffle
1 : this goes
4 : yeah
1 : back
1 : there.
4 : yeah we shuffle those.
4 : and put em back on top
1 : 
4 : we shuffle discards and put em back on top
1 : where'd these come from?
4 : they're the ones that are already
4 : flooded.
1 : ok and then
4 : draw two.
1 : ok
1 : so we're flooding these right?
3 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : gold gate and lost lagoon.
4 : so golden gate's gone now?
4 : so i have to discard these
1 : did they set these up?
3 : which one is lost lagoon?
4 : and then lost lagoon
2 : lost lagoon is right here.
1 : where's lost lagoon?
3 : it's lost.
2 : alright
1 : ok
4 : ok
1 : so that
4 : then that goes back.
3 : gets discarded over here.
4 : oh wait no it goes back over there.
3 : wait
2 : the uh flood pile
3 : oh yeah
1 : does that go right back on top?
3 : no it goes over there.
4 : no no
2 : and right here.
4 : no up
4 : face up yeah.
3 : face up.
2 : yeah you're good.
3 : oh where'd the other one go?
1 : can i do anything else here?
4 :  discard it, we lost it.
2 : that was it.
3 : oh
2 : umm
4 : yup
4 : messenger.
1 : remember we can give each other cards too.
1 : because we gotta
4 : yeah but only during your turn.
4 : but
4 : yeah
1 : right
1 : cause we eventually have to get these things.
2 : yup
4 : yeah
2 : alright
2 : so i can't get to any tiles this turn
1 : which color are you?
2 : the gray here
2 : umm
2 : i can give away cards
3 : is anyone
3 : close to anything?
1 : oh you got one of them and one of them
1 : the red ones.
2 : k so i guess i'll move one and then i'll give away two cards for my actions.
4 : yeah
2 : umm i'll give you this
4 : ok
2 : and i'll give you this one.
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : and then
2 : i will
2 : i guess i move
2 : there
3 : ok
4 : ok
2 : and then i draw two cards
2 : umm
4 : yes
1 : so what's the advantage of having two? you can fly em
1 : is there something else?
2 : umm
3 : if i use the helicopter
3 : lift card i can move them both.
2 : yeah
3 : but i don't know if we
4 : yeah but i wanna save that till the end though
3 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
3 : i don't know how many there are of these in the deck, i have no idea.
4 : the
2 : yeah
4 : yeah me neither
2 : so we need at least one of them
4 : yeah
2 :  then
3 : yeah
2 : k
4 : and that could help us get there fast too  if anything's sinking at the end,
4 : before we leave.
3 : ok wait so now
2 : ok, now i draw two of these
1 : it seems like it being around the edges is not too smart cause if we, we sink
1 : tiles and strand somebody we're done.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : so
4 : temples of the moon
2 : ok,  cliffs
4 : hmm ok
2 : yeah
3 : alright
3 : so
3 : what can i do?
3 : umm
3 : i guess i uh
4 : if you wanna get like one of these two i could get
4 : these two in the middle.
3 : yeah so i guess i can use my power
3 : to fly here
3 : and then
3 : shore up this guy.
3 : so that's two
3 : and i guess i only,
3 : i only need two actions.
3 : and then i take two of these, right?
4 : mmhmm
1 : who can shore up diagonally, is that explorer?
4 : yeah i can do that, so i can
3 : k
3 : and then the
1 : you got two helicopter cards
3 : flood cards.
4 : nice
3 : so it is
3 : breaker's bridge and phantom rock.
3 : here, phantom rock would've been sunk so good call.
4 :  nice way
3 : uh then over there
4 : alright so i'll shore up
4 : diagonally
4 : and move here
4 : and then i'll shore up
4 : uh this one actually just so
4 : if it breaks you can go to the right one.
3 : yeah, smart
4 : uh and then two treasure cards
3 : got it?
4 : yeah
4 : thanks.
4 : alright
4 : k
4 : the only thing is, the only thing is we only have five so we should probably trade some of these away next time.
4 : umm and then two more of these guys.
4 : the whispering gardens and iron gate.
3 : iron gate's here
4 : uh
4 : k
4 : here is whispering garden
4 : ok
4 : cool
4 :  back to you engineer.
1 : well i'm allowed to shore up two at a time
3 : mmhmm
2 : you go
1 : but i have to move
1 : if i move here then i can hit
1 : both of them. does that seem smart?
4 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
4 : do you wanna trade anything first though? that's the only other thing
1 : uh do i do we have to do that first?
4 : no although
4 : well you're just gonna lose if you get two treasure cards you can only carry five so
2 : you have to discard two
1 : but i can choose at the time what to give away right?
4 : to throw away yeah, but we lose them as a group, that's the only thing.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : uh uh discard doesn't mean give away. oh you're right.
4 : yeah throw away
1 : uh which, what should i give here?
4 : let's see who
1 : we got
1 : three of us have chalices
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : you have five already
1 : maybe i should just give em to you.
3 : we have to be on the same
2 :  the same tile ok so you have to give it to me then?
4 : oh
1 : oh but you go
3 : tile
4 : yeah you can give it to him
2 : cause we're on the same
1 : you mean to give them we have to be on the same tile?
3 : unless you're the messenger.
4 : yeah he can be like the broker
3 : the messenger's power is he can give at anytime
1 : ok
4 : but is it, is it one move action per card though?
3 : yeah it's one action per card.
4 : so you're just giving one, just
2 : ok, so give me one
2 : yeah
4 : just so that we don't lose one.
1 : ok that's one,
1 : and then i
1 : go two and then
3 : but wait do you have to move? can you shore up both of these without moving?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
4 : he can't, he
2 : he can't do it diagonal?
1 : i can't do diagonal right?
4 : yeah no.
3 : oh
2 : just adjacent
1 : but if i move there that's umm
1 : second action and the third one i can do two of them.
4 : yeah that'll be, that'll work.
2 : yeah
4 : yeah it's good
1 : that seem good?
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : alright, we're floating.
3 : right now.
4 : k, treasure
4 : don't get a water's rise.
2 : oh
1 : do i have to pull cards?
3 : yeah yeah
1 : yeah
2 : cool
1 : oh boy
4 : well
3 : it's gonna be exciting.
1 : well yeah, now we're up three.
1 : so that goes there
1 : and we're
2 : umm well we have to have shuffle these and put them on the top
4 : no we shuffle those.
2 : and then draw.
3 : there's a lot going on in this game.
2 : yeah
1 : are we allowed to say how we're shuffling?
4 : no, no, i don't think so.
3 : i guess that's probably the point, is that you can't.
1 : then say we're not
1 : is that cheating, whatever you want is up there.
4 : you probably have to shuffle face down.
1 : i don't know if we're doing this were we supposed to do em that way
2 : put em face
3 : you shuffle em and then you put em on top and then you're gonna end up drawing some of those cards again.
4 : you probably shuffle them face down
1 : alright
1 : two of them right?
2 : uh three this time.
4 : three now, yeah.
1 : oh yeah i should've known that one
1 : ok, goodbye lost lagoon,
1 : breaker's bridge,
1 : where i'm
1 : floating.
1 : lost lagoon, that's handy.
2 : ok
1 : temple of the moon, didn't we we're getting the same one.
4 : temple of the moon, ok.
2 : oh
4 : right cause they, they come back up.
3 : cause you shuffled em, put em right on top.
1 : and as the water gets higher we're gonna get
1 : deeper and more of them are gonna start to float.
2 : mmhmm
3 : so we should try and i guess remember
4 : yeah
3 : the ones that keep coming up
4 : yeah
3 : cause they're gonna keep coming up.
1 : yeah
1 : ok so
3 : and remember to flip em.
4 : face up
4 : now
3 : face up, yeah
1 : face up?
4 : yeah
1 : umm
4 : k
1 : i'm done right?
4 : yup
3 : yes
2 : umm
4 :  that guy
2 : we should probably use
2 : two actions to shore up
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : umm
1 : the thing is if i stay there i can
1 : use it, i can do two at a time.
1 : maybe you don't,
2 : yeah
3 : but if one of us draws,
1 : maybe you don't have to waste your time
1 : on that.
3 : if one of us draws a
2 : umm
1 : on the other hand if they sink
3 : water's rise.
1 : then am i screwed?
1 : only if uh
1 : i'd have to be able to get to this one
2 : yeah
2 : maybe i could
1 : or this one.
2 : move to your tile again
2 : and get rid of ,
2 : and shore up the one you're standing on
2 : breaker's bridge
1 : that would be
2 : and then if these are still around you can shore up both of these in your turn
1 : yeah how come
2 : or maybe i should shore up two, i don't know. we might lose, we might lose one in the mean time.
4 : yeah might
4 : might as well, cause you can swim to places from there so it's not the end of the world if we
4 : this temples of the moon is probably more important since it has this guy in it.
1 : you know what though, if, if
1 : if the outer ones sink they're, they're no longer a threat to us cause they go in the box right?
2 : yeah that's true
2 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : just so we don't
2 : that's a good point though, we should definitely focus on these ones with the
2 : with the treasure icons on them,
2 : cause they're the important ones.
3 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : so i'll definitely shore up this one
2 : umm
2 : and then i guess i'll
4 : move here
4 : doesn't
2 : well
2 : does it matter if i move or not?
4 : yeah you could maybe shore up
4 : yeah maybe shore up breaker's and give that a chalice to the pilot
3 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : just so we
4 : been trying to
4 : i think we were trying to get him one too.
2 : yeah
1 : so there's two chalices right?
2 : mmhmm
1 : we can grab
4 : mmhmm
1 : but all we have to do is capture em
4 : we have to have four of em
3 : mmhmm
2 : 
4 : and be at that spot.
1 : four cards in just one person
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
4 : ok, treasure card
3 : can i ask you a question
3 : about the rules or
3 : no
3 : ok
4 : what?
3 : so
3 : i
3 : do you know if it's, if it's someone elses turn can they give me a card if i move to their space?
3 : or is it only you can give a card on your own turn?
4 : yeah i don't know
2 : you have to be on your own turn cause it counts as an action
4 : i think you have to give yeah
3 : oh
4 : yeah i don't think you can take
3 : ok
4 : yeah
4 : alright
2 : umm so i drew those
4 : two sandbags
2 : the four
2 : we also, we also have two of these if we decide to use them.
4 : unless i give you my
4 : umm
4 : lion
2 : i have umm
2 : two sandbags i can, i can shore up two tiles at anytime.
4 : yeah
4 : nice
2 : umm
1 : how do they work again?
1 : sandbags
2 : just play it at anytime and it can
2 : shore up any island,
2 : any tile.
2 : right
4 : yeah
2 : umm and it doesn't count as an action.
2 : so i don't know when we wanna use these
2 : i know, we gotta, we gotta make sure we probably wanna use them on this if that comes up
1 : does that
3 : mmhmm
2 : cause we don't want that to sink
4 : yeah
2 : so maybe i should save them for now since we haven't really lost much
4 : did whispering garden just get hit or it didn't?
2 : 
4 : like it's already been shuffled back in.
2 : and like that
3 : was it
3 : i was it started that way?
3 : or
3 : i don't remember
2 : it's been i think it, i'm pretty sure it's in the deck.
2 : i don't know are we allowed to look at these, i don't know.
4 : so maybe we wanna
4 : i don't think so
2 : ok
4 : that's the one
2 : i don't think it was one of the three that recently got
1 : didn't say we weren't allowed to
4 : that's the one that maybe we wanna save just cause it has the lion thing
2 : yeah
4 : but umm cause then i can give you my lions during my turn and you cause you are cause you can only hold five anyway.
2 : that's true umm ok
3 : but these don't count towards the five though
4 : oh they don't?
3 : i thought the special action ones do
4 : oh you're right, you're right.
3 : i'm not sure.
1 : yeah i don't think they count.
2 : oh they don't count towards your five cards?
4 : oh ok
4 : oh that's good
3 : i'm not positive.
4 : threasure cards
4 : including them, actually.
4 : yeah
3 : oh it does include them.
2 : ok
3 : ok
1 : yeah you can play them at anytime.
1 : they do not count as an action but you can't sandbag something once it's sunk.
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : i'm just wondering what if we get
1 : two fool's landings at the same pull and that thing's gone
4 : well we can't though, we'll have to get a water's rise. there's only one for each. but then if we get a water's rise in between then we can get fool's landing.
1 : yeah
4 : you know what i mean?
4 : because like
2 : right
2 : yeah
4 : this one is still
4 : it's still, like it's close to the top, we know that
1 : alright
4 : so that's the only thing
4 : but
2 : 
1 : oh i see what you're saying, we know it's not near, there couldn't,
4 : it's up to you
1 : there cannot be two near the top
2 : right
1 : so far.
1 : ok
4 : yeah, only the ones that are flipped have the chance of getting eliminated.
1 : ok
2 : i'll use my, i'll use one of these sandbags on umm
4 : ok
2 : whispering garden.
2 : ok, then i'll draw my flood cards.
4 : cool
3 : uh
3 : these ones first right?
4 : he did, he did this, yeah
3 : did you already you already did that?
2 : i already did, i did those, yeah.
2 : i'll take three of these
2 : oh wow.
3 : good call with that.
2 : so whispering garden,
4 : ok
2 : iron gate,
1 : but is it to our advantage just to let these outer ones sink?
4 : gone.
1 : and go away?
2 : oh sorry
4 : but not if they have that, the statues on them, that's what we need.
3 : i don't know.
2 : umm
4 : like cause we need to be at one of these places.
1 : true, ok
2 : ok, and the cliffs of abandon
2 : ok it's right there.
1 : now i guess if the card goes away we do go down deeper 
4 : right, yeah
4 : k
2 : alright
3 : so
3 : i don't really have many idea about
3 : what to do
2 : oh you might wanna grab
3 : umm
2 : oh never mind, we can't
2 : whispering garden isn't shuffled in yet
3 : but
1 : you're on chalice
3 : i can move what if i move here and then
3 : uh shore up both of these two?
1 : can you fly
2 : yeah
1 : you can fly anywhere at once?
3 : mmhmm
1 : i mean you're already in a good spot if we could get you these two cards you could
1 : capture
2 : yeah
3 : but then next turn i can just fly right back
4 : yeah
4 : if you end your turn where i am i can give you this
1 : true
4 : uh chalice
3 : wait you are
3 : ok
4 : i can end at the cliffs
4 : or close to there, i mean,
4 : either way.
2 : i don't know it might be
2 : whether you fly there for one turn
2 : that's one ac you could get
4 : yeah or we could fly there and shore up two
2 : you might wanna get
2 : i feel like we should get whispering garden again since we already
2 : been trying to save it
3 : mmhmm
3 : ok wait does it
3 : does shoring up
3 : shoring up is one action
2 : ok
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok
3 : so i could fly and shore up two
3 : or
3 : yeah
4 : yeah that's not bad
3 : and then you could use one of your
3 : turns to move
4 : yeah
4 : yeah
3 : so
3 : so i'll do that.
3 : thanks
3 : oh
4 : treasure
3 : alright, yeah treasure
3 : so we got fire
3 : and
3 : the other one.
4 : oh shoot
4 : but now we have to
3 : so yeah i have to discard now.
3 : so
3 : what don't we need?
3 : so i'm gonna definitely keep these guys
2 : mmhmm
3 : i feel like the helicopters could come in handy later
4 : yeah definitely.
4 : umm
1 : yeah after this card
3 : yeah
4 : maybe the li maybe a lion, since
4 : he's got two lions already
3 : since you guys already have the four
3 : then
4 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : earth or fire?
3 : i guess maybe the
3 : there is one
3 : then i can
3 : give the fire to you at some point.
4 : yeah
4 : not a bad idea.
1 : where's discards go, on the top?
3 : yeah
4 : yeah we can't get them back though.
4 : they're gone.
4 : yeah that's fine.
3 : does seem right.
4 : yeah
3 : gotta
3 : pick something
3 : and then uh
3 : the flood cards.
3 : k
3 : crimson forest,
3 : temple of the sun,
3 : and phantom rock.
3 : crimson forest is this guy
4 : phantom rock's gone.
3 : uh
4 : unless she's flipped it
3 : no i don't
2 : no
4 : ok
3 : so there you go,
3 : these guys go
3 : over there
4 : ok
4 : alright so
4 : actually now that i'm thinking about it maybe i'll just give you both of these
4 : so you can complete the
4 : umm
2 : ok.
4 : lion 
4 : one, two, three, shoot.
2 : or i could
2 : hmm
2 : never mind.
2 : maybe we should i could just come to you.
3 : yeah i can play this at anytime, i could move one of you
3 : where you need to go.
2 : hmm
4 : that's true
2 : i don't know if we need
2 : need that yet. i don't know how important that is.
4 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : i'm still three spots away from a
4 : yeah
2 : lion.
4 : hmm
2 : i could try to get to you at some point later.
2 : no, i don't know.
4 : let's see
2 : is there anything more important?
4 : or you could just trade it to me i guess wherever.
2 : yeah i could just send it to you
2 : that'd be easier
4 : so maybe i'll
4 : maybe i'll go here,
4 : give you this
4 : oh shoot but then you have to throw away well you can throw away the fire right?
3 : mmhmm
4 : not the end of the world.
2 : hmm
3 : do it, would i do that right now?
4 : or
4 : you have to yeah, or we could
4 : yeah
4 : do we wanna do that? i don't know
1 : i got two of them
4 : yeah i know
2 : where were you at?
4 : i was here, yeah
2 : were you here?
2 : you could also move one diagonal and shore up that one, cause you're explorer
4 : that's true
4 : oh yeah it has one of those things, yeah.
2 : yeah
4 : alright,
4 : yeah maybe i'll just do that.
3 : wait do you wanna keep this then?
4 : yeah, i guess i should probably save it.
2 : i feel like we should
2 : try to keep them alive as much as
4 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : actually you could
2 : wait never mind, that's not
2 : wait which one of these are flipped over? that's still up right? ok
2 : never mind
3 : if we are trying to get it, we should keep an eye on the time
3 : so i think, i think we used a lot of it already
4 : oh yeah
4 : yeah, ok i'm gonna go here, shore this up, then i'll go here, so then if you give me those
2 : oh
2 : what
1 : oh, i didn't know the clock was running.
4 : two, two of these, i can at least cash in. although i'm gonna have to throw something away now.
4 : we'll see what happens.
2 : 
4 : water's rise and a chalice so
4 : oh which one should i throw away?
3 : mm
4 : and
4 : it's tough
3 : good question
4 : uh
1 : you're here right now, huh?
4 : no i'm done here.
4 : umm
4 : the only thing is we don't have any of these, we only have one
2 : i guess 
1 : if we have lots of chalices, we could cash in if we could get em to uh
4 : one action
4 : i'll get rid of this one i
3 : oh wait, wait, wait
3 : actually keep the chalice cause next turn i can come to you and just give you both of these with my other two actions and that gives you four
4 : think
2 : well we also have to
2 : keep in mind how many of each we're throwing away
2 : we already threw away at least
2 : we've thrown away any chalices yet?
4 : oh that's true
3 : but look how big this deck is actually
3 : there's probably a lot
2 : uh huh
4 : yeah
2 : that's true.
1 : hopefully they're even now
4 : yeah so i'll throw away one of em
3 : yeah i have no, i have no idea what it looks like.
1 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : these guys i guess
2 : ok
4 :  we already give one of that's gonna sinks but
1 : we only have to get three out of four treasures anyway, right?
4 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : alright
1 : oh
2 : ok, so we're just gonna shuffle these
4 : yeah this goes up one.
2 : and draw three?
4 : yeah go for it.
3 : that clock moves
3 : so fast.
4 : temple of the sun, don't really
4 : whispering garden
4 : and
2 : breaking
4 : break
2 : bridge
4 : breaker's bridge
4 : 
4 : engineer
1 : help
1 : i can do two
3 : mmhmm
1 : and that would be one action, so
4 : mmhmm
1 : and then umm
1 : i probably should give you a chalice, right?
2 : well
1 : for a
4 : uh well he has two of them already umm
2 : it's gonna take more than one action, we he can't do a diagonal one.
2 : right?
4 : yeah
4 : no
2 : oh wait, where are you?
1 : this is me, and i can save these both in one action.
2 : ok
3 : yeah
4 : yeah, do that for sure.
2 : can you ok, never mind.
1 : and then
1 : umm and that would save you
1 : using up an action, you could just give him
1 : one chalice and then he'll have four when he gets to him.
1 : but are you near one?
4 : well, yeah i'm on one right now.
3 : he's on it right now, yeah
4 : umm
4 : he can get me two on his turn actually
4 : umm
1 : cause i don't know what else i should do.
4 : yeah i would shore those up and then if you come to me i can give you or he's gonna give me this 
3 : yeah, cause i'm gonna have nothing to shore up cause i'm moving to him
3 : here
3 : and then i'll have nothing around me to do, if nothing changes.
3 : so maybe just shore up
3 : and i'll use
3 : these.
1 : i'm just saying what should i do to use up my move?
1 : cause that's one move, that's one umm
3 : oh so you have nothing to do then?
1 : on action.
1 : no i can do two more things
1 : should i move or just stop
4 : you could give something to the messenger.
1 : give you cards?
4 : you could move to the messenger's spot and then give him something.
4 : just so that he can
4 : to trade it easier
3 : and the messenger can give it to anybody.
2 : yeah
2 : i can 
3 : it's bet it's better for you to have all the cards
4 : yeah
1 : is that, is that an action when i give him a card on the same spot? it is
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
2 : it says  good idea so i'm gonna need cards 
2 : giving these away
4 : yeah we gotta move
1 : ok so flip these two?
1 : right?
1 : flip em both
3 : yeah i think that's a good idea.
4 : yeah
1 : ok that's one action
2 : ok
1 : now i go two, three, but i can't give him a card
2 : oh i'm the, i'm the gray
3 : no, it would be here
4 : no, no, no, you can't
4 : yeah, go there
1 : oh ok
4 : and you can give him, maybe the purple one just so that
3 : and then you can
1 : ah and then
4 : cause we don't have
1 : but i'm not giving you a chalice, so maybe i should give you
4 : no, he's ok, he has two. don't worry about that
1 : ok
1 : alright
3 : yeah
3 : i think we're playing it right
4 : alright
1 : yeah and then what i get
2 : actually wait
4 : two treasure cards
2 : what if
2 : what if he gives me a chalice and so i can give it to him next turn cause i can't give away
2 : i can't give you two cards
2 : or i can, i don't know.
4 : we can fly to me and give me both the chalices and then we can just cash that out in one turn.
3 : yeah that's what i was thinking.
2 : ok
2 : whatever, let's just go with that.
2 : umm
4 : alright two treasure cards
3 : so then i your treasure
2 : so is that your fourth?
4 : cool
1 : helicopter lift, good we've got three of them
2 : ok, we should just use these lifts
3 : ok so those
3 : yeah, those are more common than i thought
1 : so i'm at five, i'm good then
1 : three of these, oh my gosh.
2 : ok, so this is gone.
4 : oh shoot
2 : and we lost the
2 : chalice
3 : we need the card also
4 : temples of the sun,
2 : no, not the chalice
1 : cliffs of abandon,
1 : crimson forest,
4 : gone.
3 : oh
2 : ok
4 : k
1 : well that's ok, those cards won't hurt us if there's
1 : duplicates in there.
3 : hopefully
4 : alright
4 : messenger
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : umm
3 : we're running outta time so fast
2 : ok
2 : uh
2 : so i can't really give you cards
3 : cause then you'd have to discard
4 : right
2 : oh, then i cann't give you
4 : but you could give it to him can you give him well then he has to do something
2 : i could give you one, we could just give up on the purple one
1 : just go back uh
3 : yeah
4 : well he's, if he doesn't give me the chalices the
4 : then i would have to get rid of all but one, yeah
2 : oh, he's giving you the chalices?
2 : uh
4 : i think that's what  bet
3 : oh yeah you're gonna have to discard
3 : two in the next turn anyway
4 : yeah
2 : so we're gonna have to find another of these then
2 : ah
3 : mm
3 : yeah we should
2 : jeez
4 : unless you end up can you get to
4 : one, two, three
3 : oh wait, i can move you right now
3 : to him
3 : and then
2 : i don't i can give him cards at any
3 : i know but he can't give you anything now.
4 : but if he flies me there later i can give him like
4 : my lions before
4 : uh i cash in the goblet things
1 : but you can
3 : we'd have to wait another rotation
4 : oh wait
4 : that's true, never mind. yeah
1 : you can fly two people at once
3 : yeah
4 : if they're on the same square
1 : for is that, it's one action for you when it's your turn
3 : it would just be this card
2 : yeah
3 : i don't does this count as an action?
2 :  you could fly us
2 : might be good if we're all on the same spot. you could fly us
1 : i think you can do it anytime
2 : to there.
3 : special action cards
4 : yeah you can doesn't count as an action
4 : it's just a it's just your card
3 : does oh yeah, it says right on it, does not count as an action.
2 : umm
2 : yeah uh i'll probably shore up this
2 : just do it for one action
3 : yeah
1 : yeah we can play em at this
1 : play em anytime
2 : umm
2 : i feel like we should get on the same spot maybe
2 : so we can trade cards cause we're gonna need to do that, i don't know.
2 : maybe you could
2 : we could all go there or all go there
2 : with one of the helicopter cards.
3 : i'll go to which one?
2 : i don't know, either there or there.
2 : just so we can trade cards
2 : in the next
4 : yeah, that's a good idea
4 : yeah maybe just come to there, cause he can come to me easier
2 : do we have
2 : ok.
4 : and then we can all
2 : oh yeah, ok
4 : yeah do you wanna play a lift, somebody?
2 : so
3 : yeah, wait, i'm confused just about what where you wanna go?
2 : use one of the helicopter lifts and fly us
4 : skip both
4 : these guys, see.
2 : yeah
2 : ok
2 : and then
2 : i have one more action
3 : i just hope that doesn't put us in trouble if these start flooding.
4 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : is there any cards
2 : that we're good to shore up?
2 : whispering garden
4 : maybe
3 : maybe save that for
4 : there was just yeah that's true
2 : save it, yeah
3 : for next turn
2 : ok, maybe i'll just end
4 : alright
4 : yeah
2 : k
2 : got two fire oh we forgot about
4 : oh that we have to use it
4 : you have to do something now.
3 : you have one, two, three, four
2 : what am i at, six?
4 : yeah
3 : five, six.
2 : umm
2 : i feel like we're not gonna get this
1 : well how many move how many actions have you to
3 : yeah that
4 : yeah that's right we only need three, so yeah
1 : how many actions have you taken?
3 : that's our least
4 : yeah let's just forget about that one
2 : umm
2 : well i already went through the action phase, i don't think i can do it again.
4 : yeah, he's done.
4 : now water's rise
3 : you already drew
4 : i mean, i mean the
4 : water's cards, yeah
1 : cause you flew him right, with your card?
1 : but
2 : yeah i had one action left but i think, there's just like
3 : yeah
1 : that doesn't count as an action for anybody
4 : it's, it's too late now. he already drew his treasure cards
3 : no
2 : a phase, oh
1 : ok
2 : tidal palace,
1 : cause i was thinking if he or
2 : copper gate,
1 : if he
2 : lost lagoon.
3 : once he draw, once he draws i think it's
4 : copper gate and what?
2 : lost lagoon,
2 : here it is.
4 : k
2 : ok, i'm done.
4 : k
3 : ok
4 : pilot
3 : so
3 : i'm gonna move here.
2 : umm wait
3 : right?
2 : ok yeah
2 : that's fine.
2 : 
3 : we're on the same
3 : and then
3 : other two actions are to give these two to you.
4 : ok and then i'll get rid of
4 : two of these these two.
2 : ok
3 : k then i draw two
3 : so we got lion and earth
3 : and then
4 : k
3 : flood cards, three of them.
4 : three of these
2 : caves of shadows,
2 : dunes of deception,
4 : caves of shadows
2 : silver gate
4 : silver gate, k.
4 : alright
4 : cool.
4 : they're with mine
4 : i'll cash these four in
4 : to get
4 : this
4 : bad boy
4 : and then
4 : i'll give you
4 : should i give you lion?
3 : oh wait i would shore up something.
4 : well i can do that too
4 : i'll still also have one more.
3 : oh oh
4 : i can shore up the dune
1 : i can do two of them from here
4 : or the shadows of the cave.
1 : as one motion if you'd
1 : think there's something else useful maybe you should do.
4 : yeah
4 : unless we hit it again oh wait it just, it just happens though, it just happened.
3 : yeah if we, if we get a
3 : if we get a flood ca
2 : ok i can get rid of this at anytime so i can shore up one of them, umm
2 : that way we'd need
4 : maybe
2 : i could just like do that one
4 : yeah, sure
2 : ok
4 : well we already have that one though.
4 : oh wait
3 : oh wait, wait, we just got the
3 : the chalice, right?
2 : oh, sorry, umm
1 : cause do we, do we wanna move you to the next one we need, like maybe
1 : here.
4 : well we're all pretty close, luckily.
4 : ah you're already this one
2 : yeah
4 : i mean
2 : actually we
2 : if we get a,
2 : if we get one of the water's rising we should
4 : well if we get it that's true, that's true, should we just do this one? cause we're all we have these three right in proximity, that's nice.
2 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : we actually don't have to move anywhere, we could just, we could stay and win like that.
2 : yeah
3 : just stay put.
2 : yeah
2 : k i'll use that
3 : on my little section
4 : alright and then i'll give you a lion
4 : or should i
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : give it to him cause he can give it to anybody
4 : ok
4 : alright then two treasure cards we have six minutes.
4 : alright
3 : time to pick up the pace
4 : and then three of these bad boys
3 : it's gonna be a
4 : one, two, three
3 : whispering
4 : cave of embers, howling garden,
4 : howling garden,
2 : you got howling garden?
4 : and bronze gate.
4 : k
2 : ok i'm good.
2 : then you can do these two
1 : k that's one move
2 : umm
1 : uh do you want me to give you these two?
4 : uh
4 : well he's got the lion uh he's close on lions.
3 : he, he can't take anymore
2 : mm
2 : yeah i'm gonna have to give it to you
4 : shoot
2 : probably.
2 : umm
4 : yeah i think we're
3 : yeah you should take the fire ones on his next turn
2 : 
2 : or you can give
3 : that way i can give you the
2 : oh though you guys both have spots open, maybe you should give two to
2 : him or something. like two fires
3 : that's a good idea actually, we're all in the same place
2 : let's just spread the cards around
4 : that's true
1 : ok, that'll be my moves then right?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : that's three.
4 : two i mean
3 : that's a good idea
1 : and then
2 : and two cards
1 : i guess i'm done.
2 : water rise
1 : they always have cards
2 : helicopter lift
1 : another helicopter lift
4 : that's true
3 : uh
4 : ok
3 : ok so those are definitely more common.
4 : k
1 : but we're still with three
2 : ok
1 : i don't think we're shuffling these
2 : yeah
1 : water's rise
3 : it's gonna be down to the wire

4 : thank you
2 : and then
2 : do i have to be on the tile to claim it or just adjacent to it?
4 : on it i think, yeah.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, i'm concerned that we get that cause that one's really far away.
2 : ok, so i'm gonna move
2 : i think i'm gonna move to here so i can
2 : claim this no, i don't know, it probably won't matter.
2 : is there anyth
4 : the only thing is he'll have to come to you to give you the other lion, that's i mean
2 : oh yeah never mind i shouldn't move. ok
2 : umm
2 : i don't know if there's anything useful i can do right now
4 : yeah
2 : i don't think, i'll just
4 : ok
4 : you should go quick, four minutes
3 : uh
1 : if, if you, if you give him the last one can he grab that one?
1 : or does he have to wait for his, for his next turn, yeah
3 : on his next turn
4 : yeah he has to wait
