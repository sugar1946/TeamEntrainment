1 : so i'll shore
1 : these, move
1 : shore these
1 : that's three
1 : and then i take two cards
1 : iron gate and oh oops
1 : oh treasure deck sorry
2 : treasure deck yeah just put them under it
3 : treasure cards
1 : well no these will go at the top still
2 : oh ok alright
1 : water's rise
3 : hmm
1 : and this so
1 : bring that up to there
1 : shuffle the flood
1 : discard pile
1 : oh i'm sorry
1 : and now i draw two
1 : cliffs of abandon and breaker's bridge
3 : oh yeah you can get in position and shore them up again
1 : yup
1 : alright
2 : alright
2 : one
2 : can i turn these over?
1 : umm you can turn that one over but
2 : what?
1 : next turn i can
2 : oh
1 : move both of them if
2 : not this one
2 : umm
2 : let's see, can i move again?
3 : you have three actions yeah
2 : yeah
2 : that's three take two treasure
2 : uh one
2 : two
2 : nice
2 : i shore up again and i have this
2 : so i'll shore up on any one tile
1 : i would wait to use that
2 : use that yeah
2 : and this one
1 : what's the other treasure card that you have?
2 : these two
2 : they're over there 
1 : ok
1 : so we should start thinking about how to get
3 : yeah
1 : people with all of the same kind
2 : ok
3 : yeah that's all i got
2 : oh
1 : i guess you have to draw two of these and then
2 : two of these
2 : ok
2 : whispering
2 : garden
2 : and gold gate
2 : 
3 : hmm
2 : here it is so i can turn that over
1 : well no that one was
2 : that
1 : sunk so
2 : you have to keep it there
3 : now it's sunk
1 : well it's
1 : sunk now because it was flooded before
2 : uh oh 
3 : and that's gone
2 : ok
2 : alright so now i can get rid of these
1 : i think this one goes in the uh like
1 : discard pile over there though since
2 : oh ok
3 : those two don't
2 : now i have to take these two
1 : wait you just drew
2 : oh
3 : then you just, you just got then
1 : so put them at the top i guess
2 : i
2 : ok
2 : alright
2 : then i'm done there
3 : yeah good
3 : three two, umm
3 : i can fly anywhere
3 : uh
3 : i can only draw two treasure cards at the end
1 : yeah
3 : i'm thinking i'll fly here, flip this over
1 : is there any reason that
1 : we need this one though?
1 : i mean if we lose it doesn't mean anything to the game.
2 : yeah, it doesn't have one of them
3 : any other ideas?
2 : no
1 : you could
1 : hmm
3 : umm no
1 : i'll shore these
1 : but
1 : you could just move here and shore both of them since
1 : there's nothing better to do.
3 : that's what i'm saying i might as well get here and shore this up.
1 : yeah
1 : or
1 : either way
1 : just go ahead it's
1 : a matter of time i suppose
3 : and another move
3 : umm
3 : yeah just skip it
3 : umm
3 : draw
3 : two
3 : and
3 : two water
3 : phantom rock lo
3 : lost lagoon
3 : that's funny
3 : phantom rock
3 : lost lag
2 : we have to think about this thing here, when is that we move that up, is that any one
1 : umm only when we draw the water's rise
2 : ah just the water ok
1 : i think those go in the discard pile
3 : yeah
2 : oh
1 : so my turn
1 : let's see
1 : shore these, both of these up
1 : and i'll start moving towards this because i already have two of them.
1 : unless you guys have any
3 : yeah i got one to give you
1 : alright
1 : and then i draw two of the treasures.
1 : so this is already almost done.
3 : now you have three
1 : and then
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon
2 : ok i guess it's my turn if i'm up here
1 : yeah
2 : 
1 : so you could shore this just in case
2 : 
3 : yeah
2 : 
2 : ah and then
2 : this is two, two other actions
2 : umm
2 : can i mo hit you here?
1 : yeah that'd be a good idea because then i can give you this when my turn starts.
2 : yeah ah
2 : ok
3 : yeah
2 : that's two and then the third one
1 : you don't have to do a third one, it's probably good to wait there.
2 : it said one,  ok then two treasure
2 : uh oh we finally got this
3 : oh
1 : so we move this up to three then.
3 : boomer
2 : 
1 : and then
2 : 
1 : discard this
2 : down there
1 : and shuffle that
2 : and this one's
2 : one of the kings
3 : this is it
2 : this is it?
3 : shouldn't this go up here?
3 : treasure discard
2 : i don't know
3 : yeah
2 : this one i guess i can hold on to.
2 : then i can get th
2 : to the water level i get three of these.
1 : yeah
3 : it's not a three though
1 : no it just moved up to three
2 : no he just moved it
1 : because we did it twice
1 : because i, i drew the card on my first turn
1 : and so it went up from
1 : novice to normal and then it went up again just now
3 : oh
2 : oh
3 : when
3 : you can push it up
1 : hmm?
3 : you push the notch up physically
1 : yeah
2 : so this
1 : it is, it's here
3 : oh i'm
3 : i was thinking this would be three
2 : oh this one
1 : no this whole, this whole like blue section's three, yeah.
3 : umm yeah ok alright alright yeah you're right, you're right
3 : my bad
2 : temp temple of the moon
1 : no worries
2 : temple of the moon
2 : mm no
1 : that's this one
2 : and then that thing is over
2 : and then iron gate
3 : ah
2 : 
1 : so
2 : yeah stick it over there
1 : iron gate had
1 : no it didn't have one
2 : like it or not
2 : i guess it's your turn
1 : oh i'm sorry the ah that one got it
2 : oh
1 : discard so
1 : this one goes in here
2 : umm
3 : makes sense
3 : alright so
3 : what can i do, umm
1 : so you could
3 : i'm going to
1 : move over here and give me that card so that it could
1 : umm have another one of these
1 : and then
2 : how did you luck out with all of those
3 : i need three though
1 : luck
2 : just lucky
3 : yeah he only
3 : you only need three though i think
1 : no you need four for it
2 : we should all move to this and then get out of town
3 : mm alright what else can i do umm
2 : get out of town
3 : two more moves
3 : i'll
3 : push this thing.
1 : oh you may only have five so
1 : i have to discard one
1 : umm
1 : that was ah
1 : dumb choice on my
1 : mm
2 : you wanna give any out?
1 : i can't give them though
3 : yeah
2 : ah
3 : not yet
2 : how about if i give you this
2 : you give me that
3 : what's the red thing, .
1 : umm this is my, my card like.
3 : ah
1 : can we undo a move that we've
1 : made or is it too late?
1 : ok
2 : i can give
1 : so
2 : treasure card to a player anywhere for one action.
1 : wait
1 : in that case
1 : take this one back
1 : so they don't have to discard.
1 : and then i'd recommend moving here to shore that so that we don't lose
1 : the treasure
1 : although the treasure's here
3 : so i did just shore this thing up
1 : ok
3 : but i can fly
3 : so
3 : fly here
3 : and shore this baby up
3 : that's a problem
1 : well
1 : no it's fine just switch the
1 : ok
1 : was that four?
1 : ok so which one should we undo then?
1 : sorry
1 : umm this was unshore, this was
3 : yeah
1 : shh
2 : mm
1 : sorry about that
1 : umm
1 : so then did you draw the ah
1 : flood cards?
3 : mm do i draw two of these?
1 : no i don't think so
2 : 
2 : is he still on his turn or did we skip a turn? oh his turn is still ok
1 : he's on his turn still
3 : alright so which one to get rid of?
3 : i'll keep this one for you
3 : i think i'll
1 : we should probably
1 : give up on this because
3 : yeah
2 : i have one of these
3 : this dis
3 : that and
3 : three flood cards
3 : lost lagoon, whispering garden, breaker's bridge
1 : what's the second one?
3 : mm ah
3 : break
3 : whispering garden
1 : oh and breaker's bridge
3 : yeah
1 : and then
3 : lost lagoon
1 : ok
1 : ok
3 : oh these go to flood discard except for
1 : so then
3 : lost lagoon
1 : i would start
2 : ok
1 : going to
1 : give you this one
2 : ok
1 : umm
1 : then
2 : i have to get rid of one
1 : move here
1 : and shore both of these
3 : oh we, we kind of gave up on this 
2 : yeah
1 : yeah so
2 : what about
2 : if i use this for anything?
1 : yeah you could use that
3 : on your turn you could but right now he gave it to you
2 : on on my turn. see i have six cards now
3 : so you gotta
3 : give up
1 : oh wait wait
1 : this one first.
1 : so
1 : right
1 : flood cards
1 : phantom rock
1 : howling garden
1 : crimson forest
1 : ok
1 : and then your turn
1 : so
2 : well i told them yes so
1 : he yeah
3 : yeah you gotta get rid of that one
1 : i guess you either have to use the sandbag
1 : or discard a card
2 : yeah
1 : umm
2 : i don't know
2 : doesn't count as your
2 : one tile on the island
2 : shore up
1 : so you get to shore up this since it's
2 : this one?
3 : yeah why not
2 : then do i just discard this
1 : yeah
2 : over here? ok
3 : yeah
2 : now is it my turn now? so i have to
2 : move
2 : guess i could move here
2 : umm
1 : well
3 : what
2 : no
2 : what, what
2 : 
3 : and that was three turns wasn't it?
2 : 
2 : three actions
2 : is that that doesn't count as action.
1 : that didn't count
3 : oh yeah, yeah
2 : oh so i can do this
3 : it's
1 : well you don't want it to be
3 : that's a bet
2 : no, no
3 : this is good right now
1 : flooded
2 : then ok what about if i change this?
1 : you have to be next to it though
3 : y
3 : yeah
2 : well can i move one more?
1 : that would actually be a good place to move because
3 : you didn't
2 : 
2 : yeah
1 : we can start giving you more of these
2 : yeah
3 : yeah yeah yeah
2 : yeah ok
2 : and then one more
3 : 
2 : action
1 : oh give him
1 : ah this card
2 : yup
1 : yeah?
2 : alright that's a good idea.
2 : and then i get two of these.
2 : uh oh, i got these.
1 : oh another one.
2 : 
2 : another one
2 : see i don't know if you'd move
2 : in that same thing
2 : for water one tick mark
3 : oh
2 : so it's just still on three
3 : yeah we
3 : we gotta immediately discard it
2 : and this one's what you need.
1 : yeah i think you do have to
2 : so
3 : yeah i gotta immediately do
3 : i'm thinking helicopter lift card
1 : yeah
2 : ah
1 : you practically have that ability
1 : not quite but
2 : i bet i
1 : wait
1 : you have to wait until it
2 : are we up to
1 : now you can draw three
2 :  three
2 : because it went up
3 : lucky us
2 : ok
2 : crimson forest, where is that now
3 : umm
2 : there
2 : 
2 : temple of the moon
2 : and that would be discarded here.
3 : oh yeah
2 : ok and cliffs of abandon
2 : cliffs of abandon where is that?
2 : oh
2 : so you stay on there and then discard there
2 : ok now it's your turn you always take ten minutes so it's long.
3 : i'm gonna flip this boy
2 : heh
3 : umm
3 : you're trying to get this thing right?
1 : yeah but
1 : i don't know if i should
1 : give up on
1 : ah one of these cards since
1 : these are the treasure we're closest to
1 : i'd have to discard if you gave it to me
3 : how else are we going to do it though?
1 : umm let's wait
1 : we could wait for that one.
3 : i flipped it i'm going to
3 : can you
3 : i'll go move here and flip this alright?
1 : or umm
1 : if you move to where i am i can
1 : shore both of these in one move
1 : and give you the card.
1 : so
3 : that's good
3 : and
3 : i'll use
1 : well there's not point if i'm going to
3 : no point
1 : shore both
1 : unless we lose one of them
3 : might as well cause i'm gonna give up one anyway right?
1 : ok, right, right.
3 : he just picked cliffs of abandon right?
1 : umm he picked both of them i think.
3 : yeah he did
3 : ok i'll just pick this then.
1 : ok
1 : so then draw the two and then
1 : or from the
1 : the normal one right?
3 : my bad
3 : i think i'll just
3 : put them right back.
1 : well you get one extra card.
1 : you're
3 : oh i have four, my bad.
3 : yeah this we gave up on so i'll just take this.
1 : ok
3 : and the
3 : flood
1 : yeah three of these
1 : yeah three of these
3 : howling garden, whispering garden, breaker's bridge
3 : oh good thing.
1 : ok umm
1 : so i'll start off
1 : giving you this one
3 : thank you
1 : and then
1 : i'll
1 : shore up both of these
1 : and move one here
1 : so then i draw two of these
1 : thank you
2 : i have to remember the color.
3 : oh good
1 : ok
2 : how come i have five? i always thought it was four, but i have two of these
2 : i know i'll give you one of these
1 : great
2 : umm
1 : so i'll
1 : get rid of
1 : this one
3 : yeah, yeah
1 : and then i'll draw these three
1 : silver gate
1 : cave of embers and copper gate
1 : cave of embers is here.
1 : oh that's cave of shadows
3 : that's right here, where's cave of copper gate
1 : and that
3 : right here
1 : ok
1 : so now it's your turn
2 : ok
1 : umm
1 : if you
1 : give him this card
1 : we can
1 : get that treasure next turn
3 : he has to be on the same square though right?
1 : no he's the
1 : messenger so that's his power
3 : i can get anyone, awesome
2 : ah
3 : alright
3 : umm
3 : he can give you the red one correct?
2 :  kinda give you this one for one action.
1 : but then i lose one of these is the problem.
2 : hmm
3 : oh
1 : so we might want to wait until next turn
2 : 
2 : alright
3 : so i'm gonna get rid of
2 : then umm
3 : this
1 : if
2 : if i move here
1 : well
2 : i could get rid of
1 : if you move here
2 : it'd be there yeah
1 : and shore it just in case
2 : yeah
1 : then i can give you
1 : both of these next turn.
2 : ah
2 : that's the second one
2 : and the third
1 : if you shore it up just in case
2 : shore here?
1 : no umm
2 : umm
1 : flip this one
2 : alright just flip that one?
2 : now do i still have one more action?
1 : i don't think so
2 : no then? alright we turned it over so i get
2 : two of these
2 : so that leaves me with five and this one
2 : i have to get rid of hmm
1 : i think we gave up on this treasure.
2 : this one, yeah
2 : should i just
2 : get rid of one?
2 : and keep one?

3 : fly myself
3 : up here
3 : do i get rid of these cards somehow?
1 : yeah you trade them in there and then you just take them.
3 : oh yeah
2 : i guess 
3 : and
2 : 
3 : move up figurine in front of you
1 : oh treasure card pile
1 : i think that's three
3 : does
1 : or
3 : does it count as a turn to cash our treasure?
1 : yeah it does
3 : alright
1 : alright
1 : so then you draw.
3 : well i just flew up there and
1 : oh so that's two but you don't really have anything else to do so

1 : you'll have to discard but
3 : mine is easy
1 : well

2 : oh this would be the only one unless i give you one of those back
2 : cause you need one
3 : the lion, the lion we gave up on.
2 : so should i just give it to him like that?
