1 : mk
1 : so
1 : umm
1 : umm
2 : and then maybe
1 : three
2 : shore that up
1 : shore this up now?
2 : yeah since it has one of the it's one of the place we could
2 : obtain that
2 : wind statue i think that's called.
1 : so i can shore this up
1 : because i
1 : went on it?
1 : is it
2 : because you're on it or because you're next to it right?
3 : ok
3 : next to it, right.
1 : oh ok
3 : you can do up to three of those so you could do
1 : oh right ok so move adjacent i just did that now i can
1 : shore up because it's adjacent
1 : and
3 : you could do two more if you wanted to
1 : i can
1 : i
1 : oh ok, i could
1 : move
3 : no no you can shore up.
1 : adjacent
1 : two more
1 : oh ok so this one
3 : right.
1 : so that was three
1 : i moved adjacent, then i shored up and then i, ok
2 : yeah and flip that one
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : ok
1 : oh wait
2 : then you draw these
1 : draw two treasure deck cards please
1 : thank you
1 : umm
1 : mk
1 : so i have to do something with the water's rise
1 : so move the water level up one tick
2 : we
2 : yeah
1 : shuffle the flooded discard pile and place it one top of the
1 : flood draw pile
1 : umm discard this card to the treasure
1 : discard pile
2 : and then we have to take two of these right?
1 : k
1 : mm
2 : oh
3 : no
1 : i don't think so
2 : cool
3 : no
2 : that's fine
1 : umm
1 : and now, oh well now i do
2 : yeah
1 : draw two
1 : draw flood cards equal to the water level which is two, ok.
1 : umm so i have whispering garden and cliffs of abandon
1 : whispering garden
3 : ok
1 : ok and then discard, ok
2 : those go here
3 : those go there
2 : alright, so then
2 : end of turn
1 : done, ok
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : i will
2 : move here as one
2 : i will shore this up
1 : ok
2 : as two
2 : and
2 : probably
2 : shore up cliffs of abandon as well
1 : k
1 : ok can you do that?
1 : shore up two?
1 : i'm not sure, cause i thought that
1 : the engineer does two, right?
2 : take up to three actions
1 : because didn't each one have
1 : a couple like
1 : you can do certain things
1 : i thought
2 : yeah i could
2 : give cards from a different place
1 : yeah
1 : where's my card?
1 : ok
1 : shore up to two tiles for one action.
1 : so then
2 : for one action. so i used my two actions. one to flip this and one to flip that one.
1 : hah, oh
1 : ok gotcha, alright.
2 : yeah
2 : umm ok so then done with that one, and now i take these two
1 : mmhmm
2 : so i have a sandbags and two of these
2 : whatever they are
2 : and
2 : sandbags as well
1 : mmhmm
2 : then i'll flip this
2 : two of these right? is that
1 : ah
1 : two yeah cause it's still on two
2 : ok
2 : so phantom rock and lost lagoon
2 : phantom rock has just sunk
1 : ok, i don't see
2 : so has lost lagoon
1 : oh
2 : alright
1 : umm
1 : i
1 : think that's it
2 : and that's it then the next
3 : ok so i get to move
3 : adjacent
3 : one time
2 : gotcha
1 : oh
1 : ok
2 : so are those, lost lagoon and phantom rock, are those?
3 : yeah, phantom rock and lost lagoon
3 : do they
3 : do they go just 
2 : those
2 : no those are also cause they're
1 : yeah
2 : sunk now
3 : they're done mmhmm
1 : they're done
1 : all done
3 : ok i ah, i can to draw two treasure car well two treasure cards
1 : ok
3 : one, two
3 : helicopter lift again
3 : and
3 : that
3 : and then i can
3 : oh i have to draw three, draw flood cards equal to the water level
1 : which is two right now.
3 : two right?
2 : did you want to move anywhere as well?
1 : one, two
3 : well i can do that too afterwards
2 : ok
2 : ok great.
1 : ok
3 : and so we have i have to flood golden gold gate and breaker's bridge so
3 : gold gate
3 : is done
1 : ok
1 : and throw that card out
2 : and so that card will go out as well
3 : yeah 
3 : and breaker's bridge
2 : also done
3 : is also done well this is getting
1 : yeah
3 : slim here isn't it?
2 : goin quick
1 : oh
3 : and i can shore up, there's nothing to shore up.
3 : ok
1 : ah ok yeah
3 : and i can give a treasure tile
3 : if on same card so
3 : i
3 : nothing, ok and i'm gonna stay there too, on helicopter landing just in case you know something happens we can all get off of there right?
1 : ok
2 : right
2 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : so i'm i'm i'm gonna propose a strategy then of that next time we shore up things before drawing the forbidden island.
3 : ok
2 : yeah so that
1 : if we're
1 : wait what did, oh ok.
2 : in case we right cause, although i don't know if we could have if you were anywhere
3 : right
2 : close except that you could have probably flown to them
3 : i could have moved to one one of those
3 : four there are already there anyway
2 : but yeah, well and but you can fly anywhere anytime as well, so
3 : well i can fly anywhere that's true
1 : oh
2 : alright
1 : ok
3 : oh, ok well i wanted to stay there just
2 : yeah oh yeah for sure
3 : yeah just to that's
2 : well now i'm gonna hold on to the sandbags so that in case that one gets
3 : ok
3 : there you go
1 : yeah
1 : oh
3 : ok
1 : umm
1 : ok so
1 : let me look at this again
2 : umm
1 : ok move adjacent, shore up we don't need, give a treasure card
1 : umm
1 : we need four treasure cards to
2 : mmhmm
1 : collect it?
3 : three out of four, oh yes four treasure cards
1 : ok
3 : three treasures
1 : umm
1 : ok so now
1 : umm capture a treasure
2 : so which one do we think we could
1 : so i think i'm gonna m
1 : move
1 : adjacent
1 : oh
1 : i'll just do
2 : we could move there and then
1 : one two three
1 : right and that'll just be
2 : then those are your three, those are your three turns?
3 : well aren't you
3 : what's that one, what is who you have right there, who are those?
1 : this?
2 : those are the fire things.
3 : yeah
1 : the fire things
2 : so you could move here, here and then here.
2 : to the cave of shadows
1 : put them on
2 : and be close
1 : oh and then if one of you guys get the card then i could collect it
2 : yeah if they're on the same or if i get the
1 : oh
2 : fire then i could give it to you from wherever i am
3 : right
1 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : one two three
3 : there right?
1 : that would make more sense
1 : umm
2 : then you get
1 : two
2 : these two
1 : right ok
1 : umm
1 : sweet
1 : ok
3 : there you go, so now you got it
1 : yeah
2 : we're gettin closer now.
1 : umm and then
1 : wait i can have
1 : up to five ok
2 : yeah
1 : and then draw
1 : flood cards equal to the
1 : number which is two
1 : iron gate and temple of the moon
3 : well now you have too many cards
3 : you need, you're allowed up to five cards so you have to discard
2 : right but these, these are flood cards
1 : there
3 : oh those are flood cards, ok
1 : yeah
2 : not an action
1 : umm
1 : so
1 : temple of the moon
1 : and
1 : iron gate
3 : over here
1 : ok
1 : up
1 : and
1 : done
2 : done
3 : do you get to take the treasure
2 : ok
2 : ah not yet
1 : ah not yet because
1 : like
1 : you need to give me on your turn
1 : well you need to take
3 : i'll give you one of these
1 : you need to take one of your actions up by giving me that treasure card, yeah
3 : ok gotcha ok
2 : ok
2 : umm
2 : let's see
3 : don't sink it
2 : alright, i'll try not to
1 : yeah
2 : is there, i can't get to any of them to
2 : flip
2 : just yet
2 : i mean i could over there in three moves but then i couldn't ah
2 : i wouldn't have a move left to flip
2 : or to shore up
1 : yeah
2 : umm
2 : i'm gonna
2 : i don't necessarily need to be
2 : close to you guys to be able to hand card cause i could do that from anywhere
3 : right
1 : mmhmm
3 : well i i could also fly on my turn
2 : yeah ok
3 : right to there
3 : and then hand her this card
2 : perfect ok so that's good
3 : right
1 : oh you need to be on the same one with me in order to give it me?
2 : yeah he does
3 : it says
1 : oh
3 : give a treasure card if on same tile
1 : oh ok
2 : so
1 : k
2 : i'm gonna go towards the
2 : temple of the moon just in case i am able to
3 : ok sure
2 : one, two
2 : oh two and then i can flip this up with my third remaining turn
1 : ahhh
3 : ah there you go
1 : clever

2 : so then i take these two
2 : water's rise, dammit
1 : oh
2 : and the griffin so water's rise
2 : do i
2 : put
2 : over in there?
2 : i can't remember where, the water's rise
1 : move
3 : right here, right here
1 : ok
2 : oh yeah that's right
1 : move what a level up?
2 : move that
2 : goes up
2 : i shuffle these up
3 : are there three of them?
2 : there's, there's four at least
3 : ok
2 : and draw three of them now.
2 : correct?
1 : mm

1 : yay!
2 : alright.
3 : does that count?
2 : yeah
1 : yes
3 : yeah that counts
3 : and then i can shore up something
3 : let's shore this up, what do you think?
2 : ah it has to be adjacent
3 : oh ok i can't do anything
2 : or one of the
2 : so
3 : umm
2 : unless you wanted to fly
2 : somewhere else
3 : i could only, let me see
1 : why, do we have
1 : we have a lot of the
1 : the lion one
1 : so maybe if you flew
3 : so
1 : over there cause this one's about to sink
3 : but if i fly there can i, oh ok
3 : then i'd be swimming so i have to fly
3 : let me fly
1 : would it be better to fly over to that one
3 : what if i flew back to here?
2 : well
1 : i'm not sure how much that would
1 : help
2 : someone needs to have all
2 : four of the
2 : statue cards so

2 : piece.
3 : oh gotcha ok  so i go here
1 : mmhmm
3 : that's one
2 : and then you can
1 : give me that

1 : why don't you move closer to something?
1 : that you can shore up
3 : yeah i'll
3 : i'll move here
2 : do you want to get
1 : well which one do we need
2 : closer to the
3 : well i'll go if i move here then
2 : mm
1 : this one
2 : right but you're
2 : close here anyway
2 : that you could move one, two and collect it
2 : cause you have the four cards next time. so i don't we don't necessarily need the temple of the moon.
1 : right
3 : ok one, oh one two ok.
1 : oh
2 : wait
2 : how many
2 : items did you use?
3 : 
3 : i use
3 : i i used
3 : two this is my third.
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : that's my third
1 : and you want to move there cause you want to be close to this?
1 : blue one
3 : right
3 : right, right
2 : ok
1 : so that's the next one we need
3 : right
2 : ok
1 : ok
3 : or, yeah or if that goes we don't care if that goes. well no we, well right
2 : well we'll wait until next turn when she's able to
3 : ok now i have to draw two treasure cards
2 : collect this hopefully
3 : one
2 : oh so you have too many
1 : oh right
1 : umm
2 : so you need to discard one of them and if he's got more
1 : so i'm gonna
2 : well
1 : so the
1 : blue thing again
3 : these don't count as these are
3 : special cards ok two and i need three flood cards
1 : one, two, three four five
1 : three, one, two
1 : three
2 : this includes
1 : this includes 
3 : oh it includes special action cards ok so i have to get rid of those
3 : so
3 : i might get rid of these two since i already have one
1 : wait but you can have
1 : five
2 : yeah so hold on to one of the
1 : just one yeah, mmhmm
3 : ok crimson forest flood
2 : crimson forest where is that?
3 : right here
2 : ok
1 : hah
3 : and cave of embers we flood.
2 : and that's gone.
2 : but that's fine because we already have that treasure
3 : and silver gate we flood
1 : ok
2 : silver gate
3 : that, i've never heard of that, oh here it is. that one's ok
1 : ok
3 : ok we're done
1 : umm
1 : ok so you're done?
3 : i'm done
1 : ok
1 : umm so
1 : i'll
1 : take
2 : well you need to move to the
1 : oh right
2 : that piece first
1 : one
1 : i just need one right? i just need to be adjacent to it? or on it?
2 : not you need to
2 : no you need to be on it to collect the
1 : oh ok
1 : two
2 : item.
1 : three
1 : thank you
2 : and then so those go in the discard
1 : ok
1 : almost there!
2 : alright
2 : well done so we just need one more.
1 : umm so
1 : i'm assuming we're gonna
1 : try to do the lion one.
2 : yeah
1 : so
2 : do you have, so that was your
2 : third move there right? ok.
1 : that was my third
1 : so draw two treasure cards.
2 : cards
1 : cards umm so two
3 : oh cool, ok
1 : so
1 : k
2 : and then
3 : and then your three three crummy flood cards
1 : then
1 : draw
1 : three flood cards
1 : umm
1 : so cliffs of abandon
1 : howling garden
1 : and bronze gate
3 : howling garden and bronze gate ok
1 : which doesn't matter
2 : right here
1 : howling
3 : oh
3 : i need cliffs of abandon flood card
3 : please
1 : oh that's all done, yeah ok
3 : right right thank you
1 : and
1 : and, ok.
1 : flood
2 : ok
2 : my turn?
1 : yeah
3 : yes
2 : does not count as an action, i'm going to save i'm gonna sandbag up howling garden right here.
1 : good idea.
2 : cause that's where we're headed.
2 : umm
2 : and
2 : i am here
2 : and i forget if i'm trapped like that and can't move
2 : side to side can i move anywhere?
1 : you can move up
2 : ok
1 : or wait
1 : wait
1 : you just took one action up right?
3 : which one
2 : i haven't used an action yet.
1 : didn't you sandbag?
2 : it says the special cards don't use an action.
1 : oh so what if you
1 : oh well i guess that doesn't
1 : no
2 : we already have that treasue so at this point
3 : you
3 : you're not allowed to move diagonally it's only engineer right?
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : but i'm
1 : i'm thinking
1 : because if this sinks then you're
1 : in the middle of the ocean and then you can't do anything and then the games over.
1 : so if you
2 : right
1 : flip this over
2 : mmhmm.
1 : mm
2 : cause i can't move anywhere anyway
1 : that's
1 : or yeah so flip it flip it over
2 : and then i'm gonna give somebody a
1 : and then just
2 : card who's close to getting one
3 : i have two of these
1 : yeah give him
2 : so i'm gonna give you
3 : well then i'm gonna have to get rid of a card too, though
2 : ok
3 : that which is fine. i have two helicopter lifts i'll just get rid of
1 : oh
2 : well unless oh cause you can only use them on your turn
2 : umm right?
2 : or no thyey can be used at any time
3 : right
2 : where's the helicopter lift
3 : play at any time.
2 : you can move one or more pawns on the same tile to any other tile.
2 : hmm.
2 : so you
2 : wait if you you could use one of the helicopter lift cards to move me
2 : closer
3 : right but i have two of those already

2 : thinking in terms of if you can only have five at a time if you wanted to use one of those
3 : or
2 : preemptively
2 : like now
3 : oh like now?
2 : just to
