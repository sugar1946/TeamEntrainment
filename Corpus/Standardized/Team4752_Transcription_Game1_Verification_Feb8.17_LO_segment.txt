1 : oh we start flipping cards, we wanna make sure these ones don't sink
4 : yeah
1 : and fool's landing
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
1 : so i'll go first
3 : yup
2 : mmhmm
1 : umm
2 : let's see what all cards does everyone has
1 : ok
1 : there's no one really to give these cards to so i'll keep them
1 : so first turn
3 : you are red, correct?
2 : mmhmm
3 : ok
1 : yes
1 : i'm trying to think if i'll move first and flip or flip and then move
1 : cause
3 : is your special ability
4 : you could flip, move, and then flip again and get all four of them
1 : i can flip two
3 : yeah
1 : that's
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : no i can only
1 : can i do my special ability more than once?
3 : i think it should say it on your card, mine does.
4 : i'm pretty sure you can
1 : yeah, that's once action, you're right. so that is one action, so i skip over
1 : and then i can flip these two
3 : cool
2 : so that's two actions
1 : ok
1 : is that two actions?
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah, each of those is an action
2 : actually, no you moved so that's also three actions
4 : that'd be three right?
3 : oh right right right
1 : yeah, one, two, three. ok so three actions
1 : then i need two
1 : may i have two cards please?
2 : of course
1 : oh
1 : frick
1 : why don't we shovel the or shuffle these first
1 : ok so first thing we need to do is that, right?
2 : yup so one tenth
1 : and then discard that
1 : rip it up so don't get back into play
1 : ok and then and then
1 : there is nothing i can do with this so i gotta take
3 : yeah you shh
1 : wait
1 : should these have been like this?
2 : yeah they already started like that
3 : yeah, they just started like that
1 : oh ok ok umm
3 : i know you have to finish the water rise card
1 : yeah, i already did that didn't i already do that?
3 : we have to uh put those back on, don't we?
2 : so you
3 : yeah
2 : yeah, so shuffle them
1 : oh
1 : thank you
2 : and then put them back up here
3 : yup
1 : and then
3 : and then now you pick the uh the two
4 : and then draw two
1 : two
1 : ok, those two
3 : what are they called?
1 : uh the lost lagoon and ss cliffs of abandon
3 : again?
1 : what? didn't we just do that?
4 : yeah
3 : yeah, at least they're not gone
2 : yeah
1 : ok, is there anything else we need to do?
3 : uh i think that finishes your turn
1 : ok
1 : messenger
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : umm
1 : what's your ability?
2 : i can give cards to anyone
3 : ok
1 : do you want to give
2 : at any time
1 : oh, i'm sorry
4 : no it's fine
2 : i could
1 : given mine
2 : do you want, ok
1 : give me the
4 : we can do that
1 : fire
2 : sure
1 : ooo wait
2 : ok
1 : who's near the fire?
1 : ok i'm near the fire yeah
2 : yeah cause you're right
1 : give me the fire
2 : can't pick it up.
2 : here you go
2 : so then i can do one more thing. is there any point in me moving?
1 : where are you at?
2 : i'm right here
3 : umm
1 : i say
1 : how many moves did you do yet?
2 : that's two.
3 : two
1 : you already did two moves?
2 : mmhmm
1 : what was your first move?
4 : giving two cards.
3 : she gave a card to you
2 : yeah one card, one card
1 : isn't that her
1 : is that your
4 : that still counts as a
3 : nah, it's just the uh the card
3 : for her
3 : role.
4 : she can her thing is that she can give it to anybody, the rest of us, we have to be on the same spot.
3 : she gave you a card, and she gave
1 : oh ok
2 : mmhmm
1 : i would
1 : definitely get yourself centered
1 : well, i would think
2 : ok
4 : yeah, that makes sense
2 : anyone disagree with that?
3 : yeah
4 : no
2 : alright
1 : cause then at some point in time we could flip that card although?
4 : although
1 : go ahead
4 : it doesn't matter, never mind
1 : but you used all three of your turns?
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
1 : ok
2 : alright, so two treasure cards
2 : then i take two of these
1 : who's near those cuppy things?
4 : here and there
1 : ok
2 : alright, gold gate and temple of the moon
3 : yeah
2 : who's gold gate oh
3 : temple of the moon
3 : oh 
1 : there's no way we could've saved that
2 : sadness
3 : awesome, awesome
1 : i'm sorry what's the other one?
2 : ooo
4 : temple
2 : uh temple of the moon. this one.
1 : save me
2 : ok
2 : then i discard these
1 : ok
2 : actually
2 : the gold gate was the one that sunk?
3 : yeah, so that goes here
2 : ok
1 : ok
1 : so are you done with your three turns?
3 : 
2 : yeah
2 : so
1 : did you do that?
3 : yeah, she got those two
2 : mmhmm
1 : so we don't have to do this cause there was no flood card right?
2 : nope
1 : yay
3 : cool, it's my turn?
1 : your job to learn the rules
3 : i guess i can give you this?
3 : or
3 : oh wait
1 : ooo wait, w who's
4 : i just
3 : or maybe
4 : we're not in the same spot
1 : yeah, maybe he should start giving you this, cause you're close by, so actually on his turn
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : ok, so i'll keep this
3 : i mean
1 : ok
3 : i can
3 : i can unflood
3 : some of the cards
1 : d don't you have to be adjacent though?
3 : i'm allowed to well on one of my turns, i can just move wherever
3 : that's my power, i can move so i can just use one to move wherever
1 : oh
3 : and then unflood it
3 : er shore it up
2 : yeah
2 : so pilot, you're blue
3 : umm
1 : can you can't move diagonal though right?
3 : no
1 : ok
3 : i mean i guess technically i can cause i can move to any tile for one turn
3 : i don't think it's worth shoring up
3 : these three
3 : because they're already discarded
3 : and unless there's a water rise card,
3 : they're not going to be
3 : they're not going to sink anytime soon
1 : what's already discarded?
3 : these three. we just, we just sunk or we ju yeah sink? sunk? we sunk these
1 : so those cards aren't in play anymore?
3 : not until there's another water rise card
1 : yeah but if we want to risk it
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : yeah, probably not
1 : but then again, i can take care of these cause i'm here
3 : yeah, so is should i
3 : uh
1 : fly over there and then
3 : yeah
4 : i just don't know if is that really
3 : should i just go?
4 : do we need to save that?
1 : i think if we have no better move, then go ahead and just
1 : save em
3 : yeah
2 : i would prioritize those the ones with the uh treasures on them first
4 : yeah
1 : but that's what i'm saying. i can take care of these when my turn comes around. oh.
4 : but both of us still have to draw those cards and if we get another water rise card, then one of those could get sunk.
1 : that's right
3 : ok, you're right, you're right
1 : ok
3 : so should i, umm
3 : shore up the temple of the moon
1 : definitely
2 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : so i'll just move uh here i guess?
2 : wherever you want
3 : yeah and then cool
4 : yeah
4 : and just shore up the i guess
1 : ok so
1 : you've only done one
3 : uh yeah i
3 : that's one and then two
1 : yeah
3 : so i might as well shore this right?
4 : yeah
3 : while we're at it
1 : ooo
3 : ok
1 : do you have any turns left?
3 : uh no
2 : yeah that was the three
4 : no
1 : ok
3 : 
2 : so
3 : ok
2 : ok, you got a lot of helicopter cards
3 : and now two water rise cards
3 : it's uh breaker's bridge, phantom rock
3 : oh, there goes phantom rock
3 : umm
1 : it could have easily been any other card
3 : it's like everything that could go wrong is.
3 : breaker's bridge where is that?
4 : it's this one?
3 : ok
1 : oh i can take care of those on my turn.
3 : cool
3 : over there, thank you.
2 : mmhmm
1 : did the water
1 : no, water didn't rise.
4 : we just yeah
3 : yeah we're good, we're in the clear.
1 : ok
2 : not yet
4 : ok so my turn now.
2 : mmhmm
4 : umm
4 : what do you guys think?
1 : so what's your special ability again?
4 : i can move diagonally, like i can shore this one up right now.
4 : becau
3 : yeah
4 : i could get both of those really
4 : if we wanted to. or
3 : well you should give me
4 : i can
1 : well i my next turn i can easily flip those so if you have something else to do, i don't know. do we need to give oh you need to give your card to him.
4 : yeah
3 : uh you should give me that.
4 : ok
1 : why don't you give me that?
4 : where
3 : i think
1 : oh
3 : ye i can, on my turn
1 : ok
2 : only thing other thing you have to watch out for is that like you've got two treasures but you can only have five cards at a time.
1 : right, right, right.
2 : and you're gonna eventually need to collect four of each one.
1 : oo
4 : yeah you're next turn you're gonna have to discard something.
1 : no we have to
2 : or just like give it to someone else.
1 : pass these, yeah.
3 : or her actions can be to get rid of to pass them on to some of us.
4 : you could give yeah
1 : yeah we're definitely going to
4 : ok
3 : she can just give
1 : so in other words everybody has to sur sur s
3 : something
1 : save something.
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
1 : shit
2 : ideally
1 : i should've gave you these.
4 : it's alright.
2 : it's ok
4 : we're still, we're still ok
1 : ok well at least we got a plan
2 : live and learn.
1 : cause if you give him that
1 : no wait
4 : yeah
3 : then i've got five.
1 : no, oh no, if you give em to him
2 : mmhmm
1 : and then
1 : dumb how do i get that card back to me
1 : and these over to you?
3 : on your turn, you can pass those on.
2 : yeah
1 : and then you can give that to me.
3 : on my next turn, yeah.
1 : ok
1 : ok so anyways, what're we gonna do now?
4 : alright so
4 : i wanna give this to him right?
3 : uh huh
1 : yeah
4 : so i can move i mean i can take two turns and move to him
2 : so that's one.
4 : because i can move diagonally.
1 : ok
4 : and then i could
3 : would that wouldn't that
3 : oh wait, just move?
4 : well if that's, if that's what we're trying to do i can take
4 : two moves to get to you and then one to give you the card.
3 : oh right i forgot i reali yeah, yeah
1 : oh you have to be
1 : beside each other to give the card?
4 : yeah everyone the messenger can pass them to anybody yeah
2 : mmhmm
2 : except for me.
1 : i forgot about that, except for you
3 : yeah that's a i admit didn't think of that.
2 : i'm special.
1 : boy am i glad you guys know the rules.
4 : so if we need to like save like
1 : ok
4 : like we might wanna
4 : have you give
1 : i'm gonna give the fire to her
4 : a card to her
1 : yeah
4 : you all you really need is just one.
4 : just give one to her so that you don't have to discard a card
1 : right
2 : yeah
1 : right
4 : on your next turn and then she can give it right back to you if we need to.
1 : nah, cause i'm gonna start saving these. ok so anyways, go do your thing.
4 : alright, so that's what we're doing?
3 : yup
1 : yup
4 : alright two move
3 : that's two.
4 : pass
3 : three
4 : and then i draw two of those
3 : mmhmm
1 : don't flood
1 : oo
2 : then two of these
4 : and two of these
1 : what you workin on, yeah oo
4 : iron gate and whispering garden.
3 : iron gate
4 : whispering garden's this one
3 : ok
1 : ok and there was no flood cards.
1 : right?
4 : right
1 : ok
1 : so
1 : for the
1 : my free turn, and it doesn't count as anything right?
1 : my special ability doesn't count?
3 : uh no it should.
4 : i think it still counts as a turn, just so you can
3 : it counts as an action.
4 : you can save yeah it still counts as an action, but you can save two.
2 : yeah
1 : oh it does
2 : but you can do two at a time.
1 : ok
1 : so do i definitely wanna do these then?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah
2 : well
1 : oh
1 : wait.
4 : i think so
4 : but
1 : one two 
1 : cause if we got him
2 : hmm
1 : but if these
1 : yeah we need to do that first.
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : so that's one action
3 : mmhmm
1 : how many cards can i pass over?
3 : you could pass on
2 : one per action.
4 : one per action, but you're gonna have to move you're gonna have to take a turn to move.
3 : yeah
1 : where do i need to move to?
4 : well really you can only
4 : the only
4 : thing you can do is to move to us to pass, cause you can't move diagonally.
1 : oh that's right.
3 : so you
3 : you can move
3 : oh.
3 : you should move there and give him one.
1 : move
4 : yeah, you can move here and give me
4 : something.
3 : i would
3 : umm
1 : oh
1 : piss
1 : piss
1 : do i have to pick cause i always have to pick up cards from it right?
4 : yeah you're gonna have to take two.
4 : i mean
4 : discarding treasure cards i don't think is the worst thing in the world cause i think there's a lot of them.
2 : yeah, that's true.
3 : yeah for sure.
1 : ok
1 : ok
1 : so i have to move to be able to pass a card.
3 : yeah
4 : yeah
1 : but do i need to pass a card?
1 : i don't have anything else to do anyways though.
4 : yeah
1 : so is that my third move?
3 : that's your second move.
4 : that's your second move and then you can pass for your third move.
1 : that's my second move.
1 : umm
3 : so you should probably just pass one of these to him.
3 : cause i if i can't take anything
2 : yeah
1 : but he's doing the lions
1 : so i need to
1 : well let me give that to you.
3 : n no you can't, that's why. yeah
1 : oh i can't?
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : tell me what to do.
3 : i would give i would, i would still give one of these to him
3 : and then somehow, i'm not exactly sure how yet, we'll get the
3 : uh i forget what this was called, but these ones
1 : ok so we're gonna get you're gonna start collecting these?
3 : to her.
1 : oh and we're gonna give the lions to her?
4 : ok
3 : hopefully.
3 : uh it might take a while.
1 : no wait
1 : here
1 : give me that.
1 : umm i have one turn left, right?
4 : yeah
3 : yeah
4 : i mean you don't have, you don't have to use it but
1 : cause i'm thinking on her turn
1 : her turn, i know her turn she can give it over there
2 : mmhmm
1 : and that'll give you five. and but at least you'll have a set, cause if i give you something you're not gonna have a set.
4 : true
1 : 
1 : please, if you don't agree with this.
3 : no, no, no, i mean
4 : no that makes more sense uh i think if, if we can give, if we can get somebody three, then like that should their one that they're going after.
1 : ok
1 : you know what
3 : right
1 : i didn't even need to move then wait
1 : wait
1 : let's back up.
1 : so this was a turn to bring me over there right?
3 : mmhmm
1 : so instead of me moving over here
2 : mmhmm
1 : umm if i take one
4 : honestly you could just stay there
4 : and just not and just
1 : you know what, i'm gonna move here
4 : because on my next turn i can give you
4 : this cup
4 : and then you'll have three.
1 : where are these green cuppies at?
1 : there's one, where's the other green cuppy?
4 : over there
2 : there
1 : yeah, ok i am gonna take that turn there and then do i have one more turn?
4 : yeah
1 : ok
4 : but i would
4 : i'd just stay where you are
4 : because that way
1 : well the only reason why i was gonna move over there is cause if i need to flip two cards i can flip these two which are important to us.
1 : or that one which is important.
3 : right
4 : that's true.
3 : i can always fly someone too, we should keep that in mind, which doesn't count as an action.
1 : right
4 : i think it's good to be on the same spot.
4 : so like with the three of us there i feel
4 : just because we can pass easily between the three of us now.
1 : oh
3 : yeah we could
1 : but then it will take me two turns to get there where fromm here it will only take me one.
3 : well no but i can still move you
3 : when it comes around to my turn.
1 : oh that's right.
1 : ok
3 : or maybe you'll even get one now, who knows
1 : i still wanna move.
3 : but
4 : i don't know.
1 : i still wanna move
1 : god, yeah sorry
4 : it's up to you, it's your piece.
4 : go ahead, aight that's fine.
1 : ok, i'm done. nope, i need those two.
3 : yeah
4 : now you gotta draw two.
2 : oh you gotta get rid of one though.
1 : no
1 : not yet.
3 : she can pick, i think.
1 : oh piss
4 : so you don't have to discard now.
1 : yeah, but i'd rather
4 : we just move it up, yeah.
1 : ok
1 : and then
1 : this i can't do and then
1 : i need to take three of these?
1 : seriously
3 : well we have to well no we have to reshuffle those.
4 : we have to reshuffle, yeah
1 : oh that's right
1 : oh
1 : piss.
3 : which means
4 : this is gonna be really hard
4 : game
1 : well no as long as we're keeping track of the rules which
4 : yeah, just the flooding is gonna be hard to
1 : ok the iron gate,
2 : good bye
1 : the whispering garden,
2 : oh
4 :  we still have another one.
3 : yeah, makes sense. so we need those two cards
1 : and then the lost lagoon, oh
4 : the lost lagoon's right in front of you.
1 : somebody's keeping track of which cards are out of play, right?
1 : ok
1 : your turn
4 : alright
1 : messenger.
2 : ok so do we deci decide i'm giving this to you?
1 : definitely.
1 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : alright, so you're gonna eventually need to get your way down here.
4 : yeah
1 : or where's the other one?
2 : umm
3 : i can always fly and now we just lost that one.
1 : yeah
3 : but i can fly you anytime any turn, so that's not a big deal.
1 : i told you
1 : to pay attention to that son of a bitch.
1 : sorry
3 : uh
4 : you can
1 : aw she could've sand bagged anytime.
1 : forgot about that.
3 : yeah, we should keep these in mind.
1 : ok where are you at? you're here.
3 : uh
2 : mmhmm
1 : umm
1 : and you're not collecting anything. we gotta get you collecting something.
2 : do you want me to move closer to you guys so it's a little easier? which card would be easiest?
1 : probably.
3 : hmm?
1 : that way you're kinda center
2 : see those
2 : one
2 : and then
3 : oh you uh ok
2 : like there
3 : so that's your second?
2 : yeah. i can move one more if i need to, but if not
4 : i'd yeah, i'd maybe just stay there
3 : she could always move to
3 : this one
2 : temple of the moon
3 : that way
3 : if need be, she'll be on it or she could move to us if she has to.
1 : yeah but you're gonna collect them so it's irrelevant for her to be there.
4 : but just to
3 : but if she needs
3 : added
4 : to shore it up.
1 : oh i see
4 : cause the cards that are on top are like
1 : ok
4 : this one, this one
1 : right
4 : i don't know. i know there's a big
4 : cluster of them right in there
3 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
1 : right
4 : so, ok
1 : so wait a minute
1 : so one,
1 : two,
3 : that was her third
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : ok and you can't flip anything cause you can't flip diagonal
3 : so
2 : k so
2 : two of these
2 : alright
1 : oh so we have to stay together
2 : and then one, two
1 : ok
1 : so i'm gonna collect the cups, you're gonna collect these
2 : three
2 : ok keep in mind now i have two sandbags, so we can make use of that
1 : how many of these do you need?
4 : just four, so we can get that one now
1 : don't sink anything
4 : yeah
1 : cause you need to start working your way down there now.
2 : alright
4 : there well i can get there on my turn
1 : yay! oh that's right you can do the diagonal
4 : and then she can
1 : ah one, two, ah
1 : life is good
4 : alright, which one  the bridge?
1 : whose turn is it?
2 : alright so breaker's bridge, cliffs of abandon, which is this one
4 : so that's where we are
1 : dammit
1 : we couldn't remember
2 : umm
2 : and temple of the moon which i'm standing on
1 : what is it with these cards?
1 : it's always
4 : at least they're all at least at least they're all close to each other that makes our job easier.
1 : i feel like i have to stay there
2 : yeah
1 : feel like i have to stay there
2 : alright
2 : i'm gonna
2 : should i use a sandbag and shore up this so that we don't have to worry about it going away?
3 : you could, or you could hold onto it
4 : umm
2 : should i hold onto it?
3 : cause you
1 : cause you can play them anytime right?
3 : yeah so if, and like technically we're we might not see that again
1 : oh wait, no, no, no, no, no, no
2 : the only thing is if you draw a flood card
1 : right, it's gone
2 : and then
1 : flip
4 : yeah it b yeah
2 : then it
2 : it goes away right away.
4 : that's probably smart.
2 : so i'll just do this now
3 : oh so there, are there
3 : there repeats
3 : in that deck?
4 : for
1 : ok so
2 : there should
1 : is that f is that first turn?
2 : be
4 : which deck?
3 : in that
4 : the flood cards?
3 : yeah, you
4 : no there's only one but
4 : the one's that we've drawn continue to get added to the top so
1 : yeah
4 : like those are the ones that are gonna get pulled up
3 : right

3 : mm
4 : alright so my turn
4 : and i take the treasure
4 : for one
1 : 
4 : umm
1 : you can move diagonal right?
4 : then
4 : yeah and then i'll just move to fool's landing i guess
4 : or
1 : ok
4 : should i just i should probably save this right?
1 : yeah i would definitely save that one
4 : ok so
3 : well
2 : so that's
3 : why?
1 : because if we lose this
2 : but i also have a sandbag card
1 : when he pulls cards
1 : but you can't
3 : no she can use that now
4 : oh ok
3 : right? 
2 : i can use it whenever
3 : you might as well just save it
2 : ok
3 : now and save his action
1 : yeah that's what i would say so i would move that
4 : well it reall
4 : i mean can everybody make it back this turn?
4 : and we can win
3 : yeah
3 : i mean i think
1 : you can't move diagonal, can you?
4 : well i can, so i can get i can get back right now
2 : he can that's his special power
3 : i would do that
4 : you can get back next turn
1 : uh ok

1 : if for some god forsaken reason you pull these two cards
1 : you cannot get back
1 : we need to save that lands
1 : from traveling
3 : who can't get back?
1 : these guys
3 : i can, i will be able to
2 : well i have a
1 : ok
2 : and then i have this so i can save it
1 : it's up to you, just letting you know
4 : the only my only question is, can you use the sandbag out of turn?
3 : it should say it right now, it should say it
2 : yeah
3 : play anytime
2 : i mean it's a special action time
1 : but there's sometime the that you can't use it, i think when the flood
1 : card, yeah it's the flood cards.
3 : it says
4 : well it's after, if it's already sunk you can't use it but, if you can use it right now, use it right now
1 : right
3 : it says play any time
2 : alright, so let's do it
4 : alright
4 : yeah
4 : and then i'll move back
