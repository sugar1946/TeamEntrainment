1 : 
1 : so apparently
2 : so
1 : ok
1 : can i have two of those
2 : yup
1 : so i have the water rise
1 : and the
1 : the fire
1 : and then i'm gonna shore up
2 : 
2 : you gotta draw
1 : oh yeah
1 : umm
2 : you have to shuffle it and then put it on top.
1 : right
2 : because you have two of these
2 : er
3 : oh yeah
3 : you should shore up the one that you're on
1 : oh yeah
2 : 
1 : do i have to put that back?
1 : ok
2 : so that's one action right?
1 : that so like from before.
2 : oh
1 : ok
1 : so that's
1 : three right?
1 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : so
3 : and then did you draw two?
1 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : no i mean like the
2 : well you have to put that
2 : in there.
3 : w
1 : oh
3 : we have to put this back
1 : wait
2 : alright, and you have to draw two
1 : so the phantom rock and the lost lagoon
1 : so then
3 : so they both sink
1 : yeah
3 : thanks
2 : alright
2 : ah
2 : umm
2 : go here for the second one and then shore it up for the third action.
3 : i think you can just be like
3 : adjacent to it, i don't think you need to
3 : yeah you don't need to be on it in order to shore up
2 : oh
3 : so you can stay on the one with the engineer
3 : if you want to
2 : what was i before?
1 : here
2 : oh
2 : i'll take this
2 : two actions right?
1 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
2 : alright
2 : two
2 : and then two of these
2 : 
1 : yeah
2 : this is flooded.
3 : thanks
2 : and then the cliffs of abandon
2 : shores it
3 : what is it called cliffs?
2 : cliffs oh it's right here.
2 : oh it's
3 : this one sank
1 : that was sunk
2 : oh yeah
3 : ok
3 : mm
3 : i guess i can use my special power to fly over here and like
3 : from that
1 : yeah
2 : here?
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : and then shore this up
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah and then shore up
2 : isn't that four actions?
3 : nnhmm
2 : cause
1 : mm
2 : you moved once and then you shored it up and then you flew which is a third.
3 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : no i don't think it counts if
1 : no no she-you can do it adjacently i think
3 : this
1 : no
3 : does one of your action
3 : if
3 : oh you're right i did
2 : yeah so you can't. ok
3 : ok never mind so i'll stay here.
3 : umm
3 : what else can i do?
3 : and then give the treasure card, ok
2 : but you have to be
3 : that wouldn't be, that wouldn't be helpful.
2 : yeah
3 : and on the same, ok i'll just draw these
2 : you have to be on the same tile
2 : ok
3 : and then
2 : alright
2 : so you should try to
3 : i need two flood cards
1 : huh
2 : get to here?
2 : and then you should also go there and then she'll give you that.
2 : and you'll have three and hopefully we can draw one by that time.
1 : yeah
3 : and gold gate and temple of the moon
1 : ok
2 : temple of the moon. where is it? oh
1 : so
2 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : i'm gonna shore this up
1 : and then
2 : right here so move two over there yeah.
1 : i'm gonna move yeah
1 : sweet
1 : ok
1 : and we have the whisepering gar, garden and the iron gate
1 : yeah
2 : uh oh
2 : oh
3 : i mean i don't think you need to do that yet
1 : ah ok
2 : yeah it's only after the water's rise
1 : oh
2 : alright so
2 : alright
2 : i have two of these so
2 : i'll go
2 : one, two
2 : and then
2 : i'll shore this up
2 : for my third.
2 : 
1 : ok
2 : this counts as a card, right?
2 : so this would be four. ok.
3 : as a move?
3 : yeah yeah
2 : so draw two
2 : and then i have to use this immediately.
1 : mmhmm
2 : and then this goes over
3 : and then you have to discard one
2 : but i have five now cause i have to use that immediately.
3 : oh yeah that's not a car oh yeah
3 : ok cool
2 : so three
1 : and then
2 : oh there
2 : 
2 : so iron gate.
2 : the whispering garden ok
1 : two
2 : and that pulls 
3 : thanks
1 : ok
3 : ok so
3 : i have two helicopter lift things.
3 : so i'm gonna get us all
3 : to here
2 : or just you two.
3 : i'm gonna
1 : yeah
3 : get the two of us to here.
1 : mmhmm
2 : yup
3 : one of my action, my second actions will be to give you this.
2 : that doesn't count as an action
1 : ok
3 : are you sure?
2 : yeah
2 : so that would be one.
3 : oh ok
1 : uh
3 : then
1 : ok and then i've
3 : should i also move you here so that we can
2 : huh?
3 : i'm gonna, i'm going to move, i'm going to use my other helicopter lift card to move the messenger to this island as well so that
3 : when it's the engineer's turn.
3 : she can get the treasure.
2 : do all of us have to be on it to get the treasure? oh ok.
3 : is that ok?
2 : yup
3 : ok
3 : i think we all have to be on it together.
2 : do we? 
3 : i believe so.
1 : nnhmm
3 : capture treasure.
2 : it only says if your pawn.
2 : so i don't think all three of us should be on it.
3 : i'm pretty sure that we all have to be on it.
3 : to get it
1 : mm
3 : where does it say if your pawn?
2 : on the side thing.
2 : at the bottom.
3 : capture a treasure.
3 : oh if your pawn is on it.
1 : both of you
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : oh ok alright then. i'll move you back.
2 : alright so
3 : but i need to move you anyway.
1 : yeah
1 : so that works
3 : so that we can do
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : and then i guess i can use my special power.
3 : to
3 : fly here and flood this up.
3 : or shore this up.
1 : yeah
2 : yup
3 : ok
3 : and that's i think all my turns.
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : and then i'll draw
2 : yup
1 : ok
3 : ok
3 : temple of the sun
3 : cliffs of abandon
1 : cliffs
1 : lots
3 : that's for you
1 : oh wow
2 : oh
3 : and crimson forest
1 : ok
3 : ok
1 : ok so i have six cards and i have to get rid of one.
2 : oh you gotta
2 : get rid of umm
2 : uh
1 : i'm gonna get rid of that.
3 : oh
1 : earth yeah
2 : yikes yeah
3 : it doesn't matter i mean six one 
1 : so
1 : ok
1 : and then
1 : i'm gonna get the treasure
2 : yup
1 : then i'm gonna
1 : shore up
1 : this guy
2 : you have to be next to it though.
1 : oh
1 : or
2 : so
1 : does the engineer have to be next to it?
2 : you have to be
3 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : i think so.
3 : wait what's your special power.
2 : wait you were here right?
1 : i shore up two tiles for one action.
3 : she's right here.
3 : think you still have to be next to them.
2 : that's cool.
2 : so you have to move here and then shore it up.
1 : ok so i'll move yeah.
1 : oh that's
3 : be
3 : yeah he
3 : yeah you can do it.
2 : you can shore it up. yeah, that's the third action.
1 : is that ok?
1 : alright
2 : oh yeah you can shore up two right?
1 : mmhmm
1 : thanks
1 : ok
1 : so i lift the copper gate
1 : umm
1 : there we go the
1 : tidal palace
2 : k
1 : and then the silver gate
3 : oh ok
3 : so i think that our strategy should be
3 : to make sure that
3 : like the palaces and the gardens and like anywhere that we can
2 : yeah
3 : get things from
3 : we don't let them sink.
1 : mm
2 : alright
2 : umm then let's use this right away.
1 : would it matter? so yeah we don't need that one.
3 : well we already have that one.
2 : oh
2 : oh yeah
3 : so you can use that for a different one. cause i guess this doesn't i would use that for that one.
2 : alright
2 : yeah that one.
1 : yeah
2 : so i have two.
2 : alright
2 : ok
2 : alright, i'll just shore this one up.
2 : well no wait, i'm the gray one, so i'll go here
1 : mmhmm
2 : and then i'll shore this up.
3 : ok
2 : and then you can give me this one next turn and then that one. alright.
3 : mmhmm, that's yeah
1 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : and
2 : these two
2 : it's five
2 : but this thing again
2 : so what was up?
2 : 
2 : do this first
2 : then draw three
2 : so cliffs of abandon this
2 : so whispersing garden
2 : and then temple of the moon. where is it? this one
3 : alright my first action
3 : shore up
3 : second action i'll give you
2 : me, cause i have two
3 : you you yeah sorry
1 : oh yeah yeah yeah
2 : and then i'll throw away this one.
3 : cool
1 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : third action
3 : i'll f i'll use my special power to fly here and
1 : oh
2 : that's the third you can't
2 : shore it up
3 : oh
1 : ok
3 : ok well
2 : 
2 : and then these two
3 : yeah oh wait i have a sandbag thing, so
2 : oh yeah
1 : oh cool
3 : i'll shore this up
3 : but i can stay here
3 : cause like it's like anything on the table
1 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : so that would still be three moves
1 : ok
3 : helicopter
3 : another one of what is this? the stone of
3 : enlightenment, what is this called? the earth stone
1 : earth
2 : stone of enlightenment
3 : silver gate, crimson forest and the temple of the sun

1 : ok
2 : those too and then shore, not we already had that
1 : two
1 : one
1 : we have that yet?
3 : yeah we don't.
1 : so
3 : does it matter?

2 : yeah
1 : y yeah
2 : mm

1 : so i have
1 : these guys
1 : ok we have the tidal palace

2 : embers
2 : bronze gate
2 : oh
3 : and cave of shadows

2 : we all got out here though.
3 : oh yeah
2 : so
1 : so
3 : two
2 : i don't think you have to shore it up though cause it's gonna fall anyway
1 : oh really?
1 : ok
2 : well i mean, we already have it though, so
3 : right so you might as well like not use a move then.
1 : alright
1 : ok

1 : yeah so we have the temple of the moon, the crimson forest and the cave of embers.
2 : uh
1 : ah which one was that one?
3 : cave of embers
2 : alright, so
3 : so move to the twilight hollow.

1 : nnhmm
2 : i can't?
1 : one, two
2 : one, two, three
