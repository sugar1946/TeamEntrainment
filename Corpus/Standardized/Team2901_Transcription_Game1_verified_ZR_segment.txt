1 : umm
1 : i'm thinking
1 : should probably
1 : umm
1 : unflood
1 : two of the tiles
1 : umm
1 : prob
2 : probably do the one that has the thing on it
1 : mmhmm
1 : so i'll do whispering garden
1 : and gold gate
1 : so that's one action
1 : and i have fire cards so i think i'm gonna start moving that way
2 : i think you're allowed only allowed to shore up one
1 : oh i have to be adjacent to it
1 : ok
2 : can you do two?
2 : or
3 : she can
2 : oh, ok
3 : because she's the engineer
1 : i can. i just have to be
2 : oh, you can. alright.
3 : it's just the matter of the cards that she
3 : shores up need to be next to her
2 : yeah
1 : adjacent, ok
1 : i'll do that then
1 : and then
1 : can move
1 : say i wanna get down there
1 : so probably move
1 : this way and then
1 : i have one more action so
1 : this way
1 : guess i'll go
1 : umm
1 : give me two treasure deck cards please?
1 : ok
1 : umm so a water's rise card
1 : and
1 : put that over there, please
1 : and then flood cards
1 : oops
1 : so
1 : go over there
1 : and whispering garden
2 : so
2 : i guess i'll start
2 : by
2 : shoring up
2 : move here first
2 : and then i can
2 : no wait, never mind. i'll just do that
2 : uh
2 : see
2 : uh
2 : i guess i'll move here
2 : uh
2 : i don't
2 : have anything else to do
2 : i suppose
3 : you have to do flood cards
3 : or treasure cards and flood cards, do both
2 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
2 : another one of those
2 : and
2 : i can shore up
2 : uh
2 : i don't know. i guess i can save that.
2 : but
1 : ok
2 : umm
3 : you should shore you should shore up that one before you have to flood it.
2 : where is that?
1 : cities of abandon
2 : which one? the cities of abandon?
3 : the cliffs, yeah.
2 : oh ok.
2 : cliffs, yeah
2 : so then this goes here
1 : i don't think you can do that because this card, like, it was drawn so i think you would've had to do that before
3 : oh i didn't know if you could do that
2 : oh so it's just
2 : done
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : ok
2 : sure
2 : so that's out
2 : and
2 : i'll just go here
1 : mmhmm
2 : ok
2 : that's it
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : i will just move
3 : and
3 : with my thing i can
3 : go to any tile so it's not just so
2 : yeah
1 : mm
3 : i know that i have one here so i'll just hang out here for a bit
3 : to accumulate them
1 : i was thinking maybe you should
3 : or, yeah
1 : go here
1 : and then you could flip
3 : oh ok, yeah
1 : that for one of your actions
3 : could do that
3 : umm
1 : or, like, the watchtower
3 : yeah
2 : because you can
1 : because if you go down to the watchtower
2 : then you can flip an adjacent one
2 : you mean?
1 : mmhmm
3 : oh, yeah, yeah. that's fine
2 : and then you could still be there closely
1 : yeah
3 : sure
3 : ok
3 : uh
3 : right
3 : and that's
3 : two
3 : alright so more helicoptors
3 : and that
3 : umm
3 : and then flood
1 : flood cards
3 : so we have
3 : oh, good thinking
3 : and
3 : rock
3 : pretty much. oh, we already, so this one's out
2 : what does it mean when they have these little pieces on them?
1 : i think that's just where we started
3 : yeah, i think it's the starting point
2 : oh, oh
1 : like the pawn start
3 : and so this goes back
1 : mmhmm
1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : so
1 : i should
1 : probably get down
1 : to the
2 : yeah
1 : cave of shadows
1 : because i can't
1 : umm
1 : shore up anything, really
1 : umm
2 : can you
3 : i can use the helicopter
3 : to get you there
1 : oh later
3 : right
3 : isn't it
1 : is that what you mean?
3 : or now
2 : can you give her this or is that only something that i can do?
1 : no she can but it has to be on her turn
2 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : so i guess
3 : yeah like, like i
3 : if you wanted to get there i can give this to you on my turn
1 : ok
1 : well i was just thinking for like my one turn i could give
1 : her the
1 : chalice
2 : chalice
3 : ok
1 : or, wait, where's the
1 : the one
3 : purple is either above or below
1 : hmm
1 : ok so i guess it's close so i was gonna say because the fire's here and the chalice so i can
3 : mmhmm
1 : give this to you
1 : and then
2 : and what are you, are you going to move to here then? and she can give you that on her turn?
1 : mmhmm
2 : oh ok
1 : yep
2 : give a single card to another player
1 : oh who is standing on the same tile as you. ok, never mind.
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : oh, i have a trip to get there
1 : ok
1 : ok
2 : if
1 : what color are, is this you?
2 : that were the case
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : ok so
1 : then maybe on
1 : your turn
1 : you can fly down and then
1 : can you, like
1 : give card
2 : i can
2 : me? i can give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card
2 : which i don't know what that means. one action per card
1 : yeah
3 : so it's just like a one to one thing. like one of your actions will be doing that exchange
2 : ok
2 : so that's an action
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : ok
3 : wait so you're trying to get to here. you can just
3 : go here
1 : yeah i was gonna give her a tile. i was just thinking
3 : oh ok
1 : the best way to do
1 : i'll just go
1 : because
1 : you have
1 : a card that i need and which, this is you right?
3 : yeah, so i could, yeah
1 : ok
1 : come over and do that. so i'll do that and then
3 : i can, yeah
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, i guess we'll just do that
1 : does that sound good? cause there's really no point in me doing anything else
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah, i agree
3 : yep
3 : that's fine
1 : ok
2 : oh diag nice
1 : oh
1 : great
3 : here we go
2 : oh
3 : yeah, i know right
2 : next two turns
1 : ok, temple of the moon, oh
1 : iron gate
2 : that's gold
2 : oh, iron gate
3 : ok
3 : at least it's on the periphery
2 : ok
1 : ok
3 : alright
2 : alight, yeah
2 : so, now
2 : i'm like so far away
2 : and, i mean i guess i can
1 : ee
2 : if i p can move up there then i can flip that back over, like eventually
3 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
3 : you just might need to take like
2 : umm
3 : two or three turns to do that
2 : yeah
2 : cause i can only move once at a time
1 : ok
1 : ok, maybe you could
1 : give the
1 : chalice to me because i'll be
1 : close here
3 : mmhmm
2 : if the next one like
2 : comes up, you mean?
3 : but you
3 : but again, you have to be on the same tile to give the cards, remember?
2 : oh right
3 : or no you do, you don't, you don't have to right
2 : no but i can give it to anyone
1 : oh
2 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok
1 : so we could do that, and then
1 : we should probably because we're gonna have to
2 : i mean i'm gonna have to start moving anyway. it might as well be sooner rather than later because i'm stuck here like
3 : mmhmm
3 : and you can only, yeah
1 : mmhmm
1 : oh, so i have to discard one, ok
2 : oh you have to discard
2 : woo
2 : you can discard that one because you don't have anything accumulated
3 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
2 : where does that go?
3 : it goes in the treasure pile
2 : ok
1 : treasure pile
3 : thank you
2 : do these never come back though?
3 : if we like run through the deck i think we'll reshuffle it or something but yeah
2 : ok, also it doesn't matter because you have treasure cards anyway
1 : ok
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : yeah, cause i'm cornered
3 : mmhmm
2 : so i have to
3 : yeah and remember this is a diagonal. you can't move diagonally
2 : start
2 : right, i have to start moving anyway
3 : so
3 : yeah
2 : so that's one
1 : so that's one
2 : that was two
1 : you have
2 : and then, i can
1 : up to three
2 : i don't have anything else to do, i suppose
1 : maybe you could use the sandbag card to save this just in case we have to
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
2 : because
3 : i think that would be really wise
2 : it has a thing on it, ok
1 : yeah, shuffle and it comes up again
3 : and that's why, you're going toward that anyway, yeah
2 : good idea
3 : so
2 : ok
2 : ok, cool
3 : alright, so treasures and water
2 : ok, water's rise
3 : uh
2 : oh
2 : what do i do  and put these on top?
2 : and
1 : mm
3 : and then you have to draw three of them, yeah
2 : and i have to pick three
1 : three
2 : ok
2 : so this
2 : didn't do anything
3 : mm
2 : but i guess it did, because it would have been sunk
1 : right
3 : yeah, that's tru
2 : umm
2 : iron gate
1 : iron gate is sunk
3 : iron gate just goes away
3 : oh give me the card
2 : done
3 : for the
3 : iron gate, yeah
2 : oh, my bad, yeah
1 : mm
2 : and the gold gate
1 : golden gate is sunk
2 : alright
2 : and this goes
1 : mmhmm
2 : this is mine? alright
3 : ok
3 : so umm, you needed or someone needed to be lifted
3 : who was that?
3 : no
1 : i don't think we're gonna do that. i think you were gonna give me the fire card
3 : not anymore, yeah
3 : yeah
1 : as one
2 : ok
2 : great
1 : right and then
3 : and well, i, i needed to be over here to do that
2 : you have to discard one
1 : ok
3 : here i needed to be over here to do that, too, but here
3 : 
2 : give a single card to another player standing on the same
3 : yep
1 : oh same
3 : i just, i just moved
1 : oh ok
3 : so that's fine
2 : ok, but you still have to discard
1 : and then
1 : yeah
1 : get rid of that
3 : umm, let's see
2 : uh
3 : really
3 : do you need to go anywhere?
2 : is there anything that you can do?
2 : i mean
3 : cause i already have another one of these cards, i guess
3 : umm
2 : like i only have two of these right now anyway so
3 : mmhmm
2 : i don't think that that would help much
1 : yeah because like on your next turn even you could just move over and then
2 : yeah, like, might as well save those if you need em so you could just continue with
1 : unsink it
3 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : cool
3 : alright
3 : uh
2 : picking i guess
3 : i think that's all i need to
1 : treasure cards
3 : do in this round
3 : so i've got
3 : this. i think that's six
3 : so i will
2 : well
3 : discard one of the heli
3 : cause it's just two of em
2 : yeah
3 : umm and then
3 : floods
3 : so three
3 : alright so we have
3 : where's
3 : howling garden
3 : lost lagoon
1 : it sunk
3 : ok
3 : and whispering garden
2 : ok
3 : ok
3 : these go back
1 : ok
1 : so i wanna get
1 : treasure first. i can just do that
2 : you need to trade em
3 : yeah
1 : right now
2 : mmhmm
3 : these cards just go back in the pile i guess
1 : and i just take this
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : umm
2 : ok
1 : and then
1 : i can move over and then unsink that
2 : so you're here
1 : think i'll just do that
1 : then
1 : oops, can you flip that please?
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
1 : umm can you hand me a treasure card?
1 : ok
1 : umm and then
1 : flood cards
2 : right so we have four of these up now
2 : so
2 : i guess
2 : on
2 : your guys's next turns see
3 : we need to consolidate
2 : give em to me and
3 : yeah
1 : mm
2 : then you could
2 : maybe
2 :  i mean
2 : maybe on your next turn you could first fly me to like one of the oh, well i guess that's right there but
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : so i'll, i'll move here next and then i can move there and collect it
1 : because we're gonna have to
3 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : yeah we're going to have to un
1 : flip this too, at some point
2 : yeah, and that one
3 : and, and that. yeah
1 : mmhmm
3 : i mean i can use a sandbags to do that so
2 : and you have sandbags
1 : ok, where's crimson f
1 : forest is up there
3 : ok
1 : crimson forest, copper gate
1 : and cave of embers
1 : which isn't really important
2 : ok
2 : good
1 : mmhmm
3 : ok
2 : so i'm moving here
2 : umm
2 : i guess i'm
2 : gonna shore up this
3 : mmhmm
1 : oh wait
1 : before you do that
2 : yeah
1 : maybe you should like, shore up this one and then move over and then shore up
1 : or did you, were you going to do something else?
2 : can i do that?
3 : wait, i think you, like one move is like one
1 : i think so
3 : actions so you can only do three actions, right?
1 : yeah, cause like
2 : so i can, this would become my first
1 : flipping that would be one
1 : and then over
2 : two
3 : mm
3 : three
2 : three
1 : three
3 : ok
2 : ok
2 : that was good
2 : uh
1 : yeah
2 : now
2 : ok
2 : so
2 : waters rise
2 : that's not really
3 : and then
1 : three flood cards
2 : important
2 : not anymore
2 : ok, so we have copper gate sunk
3 : that's done
2 : whispering garden
2 : done
2 : howling garden
2 : cool
3 : can you give me the copper gate card?
2 : so, it's your turn
3 : ok
3 : umm
2 : so now you wanna give me one of these
3 : did
3 : yes
1 : so you have to fly to her
2 : oh right
1 : right?
3 : oh
3 : yeah
2 : does shh
1 : you have to be on the same
2 : does she has to be on the same?
1 : or is your special power?
3 : or
1 : you can give them to anyone
1 : one
2 : no, that's mine
1 : ok
2 : you're right. so she's gotta
2 : fly to me
3 : ok, so i have to go here
3 : or, yeah here
3 : and then give you this
2 : is that
1 : give that to you
2 : of an action for you
3 : umm
2 : to fly anywhere?
3 : yes it is an action. so that's one, two
2 : ok
2 : so that's two
1 : two
3 : and then
3 : three is
2 : umm
1 : you should
3 : yeah
2 : you can't flip over a diagonal, can you? you can't shore up a diagonal?
3 : i can use sand
1 : oh
3 : umm
3 : but this is any one, any tile is is, for sandbags so
2 : oh
1 : yeah, maye you should
1 : shore up
1 : either this one or that one
2 : yeah, either or
1 : but
1 : i'm thinking this one is kind of
1 : going to be iso
2 : i was just about to say the same thing. i think you should do this one
1 : it's
1 : yeah, isolated
3 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
2 : cause we've gotta keep these guys in play anyway
3 : ok
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm yeah, fool's landing
3 : alright so there's my three
2 : cool
3 : more helicopters
1 : did you discard sandbag?
3 : uh
3 : yes
1 : ok
3 : umm
1 : and
3 : and then three
2 : alright
2 : so
3 : cave is done
1 : ok, that's ok
3 : we've already got that one
3 : and forest, where's the crimson forest?
3 : ah, crimson is also done
3 : ok
2 : oh so we're
2 : stranded, basically
3 : little bit
1 : you can fly someone else with you, right?
3 : yes
2 : yeah, cause, especially cause, yeah
1 : ok
1 : as long as you're on
2 : on the same
1 : ok
2 : yeah
1 : umm
1 : so
3 : just this
3 : can't sink
2 : so you need to give me this
1 : ok
1 : oh
2 : as one of em
2 : oh well you can shore up the temple right now
1 : no i have to be adjacent to it
1 : i can
2 : aren't you, oh you're red. oh, my bad. i thought you were blue
1 : shore up two, yeah
3 : yeah, she's red. yeah
3 : yeah
1 : i can't give that to you because
2 : ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : i have to like
2 : yeah
1 : be up with you
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
2 : well
1 : umm
2 : oh, and she can't fly
2 : umm
1 : is there anything
2 : shoot
1 : umm i'll probably
1 : just like move on to the
1 : coral palace so i'm
1 : there
1 : i think
2 : can you move diagonal?
1 : yeah, well just like one, two
2 : oh
1 : and
2 : i thought you could only do one space, though
1 : i think, isn't it?
2 : one space per action
1 : yeah so that would be two actions
2 : ok
3 : you just moved up, two actions, yeah
2 : yeah
1 : and
1 : i can only shore up adjacent, i can't shore up diagonal.
1 : so i think that's probably
2 : oh diag
1 : oh great.
2 : that was
1 : look at that.
2 : cool
3 : cool
3 : can you just get that now or is that one of your actions to get the treasure? yeah, ok.
2 : that's another action.
1 : yeah that's an
1 : i have to wait till
3 : well yeah, now you know. next
1 : next
1 : hopefully.
1 : oh boy
1 : ok
1 : coral palace
3 : oh
3 : mm
1 : dune of deception
1 : and silver gate.
3 : ok
3 : umm
2 : ok
1 : it's your turn
3 : yeah
2 : so
2 : it's my turn.
2 : umm, why not shore up this.
1 : mm good call
3 : yes
3 : umm
2 : and i'm well i don't really
2 : let me think
2 : i don't have to be on that tile to collect the treasure there, do i?
3 : i think you do, yeah.
1 : yeah
2 : ok, so i might as well move.
3 : yep
2 : and
2 : uh
3 : and i'll move with you on my turn so we can helicopter out.
3 : at some point
2 : yeah
3 : cause we can't go.
2 : is there any reason that we need to like
2 : keep the silver gate?
1 : no because you're
3 : uh
2 : 
3 : yeah
1 : stranded anyway.
2 : yeah because that's an island.
3 : yeah
1 : well i was thinking
2 : well who can move diagonal?
3 : no one?
2 : oh
1 : none of us no
2 : cause we're not that guy.
3 : we're not playing the explorer, yeah.
1 : wait because on your turn
1 : oh wait
3 : on my turn we're gonna go somewhere else.
1 : never mind
1 : yeah i was gonna say
1 : because i have to
1 : give her this card at some point.
2 : yeah so on her turn she needs to fly you
2 : to me
1 : but i have to be here to get
1 : that.
1 : so unless
2 : oh
1 : on your turn you could fly
3 : everyone to the chalice thing?
2 : no cause we're on, on different places.
1 : you could fly to get
3 : oh
1 : oh wait, no
1 : because that would be one,
3 : what i could do is i could move me one
1 : two,
3 : fly over
1 : three.
3 : yeah
1 : because you could fly to me, take me there, and then take me
3 : mmhmm
1 : back.
2 : take all of us back, you mean.
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
3 : yup, yup, that could work.
2 : ok
1 : well no you would have to stay there.
2 : she well she could move here
3 : mmhmm
2 : well wait how am i getting the thing then?
1 : yeah i was gonna say like she could come down, get me, take me up
3 : yeah
1 : so i can give you this card
1 : and then
1 : take me back so i can get the
2 : but can't you just give me that card on your turn ah but then your turn will be next but then she couldn't
1 : coral palace.
2 : fly you back, becausse can't you only give me
3 : mm
2 : that card when it's your turn?
1 : no we have to be on the same
3 : mmhmm
1 : tile.
3 : you can give cards anywhere on your turn but she can't give to you.
2 : yeah but like
2 : yeah but like i'm saying don't you have to wait to give me
2 : that card until it's your turn, or can you give it at
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
2 : so like
3 : yeah
1 : no
2 : she's gonna fly you
1 : oh, i see what you're saying.
2 : here and then you're not gonna be able to do anything.
3 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok, yeah we'll just have to wait then, so you can get that, because it's gonna sink.
2 : so the only thing that we can do is just keep em from sinking until we go around again.
1 : mmhmm
2 : so
3 : yup
3 : can you shore up the tile you're on, not just an adjacent one, or
3 : ok
1 : i think you can shore up the tile you're on.
2 : yeah you can.
2 : so
3 : that might be a good
2 : yeah
2 : so
2 : your next turn, you're gonna give
2 : me that
1 : i'm
2 : and then it'll be
2 : your
2 : and then i can
2 : get it and then
2 : her turn will be again and then you could
2 : we could get you for  that
3 : well on her turn she can also do this. if she gives you that card she can also get the treasure on her turn.
2 : mmhmm
3 : so she doesn't need to stay on this tile, necessarily.
1 : no i can
1 : shore it up
3 : yeah
1 : and then yeah, because then
2 : and then oh cause you
2 : and get it.
2 : i see.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : so
2 : do you first
1 : yeah
2 : because you're already there, you're like primed.
1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : it's still your turn right?
2 : cool, yes.
1 : ok
3 : mmhmm
2 : it's still my turn but i'm not doing anything more, i'm just gonna do this.
1 : yeah
3 : yup
2 : ok
1 : ok
1 : and
1 : get rid of the
1 : chalice, cause you can only have five, yeah.
2 : oh yeah, cause you already have four.
3 : mmhmm yeah
2 : alright
1 : and then
1 : water tiles.
2 : temple of the sun,
2 : tidal palace,
2 : bronze gate.
1 : let's see here.
2 : that wasn't so bad,
2 : i suppose.
1 : ok
1 : though i'm going
1 : to just go ahead and get the chalice
2 : wait, it's her turn
1 : oh sorry
3 : oh i do need to 
1 : i thought we were going this way.
3 : umm so i can move up here so we can helicopter
3 : umm that's the only thing i know for sure.
1 : well
2 : wait, no
3 : we don't need to helicopter anymore, i guess.
1 : no
2 : you need to if anything, you would need to helicopter to her go to her, so that she could helicopter
2 : the two of you can come to me and give me this.
1 : yeah
2 : so you wanna go here
3 : ok
1 : well first you should maybe
2 : if anything.
1 : shore up wait,
1 : because that would be
1 : one,
2 : yeah, wait so you're standing here right now.
1 : two
2 : right?
3 : yeah
1 : yeah, ok, i'm trying to think. so you could like shore this up, would be one.
3 : and then two, and then three.
1 : or move to it
1 : shore
1 : one
2 : move to that and then shore this up, do you mean?
3 : but i don't need to, i don't need to shore it.
1 : yeah
2 : just in case
3 : cause you still we still need to get
3 : you guys together
1 : yeah
3 : and i'm the only one can do that who can do that.
1 : but i'm
1 : thinking if you move here and then shore this up
3 : mmhmm
1 : that would be two and then
1 : you could fly to me.
2 : and then the third one to fly to you.
2 : yeah
3 : but you two need to be together, not me and you, right?
1 : yeah
2 : yeah so you're coming to her so that you two can come
1 : but i have to get this on my turn.
2 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : oh ok, yup, alright cool.
3 : so
1 : this one
2 : no, no, no, flip this
3 : yeah
3 : umm
1 : and then you can fly to me
1 : that would be three.
3 : but you can't i wasn't, i wasn't adjacent to that.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah but you moved here
1 : that's one turn.
3 : ok
2 : and then you flipped this, that's two. and then fly to her
1 : two
3 : oh ok
1 : and then you can fly to me.
3 : ok
2 : that's three
1 : yeah
3 : cool
1 : ok
2 : ok
3 : ok so
3 : 
3 : 
3 : umm anyhow, i guess i needed to
3 : get rid of two because
1 : yeah you can get rid of those two.
3 : yeah
3 : so and then floods
2 : oh we kinda played that wrong.
2 : uh
1 : what did we do?
2 : i think it's too late to go back but
2 : i think she should've just come here to like
2 : flip that cause like
1 : oh
2 : we could be screwed right now.
1 : well i think it's, i think it's still in here.
2 :  there might be two.
2 : ok well forget.
3 : alright
2 :  see that
1 : umm
2 : i think right?
2 : yeah, cool
3 : so
3 : over where's watchtower? i think watchtower's where you were. no it's not.
3 : and then
3 : marsh.
3 : ok, that was kinda safe.
2 : good
1 : ok
1 : so your helicopter
1 : the lift, you can
1 : either fly like a whole group of people if you're on the same tile
1 : or you could just like
1 : use it to fly one person somewhere, right?
3 : umm
1 : like
2 : does she has
2 : but she doesn't have to be with them. use to fly one or more
1 : yeah i think that
1 : right?
2 : other adventureres who are on the same
3 : it just yeah, it just says
2 : tile 
3 : yeah
2 : so you can fly yourself and others to the same tile.
1 : ok
3 : so i could, i could like give this to someone to do, basically. yeah
1 : yeah
1 : basically, yeah, ok.
3 : yeah
1 : so i'm
1 : gonna go ahead and do
1 : this, which is great. ok so that's one turn.
1 : and then
1 : i can't give you this until my next turn
1 : so
2 : wait, why?
3 : because we're not on the same tile.
1 : yeah, we have to be on the same tile.
2 : oh my god, i keep forgetting that.
1 : or you could use your helicopter lift
3 : mmhmm
1 : right now to get me up there.
2 : to fly her
3 : oh ok, i didn't know if i needed to use it on my turn.
1 : oh
2 : helicopter lift
1 : you do have to
2 : yes, that's what we were waiting for before.
3 : yeah
1 : use it on your turn.
3 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : i
2 : so
1 : think that's all. should i shore it up?
2 : are you
2 : yeah
3 : yeah
1 : i might as well just shore it up because i'm
1 : here because we don't need the other ones, and then
1 : that's probably
2 : ok
1 : i have a lift,
1 : water rise.
2 : now these ones
2 : go on top of that.
3 : mmhmm
1 : oh
3 : and they all get shuffled in
2 : yeah
3 : we
3 : pull three.
1 : ok now i pull three.
2 : mmhmm
3 : yup
1 : tidal palace is sunk.
1 : ok
2 : well
2 : yeah, ok, never mind.
1 : temple of the sun
2 : cause you're gonna have to fly me somewhere to get to the main land
3 : mmhmm
3 : yup
1 : oh yeah, misty marsh.
2 : ok
3 : alright
2 : so
1 : you should probably shore that up
3 : mmhmm
2 : yeah
1 : first.
2 : yeah
1 : yeah
2 : umm
3 : and then
2 : wait, what just happened with this?
1 : would
1 : on
2 : oh because you're not with me. why do i keep forgetting that? i'm so dumb.
1 : her turn
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok
2 : i'm screwed
2 : so
2 : i can't do anything.
1 : yeah
2 : umm, we don't need either of these
1 : oh wait that,
1 : that flood tile goes here.
2 : yeah
2 :  observatory
2 : sunk.
2 : watchtower sunk.
2 : and
2 : bronze gate
2 : is also sunk.
3 : ee we only deal with helicopters
3 : ok
3 : so i am flying who where?
2 : her to me
1 : the two of us to there.
3 : mk
2 : yeah
3 : so everyone, everyone goes here is what you're saying? yeah ok
1 : does that count as
1 : yeah
1 : does that count as that's one action right?
1 : that's just one.
3 : uh no
3 : the helicopter doesn't count as an action
1 : well, no, you can fly
1 : you can fly me, because that's your special power.
3 : ye
2 : you don't need to use that.
3 : yeah, but this counts as an action, this doesn't.
2 : is she allowed to take someone with her though?
3 : in this? yeah
2 : no for this.
1 : oh
3 : no.
1 : well
2 : oh
2 : one person one per turn.
3 : this is just, this is just me, flying around.
1 : oh ok
3 : so and that counts as an action for me but this doesn't, and the
1 : ok, yeah, so we need to do that.
3 : yeah.
3 : so
3 : that stays.
1 : ok
3 : umm
2 : wait, so you don't have to get rid of one of these now?
1 : yeah
3 : oh i, i do need to get rid of it, i just played it, yeah, ok.
2 : yeah, ok, i just got confused.
1 : i think that's all we were going to do
3 : yeah i think that's all that can happen right now.
1 : cause
2 : yeah
1 : unless you wanna fly
1 : wait ok, so we're not gonna need that tile, we're not gonna need this tile, we're not
1 : gonna really need this
3 : mmhmm
1 : tile because
3 : and we only need three of these treasures right? and so we're gonna get that on her next turn cause you're gonna give that to her
1 : mmhmm
3 : umm and she'll be able to claim it
1 : yeah
1 : maybe
2 : then that'll be the
3 : and then we all just need to get back here.
2 : yeah
1 : ok since maybe
2 : true
3 : so if we all hang tight, basically in this spot, we should be ok.
2 : and then you could fly us all together.
3 : yeah
1 : but we need one of those cards to leave fool's landing.
2 : one of these cards?
1 : yeah
2 : so oh
3 : mm
1 : so maybe
3 : yeah
2 : so she can only fly herself
2 : herself there, i see.
3 : well what you you have that. so what you can do
2 : oh if she gets us all off here
1 : mmhmm
3 : is you can fly us all, you can fly us all here. and then
2 : one of us can get us home.
1 : yeah
3 : we well you can't do that yet, cause we still have to get her treasure.
1 : yes
3 : so it would be like another two rounds and
3 : basically like crossing your fingers that nothing we need sinks.
3 : so
2 : well, it would only be so in the next
3 : yeah
2 : wait who's turn is it about to be?
2 : yours?
1 : mine.
3 : yours
2 : ok so
2 : you give me that
1 : mmhmm, so that counts as one turn.
2 : umm
2 : oh right because we can't evaucate until i get the thing.
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : yup
1 : ok i see what you're saying.
3 : so
2 : so yeah.
3 : alright, well let's
3 : oh yeah, do i need treasures? yeah.
1 : it's still her turn.
2 : oh
2 : gosh
3 : yeah so i need yeah
2 : damn. sorry.
3 : so, cool
3 : alright yeah.
1 : you can get rid of the chalice.
3 : three of those lovely, lovely things.
3 : so moon, where's moon? so moon gets flipped.
1 : ok
3 : garden gets flipped and
3 : oh both gardens get flipped.
1 : oh
3 : alright
3 : so
3 : and back.
3 : ok
1 : ok
3 : so
3 : your turn.
2 : make that move
3 : purple goes
1 : my turn, i'm giving this to you
2 : mmhmm
1 : and then
3 : you should shore up here, so we don't all sink
2 : i have to discard this.
3 : with nowhere to go.
3 : yeah
1 : oh, yeah
2 : oh actually it doesn't matter if i get this, it'll be the third
3 : yeah cause we already we'll have three. yeah
1 : yeah, ok, i was thinking maybe
1 : instead of shoring that up
1 : because i can't really it's not gonna sink
2 : is it in here?
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, it's on the top. so it's not gonna
2 : oh temple of the moon.
1 : it's not going to sink because i would have to like shuffle them, put them on top. cause i do that
2 : unless you get a water
3 : yeah it's possible that you get a water rise card and have to do that.
2 : and then have it be on top?
1 : do you shuffle it first and then
3 : yeah, you shuffle them and then you put em all on top.
2 : and then put it on top and then
1 : pull it?
1 : ok so
2 : so it's kinda risky.
3 : so, i would, i would shore it up.
2 : why wouldn't you flip it?
1 : well i was thinking
1 : because these are
1 : both at risk to sink.
1 : i could well no
2 : these you mean?
2 : like what are?
1 : these two which are do we have to have those to get the
2 : but we don't need that third one if we
2 : or that fourth one if we get the third.
3 : yeah, we only need three treasures. so we, we just need to get back here, we just need to get back here.
1 : oh, we only need three, ok.
2 : yeah, so
1 : so yeah, then i'll just shore this up
2 : shore it
3 : yeah
1 : and then
1 : that's it.
3 : alright
2 : ok
2 : ok well
1 : ok and then
1 : three so, silver gate, sunk.
1 : dunes of deception is sunk.
1 : coral palace is flipped.
2 : cool
3 : alright so you keep your helicopter card,
3 : i'll move us all here
3 : and then
3 : you take off.
1 : mmhmm
3 : that's how we win.
1 : ok
2 : so i'm gonna take this baby
3 : alright, cool.
2 : and i'm not going to do anything else.
1 : you have to treasure cards.
3 : you still have to do treasures and floods.
2 : yeah
2 : i meant like action. alright so that is that. water's
2 : rise.
3 : no
1 : oh boy
2 : yeah
1 : four cards
3 : alright so
2 : ok
1 : ok you have to shuffle those.
2 : so i'll shuffle
1 : ok that makes it easier that we only need
3 : mmhmm
3 : i feel like it'd be really hard to do if we needed to get all four, i don't think it'd be like
3 : it's just that  possible.
1 : yeah
2 : so we have
2 : whispering
3 : did you take
3 : four?
3 : ok
2 : yes.
2 : whispering garden
2 : is done.
3 : so that's done.
2 : temple of the moon
2 : is flipped.
3 : ok
3 : i was like whoa
2 : so
1 : ok
2 : umm
2 : temple of the sun
1 : gone.
3 : done.
2 : and coral palace is
1 : it's gone.
3 : alright
2 : how have we never picked a fool's landing card?
3 : i don't know.
3 : maybe there just aren't
1 : i know
3 : yeah i don't know.
2 : maybe they're at the bottom.
3 : alright so we are flying.
2 : yes, we're flying.
1 : get rid of that.
3 : and that's all we're doing.
2 : yeah
3 : so
1 : yeah and then, take your treasure cards.
3 : yup.
3 : just discard this guy, it doesn't matter
3 : and
2 : four
1 : four
1 : gues that just goes on top then.
2 : wait were there not four in there already?
1 : you have to put these ones back on top, right?
2 : no cause the waters didn't rise.
3 : yeah
1 : oh, oh, oh
3 : so it's just the next four, so it's fine.
1 : alright, sorry.
3 : alright, so, one, two, three, four.
1 : oh there's a fool's landing.
3 : umm all remaining things flip.
1 : wait, this is gone
1 : and that one's gone.
3 : umm this one's done.
3 : is this one done?
1 : mmhmm, it was flipped.
3 : but we didn't draw that card.
1 : i thought you said all remaining things
3 : no i, i mispoke.
1 : oh i thought it was like a card that said
3 : so yeah we flip
2 : that's this one, yeah.
3 : or
1 : yeah that gets flipped.
2 : yeah that's done.
3 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : and we can still exit when it's flipped, right? or no?
2 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
1 : i think so.
3 : ok
2 : i think, yeah.
3 : so
1 : well i could flip it anyway, so
3 : yeah, and then this guy or do we just flip this? yeah that's, i guess done.
1 : we
3 : doesn't matter.
2 : uh what was that?
3 : uh i don't
2 : we flipped all of them so like
1 : yeah we just flipped all of them
3 : oh we just flipped them, ok, yeah so that's alright that can still stay.
2 : yeah, i'm pretty sure that was still here.
1 : yeah
2 : yeah
1 : ok
3 : alright, so that's, that's that. these are the
3 : flood cards.
1 : ok so now it's my turn right?
2 : yeah
3 : and just leave. yeah we're done.
1 : ok i'll just flip this, in case cause i'm not sure if it has to be flipped over or not, but we'll do that.
3 : yup
3 : yeah, and then use your helicopter and we win.
2 : i don't know either.
1 : and then
1 : yeah helicopter goes over there and then
1 : yay.
3 : great, done.
2 : cool.
