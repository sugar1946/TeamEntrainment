4 : oh boy
1 : alright so
1 : should probably shore, shore these up.
1 : so if my first turn i'm gonna shore both these
1 : and then
1 : for my second turn i'll move to temple
1 : of the moon and shore both of these
1 : for my third
3 : ok
1 : final turn
4 : yeah
1 : now we have that
3 : two cards
1 : yup, two
1 : thanks
1 : water rises, so
4 : right away
1 : that goes here
3 : i'll take that over here.
1 : alright
1 : 
1 : so i have one
1 : and then,
3 : shuffle those guys.
1 : yup
1 : and then we have two.
1 : so temple of the moon and
1 : breaker's bridge
4 : so
1 : is this one
1 : the one i'm on.
1 : yeah
3 : ok, messenger.
2 : ok,
1 : messenger, you're up.
2 : so
3 : doesn't look like we're really close to completing anything right now.
4 : no, but we're also not that close to dying so
3 : mmhmm
2 : so can i just move?
2 : to misty marsh?
4 : uh yeah
4 : sure
2 : umm
4 : umm, well,
4 : unless
4 : i'm just thinking of
4 : if shoring up certain things is
3 : maybe shore up temple of the moon just before you go.
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
2 : so go back, can i do that?
4 : well, ju just like take,
4 : take back that move.
3 : s
3 : yeah
4 : if, if that's
4 : yeah, ok.
2 : i'm shoring up temple of the moon
4 : mmhmm
1 : then you might as well go
1 : down as well and
2 : to temple of the moon?
1 : yup
1 : and then
1 : shore up
1 : breaker,
1 : right?
4 : sure, why not?
3 : mmhmm
1 : guess the
3 : not a lot we can do right now
1 : there's the next two, yeah.
4 : right, yeah
3 : and these don't really matter all that much.
2 : ok
1 : yeah
2 : so then i take two of these?
1 : mmhmm
4 : mmhmm
2 : two sandbags
1 : so
4 : helpful
1 : yeah
4 : alright, and then, do we still get flood cards?
1 : yeah, two flood cards.
4 : what do we got?
2 : cliffs of abandon and golden gate
4 : so golden gate's gone
1 : which is fine
3 : i'll take the card. that gold thingy
1 : and what's the other one?
3 : thank you
2 : cliffs of abandon.
1 : so
1 : nice
2 : so that's discarded.
3 : mmhmm
4 : right
4 : ok
1 : so  cards
3 : alright
3 : my turn.
4 : yes.
3 : so
1 : not much to do.
3 : no
1 : i guess you could fly over and
3 : umm
1 : shore up.
2 : i can take
3 : so you have two of those
2 : yeah, i can give you any of these cards.
4 : yeah, you could shore up both of the places that need to be shored up right now.
3 : mmhmm.
4 : just by like
1 : moving up one.
2 : you can i can give you this can't i.
2 : or no is that part of your
3 : no
1 : yeah, we're 
1 : we don't need to do that, yeah, i don't think
3 : i also don't know if you can trade these but you can play them
4 : oh no i don't
3 : out of turn so
3 : it doesn't really matter.
1 : yeah so maybe your first move, yeah
4 : yeah, wait a minute.
3 : so i could go here
1 : shore up
4 : shore up
3 : two
1 : and then
4 : and then
3 : three, oh.
4 : oh yeah
3 : no, so i can't do that.
4 : well
1 : you can
4 : that, that one over there is probably more important than phantom rock
1 : fly.
3 : so i'll just, m
4 : cause it's in the middle.
3 : i'll just move to your space,
4 : sure!
3 : although i guess you're probably gonna move.
1 : what what do we wanna
1 : move to?
3 : so i'll move here,
1 : wait, wouldn't you wanna move to one of these land on one of these?
4 : nah
1 : just in case, cause what if you
1 : we all get it, we can all end up
3 : so i think i should try to get on the same space as other people, so that if i need to i can we can give cards later
1 : or maybe not
1 : ok
1 : uh
4 : that, that sounds like a good idea.
3 : so i'll just go here.
1 : ok
4 : whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, does not
1 : i like it.
3 : i flew
1 : yeah, he can fly there, pilot
4 : oh yeah!
4 : helicopters
1 : alright
1 : so then
3 : and i'll take my two
4 : sure
1 : two
3 : chalice
3 : another helicopter lift.
4 : helicopter
1 : nice
1 : then there's still two floods
3 : yeah
1 : so the phantom of the rock and the lost lagoon
3 : i'll take the rock card.
4 : what's lost oh
1 : right here.
4 : ok
4 : so
4 : i can move diagonally to
4 : isn't that exciting?
1 : really not much to do
2 : you wanna try to get to
3 : s
2 : temple of the moon?
4 : yeah, well no, what i can do is one, two, three.
2 : if you go to cliffs of aban
1 : or you could
3 : or you could go
1 : i like that move
1 : now we're all
3 : or you could give her this
4 : oh, that's very true. umm
4 : so
4 : yeah, i kind of like that
4 : better
4 : umm
1 : yeah
2 : you give me that
4 : so,
2 : card.
4 : one,
4 : two,
4 : there you go.
2 : then we can take
2 : that.
1 : no, not yet.
2 : cause don't you have to have
4 : not yet, you need one more.
3 : on your turn, yeah.
2 : oh four, i thought it was three, four out of five
1 : you need f and you need four, but we need
1 : 
3 : and you also need to get to either this space or this space.
1 : yeah
2 : oh, ok
1 : we gotta pick up two.
4 : and, oh look at that, we could get the
1 : 
1 :  two more.
4 : the, the blue one.
1 : uh
1 : the iron gate and whispering garden.
2 : chalice
4 : whispering gardens, is that
4 : right here. and iron
4 : gate is
1 : right there.
3 : oh
4 : right
1 : good
4 : ok
4 : so now, we're in a position
4 : we can try and start plotting to get
3 : both of those to him.
4 : yeah, or
1 : or i can just use two different turns
4 : well yeah cause
1 : i don't have to move any 
1 : who
1 : so we should give it
1 : oh wait
1 : we have to 
1 : that's ok.
4 : well, give, giving a card takes up one turn right?
3 : and you have to you can only give a like he can't take.
1 : right
1 : i can give two.
4 : right
2 : and i can give a card anytime.
3 : oh i see, so if you give both to him
1 : i could give two
4 : you can?
4 : is it anytime or anywhere?
1 : yeah,
1 : both to you
1 : wait can you d
2 : give treasure cards to a player anywhere on the island for one action per card.
1 : yeah look and then when
4 : ok, but it still has to be your turn.
3 : so that's on your turn, yeah.
1 : but then you can go,
2 : oh, when it's my turn, yeah.
1 : then you can go.
4 : mmhmm
1 : one,
1 : you can move him over to if i give him both of mine
1 : then you can give him one and then you can f
3 : him the last one and then he can get it.
1 : right
3 : yeah
4 : nah
1 : and you can move em there, so
3 : mmhmm
1 : this is
1 : turn one,
4 : k, and yeah, that's good
1 : turn two,
4 : cause that's five
1 : right
1 : and then
2 : oh yeah, we can only have five.
1 : uh
1 : i don't
1 : and then my oh wait, shh should we 
3 : so you have a
1 : yeah, it's fine.
2 : can
4 : yeah
1 : i don't need to move.
4 : you don't need to move, no
1 : i'm fine, with that
2 : can
2 : oh
1 : or
1 : what else do we need anything else?
3 : i mean there's not
1 : i can only move
2 : i didn't know if you could shore up
3 : it would be nice to shh
3 : it would be nice to shore this one up,
3 : just cause
4 : but i mean,
1 : you just gotta hope there's no water rising.
3 : yeah
2 : true
1 : cause it's already in the pile, as long as we don't get a water rise then we're alright.
3 : mmhmm
1 : so that's it, i'm good.
1 : take two there.
3 : and if, if we do draw water's rise
3 : we can always sandbag it.
2 : true
1 : of course, right
4 : right
4 : so, do, do we wanna sandbag it immediately, just in case?
2 : i have a sandbag.
4 : right
1 : umm
2 : i can give to him.
3 : mm
4 : yeah, cause i mean like once the flooding card is drawn, then it's gone.
1 : i don't think it
1 : does it matter?
3 : it's ok if we lose this one, but then we have to be extra protective of this one.
4 : so if we're gonna
1 : cause we haven't yeah, we have to keep that one.
4 : ok, so
1 : so let's keep it.
4 : so yeah.
2 : oh
1 : and then
3 : and you have to move the meter up.
1 : oh yeah
4 :  get three.
1 : take
1 : three.
1 : the first one's lost lagoon,
3 : yeah we lost it.
1 : cliffs of
3 : that was unintentional.
1 : abandon.
4 : yup
1 : and the temple of the moon.
2 : mm
1 : which is ok, cause i'm glad i stayed there cause i could just bring them both back.
4 : yeah
4 : right
1 : next turn.
1 : ok
2 : ok,
2 : so
2 : what should i do?
4 : should she head
1 : you know what? you might as well use the sand
3 : she should probably shore
3 : no, she i mean she can shore up.
1 : shore up
4 : mmhmm
1 : no i think she shh
3 : she can't do both, but
1 : you should probably sho use a sandbag, because when you draw two cards
1 : you're gonna have to get rid of two cards.
2 : this
3 : eh
2 : using the sandbag doesn't count as an action.
2 : two, by the way.
4 : right
1 : right
3 : yeah, so
1 : because what if she
3 : yeah, she's gonna have to discard a card anyway
1 : right
1 : so you have to discard two cards.
4 : well,
4 : i mean,
1 : wait she'll have to
1 : you know, we'll be able to pick out of it
4 : yeah, i mean there's always the chance that she gets like two more chalices and then i mean we don't really need
1 : which ones
1 : just throw
4 : wait she could just get rid of those.
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, this is true, this is true.
2 : so,
4 : so just
1 : so no
4 : hold on to it for now.
1 : hold on to that.
4 : umm
4 : i'd think
1 : yeah, shore up
2 : i can shore up
4 : yeah, sho shoring up probably the best.
1 : shores
1 : yeah it
1 : yeah you might as well cause there's only two cards now
1 : so
1 : they're gonna
1 : if we if you pull a water rise's card then
1 : 
2 : does it matter which ones i shore up?
1 : both,
1 : right?
2 : there's
4 : yeah
4 : umm
4 : just
2 : should i
4 : yeah
2 : since the one we're on is probably more important i would i mean like we're all on it.
3 : i mean yo
4 : i mean
3 : yeah
4 : it's
2 : if it gets sunk we're dead we're done.
4 : right, so, so, both of them.
1 : yeah both of them will be
1 : 
3 : plus like
3 : i don't know, i'm ok losing these ones out around the perimeter, but
1 : yeah
1 : right, me too
4 : yeah
2 : mmhmm
3 : like we need to be able to navigate
4 : mmhmm
3 : the main island, yeah.
2 : to fool's landing to
4 : right
2 : so there's two moves.
2 : i don't have to go another move if i don't want to.
4 : nope
2 : so treasure cards
2 : sandbag
4 : oh look at that!
2 : and the this
4 : well
1 : see
3 : ok
4 : you, you, you could emergency use a sandbag, right now i think
1 : yeah
3 : yeah, so i would use one of the sandbags, maybe on this
1 : use a sandbag but on
2 : ok
1 : yeah.
2 : ok
4 : mmhmm
1 : yeah, for sure.
3 : and then you still have to discard a card, so maybe just the fire one.
4 : yeah
1 : yeah,
1 : perfect.
4 : and then
1 : and your next move
1 : oh, yeah.
4 : next, next turn you can go and
1 : so now you ahve to pick three
2 : these
1 : of these, yeah.
4 : yeah, and, and next turn you can go to the
2 : mm
4 : garden
2 : just as a turn?
1 : yeah
4 : get
1 : yeah one
1 : or
4 :  one, two
2 : breaker's bridge,
4 :  it.
3 : i can fly her there.
2 : iron gate, that's sunk,
2 : iron gate.
2 : whispering garden.
4 : da da dun
1 : that was a good
4 : umm
3 : ok.
1 : and move there.
4 : so now
3 : i'll give you this
4 : cool.
1 : 
3 : oh you have to discard a card now.
1 : that's ok.
2 : mmhmm
4 : that's fine.
3 : so that was one,
3 : umm,
4 : or mm, nope, nope, that's, that's how that had to happen, yeah.
1 : would it be
1 : what about
1 : uh
3 : i can
1 : would it be s
1 : cause the next move
1 : essentially would be
3 : i can fly here
3 : and shore this one up.
1 : you can fly there and she can give you all her card.
1 : or you can only give one
3 : no, you ca that would take four actions to give.
2 : i could sandbag the
1 : no, she's the, she's the messenger i thought.
3 : but i can use the helicopter
1 : or you get these, or is it actually when you use it?
3 : i have an idea
4 : 
2 : oh, when i use the
1 : when you use your power
1 : it count as an action?
4 : i think it counts as an action for you, yeah.
3 : but it has to be her turn.
2 : for one action per card. yeah it has to be my turn, i keep forgetting that.
3 : it has to be her turn.
1 : oh ok
1 : oh ok
3 : yeah
2 : but i thought
3 : so
2 : to anyone when it is his or her turn.
3 : so the only thing i think
3 : what yours does is it lets you like you don't have to be on the same space as people.
2 : mm
3 : so even if you're across the island you can give your cards to people
4 : mmhmm
4 : right
2 : but i think if it's on their turn i can give them a card, right?
1 : uh, i see
1 : i see what you're saying, yeah.
4 : i no, no, i it still has to be your turn.
3 : i don't
3 : think so.
3 : cause it says as an action,
2 : look at the
3 : and the actions are only on your turn.
4 : yeah, you can only make an action on your turn.
4 : to anyone, anywhere
2 : oh
2 : when it's my turn. sorry, read that wrong.
4 : mmhmm
3 : mmhmm
4 : yes
3 : so i think what i'm gonna do umm, is i'm gonna shore this up
4 : so we get two moves
4 : right
1 : yeah
3 : and then i'm gonna use a helicopter lift
3 : to move
3 : uh both of us
3 : to here.
3 : and then i'll use my lakst, last action to shore it up.
4 : mmhmm
2 : mm
4 : i like that.
3 : and then on your turn you don't have to move anywhere, you can just
3 : get this right away.
2 : k
1 : i like it.
3 : everyone ok with that?
4 : i'm ok with that
1 : yeah
4 :  yep
3 : and flip that.
3 : 
4 : fell off the island.
3 : and i'll draw two cards
4 : back up
3 : and if you can flip three of those for me.
4 : and then flood everything.
1 : three of those.
3 : so, copper gate,
3 : crimson forest,
3 : and temple of the sun.
4 : hmm
4 : alright
4 : so
1 : you gonna make it right to
1 : down here.
4 : yeah, i can get there in two moves so that'll probably be
1 : and then your third one
4 : ideal.
1 : is does it move to collect the
4 : yeah, so
1 : so that's one, two, three,
1 : and we get
1 : one of
4 : one,
4 : two,
4 : give me the cup.
4 : i think i discard these now.
1 : and then two,
1 : two cards.
4 : oh boy, they're rising!
2 : mm
1 : so
2 : move it up one.
4 : moving on up
2 : still three.
4 : sure
4 : split in half
4 : is
1 : that goes over there.
4 : and then we get three.
1 : yeah
4 : and it is oh look at that, the temple of the sun is gone.
4 : as is copper gate,
4 : and breaker's bridge is
2 : shh
1 : sure
2 : or flooded
1 : flooded
4 : so,
4 : uh
4 : temple of the moon just
4 : became possibly important if we want to
1 : 
4 : get
3 : mm
4 : the earth crystal.
1 : which one is that?
4 : that's the purple one
3 : this one here
4 : or
1 : ok
1 : yeah, grayish.
4 : gray
1 : umm
4 : uh the one that's purple skittled color.
1 : so
1 : i'm gonna shore up this one
1 : and
1 : s so  we'll have two of those.
4 : yeah, i i don't really know if there's anything else that you can do right now, like
4 : you
4 : are gonna be getting
4 : that one on your turn.
2 : mmhmm
4 : i think that for us two we should probably try and get
1 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : these
4 : to him
4 : as soon as possible.
3 : so he can move closer to if he moves here then he's closer to both of us.
4 : that's true,
4 : that's true. and he's still within range to shore it up so
4 : that might be a good idea.
1 : or
1 : we would have to go all the way around but
1 : i could give this
1 : to you.
1 : that way you could fly her
1 : at any point
3 : but you can't
4 : yeah, you can't give to him unless
1 : oh, i can't cause i'm not
3 : you can't get to me and give it to me this turn.
1 : yeah, i'm too far.
3 : so if you move
1 : umm, just move one space to
4 : to cliffs of abandon which somehow are on the middle of the island
1 : yeah, yeah i like that.
3 : yeah
1 : i like that move.
4 : despite being seaside.
1 : alright, that's good.
4 : yeah
1 : so two of those cards.
1 : a helicopter
4 : oh boy there we go
3 : that helps
4 : that helps out a lot
2 : mmhmm
1 : uh
4 : then flood the island.
1 : crimson for forest.
3 : is gone
4 : but
4 : oh dear
1 :  ok sorry
3 : no problem
1 : uh
1 : cliffs of abandon,
1 : this is where i'm at.
1 : and then uh whispering gardens.
2 : mm
4 : get it done fast.
3 : alright
2 : now do i have to shore that up?
3 : you don't have to
4 : no you could just get it and then skedaddle.
2 : i can just get it?
1 : yeah just
1 : yeah so
2 : so i just discard these?
1 : turn that in
1 : yeah
4 : mmhmm.
3 : the other like benefit of shoring things up is that
2 : it's
3 : as these cards, as we run out of these cards we're gonna be tearing through those ones faster
4 : that's true, that's very true, so
2 : yeah
3 : so if you can shore things up
4 : yeah
4 : do it.
2 : should i just shore it up?
3 : yeah i mean this
4 : yeah
2 : as a move?
1 : well
1 : yeah, i guess as a
1 : that's it doesn't matter, either way
1 : so that's
3 : or
4 : yeah, yeah, i think that's a
1 : that's fine, that's fine, yeah it's a smart move.
3 : ok
2 : and then
1 : and then
1 : that's your second
2 : discard these
1 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
2 : and then
1 : and then
1 : i mean
2 : should i
2 : give this away, is this necessary?
1 : no
4 : i
1 : i would keep that cause you could
1 : like we just ran into the last time, you could use it at any point so
3 : mm
4 : actually
1 : think you should use it
4 : i'm like w-what i'm most worried about is this right here cause right now you guys can kinda move down there though you still have helicopter lift actually, so it's not that big a deal.
3 : right
1 : yes
3 : but
3 : yeah no i see what you're saying cause if we lost this then we would have to go around.
4 : but if that's gone, then you have to go all the way around so umm
2 : mmhmm
2 : should i s
1 : we don't need any of those
1 : really
3 : hmm?
4 : yeah, it, it, it's just a matter of taking an extra whole round
2 : not now
4 : around the table
1 : right
4 : to get back.
3 : well i can, i can fix i can shore this up on my turn.
4 : yeah
3 : so if you just wanna move
3 : closer to fool's landing.
4 : to misty marsh!
2 : and then
1 : yeah
2 : draw two?
1 : yup
4 : mmhmm
4 : oh boy, fire.
3 : ok
1 : nice
4 : back up plan.
2 : and then three.
1 : yup
2 : silver gate, tidal palace, and temple of the moon.
1 : temple of the moon
4 : silver gate
1 : what's the other one?
3 : tidal palace.
4 : it's over there, yeah.
3 : ok
1 : well
4 : so now
3 : so
3 : i think
3 : for my first action
3 : mm
3 : so i'm gonna fly here
4 : mmhmm
3 : and then i'm gonna give this
3 : to the engineer.
4 : mmhmm
3 : and then i was gonna shore up this but i think i need to shore up this.
4 : yeah i think that that's the best idea right now.
3 : and that's my three.
2 : mm
4 : ok
4 : you can always swim over to the temple of the moon,
4 : need be.
4 : right?
4 : ok, so
2 : mm then
2 : three cards
3 : oh yeah
3 : so bronze gate,
1 : got it
3 : cave of shadows,
3 : and the dunes of deception.
4 : cool
4 : so
4 : oo
1 : which piece are you, the green one?
4 : yeah
