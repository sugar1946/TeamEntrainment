1 : ok.
1 : umm.
3 : ok engineer.
2 : alright
1 : so.
1 : i guess like i should just try to shore up as much as i can cause that's what i'm best at.
2 : yeah.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : so i can shore up
2 : yeah.
1 : these two.
3 : ok.
1 : and move over here and shore up these two.
1 : which is like
1 : a bit of saftey i guess
3 : mmhmm.
1 : and then can i get
1 : two treasure cards?
2 : yeah
1 : ooo
1 : alright.
1 : i got a water's rise.
1 : umm.
1 : ok so
1 : bump this up.
1 : and then i draw two flood
1 : tiles.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : yeah but there is no
3 : there's none.
3 : oh there are.
1 : oh there is a discard pile.
1 : you tricked me.
1 : alright, i'll just
1 : shuffle it up a bit
1 : alright.
1 : and then draw two.
2 : two.
1 : which are the lost lagoon and phantom rock.
1 : so lost lagoon.
1 : and we lost
3 : phantom rock
1 : we lost phantom rock.
2 : we lost phantom rock.
3 : ok.
1 : that doesn't really, i don't think that does anything.
1 : so
2 : no it's ok.
1 : this one goes back and i think this is put
1 : in to the
3 : oh we have to put the phantom rock over here.
1 : this one's removed, yeah.
2 : yeah.
1 : i don't think it matters that phantom rock is gone though.
1 : cause like it didn't do anything and is at the edge of the board.
2 : no
3 : yeah.
2 : no.
1 : alright. so your turn.
2 : alright.
3 : alright you have two of those
3 : ok.
2 : i will
2 : first move.
2 : i'll meet you there.
3 : ok.
2 : umm.
2 : i can't shore up.
2 : if i gave you 
2 : if i gave the engineer ocean's
2 : chalice
1 : y
2 : would that
1 : i mean it might help but you could also do that without being on my square.
2 : cause you have that one
2 : yeah.
3 : it'd be better to give him a card than
3 : the rest of us.
1 : i think it makes sense to kinda like
2 : well you have two fires already we can only have five
3 : mmhmm.
2 : so.
1 : yeah
2 : i'll hold on to it for now.
1 : mmhmm.
2 : umm
2 : i don't think there's really
1 : i think that there's nothing to do really except like shore this up cause
2 : any
2 : yeah i can't really
1 : like we don't have enough treasures to make anything happen.
3 : so you could move again?
2 : yeah.
1 : so yeah i would move.
2 : umm.
1 : down to breaker's bridge and shore it up, cause i don't think there's anything we can do.
2 : no i can't do, i can't do diagonal.
1 : no, no, if you just go down, cause you still have two left.
3 : no.
3 : it's adjacent.
1 : i don't think there's anything like
1 : to do this turn cause we don't have any treasures.
2 : no i just mo i move there.
1 : so that's one.
2 : already
3 : you can move one more time.
1 : and then you can move once more and then shore it up.
2 : oh ok.
2 : ok.
2 : alright.
2 : getting the hang of this now.
2 : alright that's it for me.
1 : alright
1 : and then you get like your two treasures
2 : oh yeah.
2 : let's see.
2 : earth stone and sandbags.
3 : ok.
3 : does he
2 : then
1 : you got.
3 : oh.
2 : i guess
1 : you got a
1 : just
1 : draw two of them. we're not like
2 : yeah.
2 : ok.
2 : cliffs.
2 : cliffs of abandon and breakers.
1 : i think
2 : bridge
2 : see, cliffs.
2 : breakers.
1 : yeah
2 : bridge?
1 : that's really good.
2 : alright.
3 : yeah, you're on it.
2 : ok.
2 : then discard.
3 : hey just so you guys know i have the helicopter lift so at any time i can move one or more pawns to another tile.
1 : mmhmm
3 : i don't think that there's anything.
1 : i don't think there's any urgency.
2 : umm
3 : yeah.
2 : no, yes save that
3 : umm.
3 : probably, i should move here?
1 : i think.
3 : and get him up?
2 : umm.
1 : yeah, i think it kinda makes sense to just like shore these two up cause we've got
1 : we don't have enough treasures to do anything.
2 : yeah.
3 : yeah.
1 : i think.
3 : so that's one.
1 : i don't know.
3 : move
1 : that's two.
3 : two moves, i can also f
1 : and then that's three.
1 : cause you moved once.
3 : yeah.
2 : yeah.
1 : but that's.
1 : good, it looks like everything's like
1 : we have less
3 : shore it up.
2 : just, yeah just one and we're in.
1 : yeah we have less floods than we started with.
3 : alright.
2 : yeah.
1 : and that piece doesn't really matter.
1 : also
2 : yeah we're good.
3 : ok, now we just have to think about
3 : getting our
3 : right cards
2 : yeah.
2 : two.
1 : we just have to worry about treasures for now.
2 : two treasures.
3 : ok.
2 : yeah.
3 : alright, i have another helicopter lift.
2 : fire
2 : alright.
1 : ok.
3 : the fire
3 : two of my flood cards
3 : ok, gold gate and whispering garden.
2 : ok well this one's out.
2 : then
3 : ok.
1 : eh oh well.
3 : whispering garden.
2 : whispering garden.
2 : it's this
3 : ok.
1 : alright.
1 : umm.
1 : ok.
1 : ahh.
1 : uh maybe i should start heading to like
1 : this or this.
1 : cause
3 : mmhmm.
2 : umm
1 : i have two of these so when i get like
1 : you have one and then if i get the last one then i can just fill it up.
3 : right.
1 : so what if i like.
1 : shore up.
1 : what
3 : whispering
3 : oh s
3 : oh
1 : oh.
2 : oh yeah.
1 : oh i think you removed
1 : the wrong one maybe.
2 : yes umm.
3 : sorry
2 : no this one, this one stays cause that one's gone.
1 : ok
2 : this yeah
1 : ok, so i think i should shore this up.
2 : yeah.
1 : one.
1 : two three.
1 : and then like, i'm closer here.
1 : she can give me that next turn.
2 : yeah and we s we still only have three, so.
1 : so yeah
2 : we s
3 : but i also have a he i have two helicopter lift cards so i could move you to one of these islands anyway.
1 : i don't think
1 : how bout we can save them.
1 : like there's no er, i think, alright so one
2 : yeah.
3 : yeah.
1 : two.
1 : three and then next turn you can give me that and i'll have three.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : and then.
1 : can i get the two treasures?
2 : yeah.
1 : so if i get like a third fight.
1 : yeah right perfect.
2 : alright sweet.
3 : got it.
1 : one two
1 : alright
3 : ok.
1 : ok so that when
1 : oh that kinda sucks.
2 : oh now you have to wait another turn to do that then cause you have to get rid of one
1 : yeah.
1 : hmm.
2 : alright.
3 : alright we got one of these and
3 : one of these but
2 : yeah.
1 : alright
1 : ah and then i draw my
2 : yeah i think
2 : yeah that's your flood
1 : flood tiles of uh
1 : the temple of the moon
1 : and the
1 : iron
1 : gate
1 : it's over there.
1 : alright
2 : alright.
3 : mm k
1 : so that's it.
2 : let's see what my strategy is, umm.
2 : it's easy to bring me that next turn.
3 : yeah.
3 : what's your special power?
2 : ah give treasure cards to the player when
2 : uh anywhere on the island.
3 : mm k
1 : so yeah i think for now just like shore things up
3 : s 
2 : umm, well i need to meet up with you then cause you can't give me cards anywhere.
2 : but i can give you cards anywhere.
1 : yeah.
2 : right.
1 : so what if
3 : yeah but he can't get any more cards.
3 : but
1 : i get
2 : well yeah that no that's what i'm not giving him any but he but i have to be on the same one as him for me to for him to give
1 : hmm
3 : mmhmm.
3 : ok.
1 : so i guess
1 : yeah, move
2 : i'll just move there.
1 : and then while your there you might as well shore up.
1 : the
1 : cave of shadows
2 : i think that one isn't.
2 : is it?
1 : oh is that?
1 : that's right side up.
2 : i i can't tell if it's yeah ok.
1 : wow there's like nothing for you to do that's kinda funny.
2 : umm
2 : yeah.
2 : alright that's it.
3 : ok.
2 : oh wait, no, no, no, no, i'm gonna use this.
3 : and you took the
3 : you're gonna shore that?
1 : no that's al that's already shored up.
2 : umm, i'll shore up this one.
3 : good.
1 : you just can't tell
1 : that's, is that an action though? oh that didn't
1 : didn't it say like special actions don't count as that.
2 : mmhmm.
1 : sp
1 : that doesn't count as an action.
3 : oh yeah, helicopter and sandbags.
3 : doesn't count as
3 : an action
2 : yeah.
2 : no that's ok.
1 : ok.
3 : but you can still
2 : i don't, i don't need to, i don't need to use an action
1 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
2 : but
3 : ok.
2 : yeah.
3 : alright.
3 : i
3 : so i could fly all of us some place i don't think i need to do that, you don't need to move yet right?
1 : yup.
2 : oh
1 : i don't think you can give that to, oh yea you got to get your treasure.
2 : hold on, hold on, i need to
2 : i always forget to do that. ok water's rise.
3 : oh.
2 : so three this time
1 : ok
1 : wait, wait, wait, we gotta shuffle them back in.
2 : yeah.
1 : i can't
1 : can't shuffle them like a normal deck of cards
2 : ok we got
2 : breaker's bridge, whispering garden and iron gate.
1 : so iron
3 : iron gate.
1 : iron gate is gone
2 : whispering garden and then breaker's bridge
2 : here.
1 : ok.
2 : ok.
3 : ok.
3 : i should fly to a different island and
3 : get these back.
3 : shore them up again.
3 : right?
1 : mm
1 : i don't
2 : umm, yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : i think you can just, you can just shore them up without using the lift thought.
1 : but yeah
3 : no, no. i but i can fly anyway.
3 : so
1 : oh, right, right.
3 : yeah.
3 : that's
2 : yeah
3 : so that's
1 : so that's
1 : that's two
3 : two.
3 : three cause i'm gonna hold off giving you a card.
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
1 : so i got
1 : a couple too many.
3 : alright.
3 : ahh
3 : anything else?
2 : all of them are shored up.
3 : yeah.
2 : umm then you just have to
1 : mm
1 : yeah, i think we're just collecting treasures and just keeping things shored up for now.
3 : ok, i gotta a sandbag.
2 : yeah.
3 : everything's shored up.
2 : duh
3 : and one of these
2 : yes.
2 : ok
3 : so i next move i give you
3 : er
3 : then to give you that one.
3 : ok umm.
2 : three of these.
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah.
1 : yeah.
3 : let's just hope
3 : for
2 : wait
2 : ok.
3 : yeah.
1 : it's three of them yeah
3 : that's three.
2 : ok
3 : alright, lost lagoon
1 : oh
3 : cliffs of abandon and the temple of moon
3 : umm
1 : cliffs of abandon right here in the middle
2 : here
3 : go ahead
1 : and
2 : then
3 : and the lost lagoon
3 : over there.
1 : oh
2 : alright.
3 : ok.
1 : great.
1 : umm.
1 : so i'm gonna give
1 : this to them
1 : oh you have six cards you have to
1 : get rid of one.
3 : ah
3 : do these count?
1 : i guess so
1 : umm.
2 : yeah.
3 : ok.
3 : i'll get rid of
1 : i think you should get rid of the sandbag
1 : cause
3 : yeah cause we don't need that
3 : good thinking
1 : and
1 : oh wait can we get rid of tre-are there more than, if there more than four of a kind of treasures which there must be i think it's actually safe to get rid of treasures
2 : there's probably eight.
2 : yeah.
1 : yeah i think it's safe to get rid of like
1 : you can get rid of
1 : a treasure
3 : are there more than four of these? 
1 : there must be the deck is huge.
3 : alright.
3 : we willing to take that chance?
2 : mm
1 : yeah i think so.
1 : let's go for it.
1 : what could possibly go wrong?
3 : yeah i don't know.
2 : might be at the bottom.
3 : yeah we could hit the bottom because
1 : sandbags seems better.
2 : well we have two.
3 : this is the one we need right?
3 : w
2 : two oceans, three earths, four fires
1 : to be honest, i think you just might want to get rid of the fire.
1 : cause like
1 : odds are by the time
1 : it gets
1 : back around to someone
1 : we'll have drawn another one
1 : and you can just use the sandbag
1 : now
2 : mm
3 : so what you're saying is we should assume that there's more there but if there's not
1 : well like the deck is huge, how could there not be.
3 : then we're
3 : i don't know
3 : ok.
2 : no but we
2 : if she gives you that one then we get rid of all
2 : all four of those.
2 : when we get the treasure.
1 : oh the other thing is if we
3 : because i could fly and if we could all get on the same one then i could fly us
3 : here
1 : yeah
3 : and then
3 : we could have that
3 : treasure off
2 : yeah and all those cards would be gone.
1 : mmhmm
3 : and the, right.
1 : yeah
1 : what's
3 : i think
1 : oh gosh.
3 : yeah i think it's better just to start getting treasures off the island
2 : yeah.
2 : let's, yeah get stuff out of the way.
1 : ok yeah i think you should.
3 : better safe than sorry
2 : and then we won't have to worry about
1 : yeah i guess just get rid of the sandbag then.
2 : then we won't have to worry about either of those to tiles to shore up.
3 : yeah.
3 : because this one it seems that
1 : i think we're already shoring everything up fine.
3 : we're doing pretty good anyway.
3 : yeah.
1 : that's kind of
2 : yeah.
1 : ugh if i, if i'd been thinking though like if i'd played this like
1 : you could have just given me this anyway and then i could have gotten rid of
1 : these two
1 : cause i'm sure there are a ton of them, the deck is like, it's like a hundred cards
2 : yeah
3 : ok you know what, we're gonna find out
2 : alright
3 : probably by this next time
2 : yeah, let's let's keep going
1 : alright
1 : so let's see
1 : ah i'll just
1 : hmm
1 : ok i'll just give you a card actually, i'll give you
2 : yeah then i'll be, then i'll be at max
1 : this
1 : i'll give you
1 : this
1 : shore up
1 : this
1 : and go here
1 : umm
1 : and then i get two treasure cards
1 : if one of them's a fire then we already have enough
3 : then we'll see what's goin on
1 : nope
1 : i got six so i got to get rid of one of them
2 : umm
1 : i'll get rid of
3 : he's good
3 : we could
3 : we could now have four of these
2 : either it's just
1 : alright so i'll get rid of
3 : the chalice
2 : it's up to chance so either one
1 : get rid of the chalice
3 : yeah
1 : it also said that we only had to have
1 : three of them right so we could just kind of
1 : chose a treasure to abandon
3 : mmhmm
1 : right now
1 : so we should just go for this and this and i guess the gold ones we'll just
2 : umm
3 : well actually we would have had
3 : ok
3 : umm
3 : we probably should have gotten rid of this because then he would have had two and it would have been real easy to give him the third one
3 : does that make any sense
3 : you could
3 : oh
3 : he would have had three
2 : umm
1 : yeah
1 : it does
1 : oops
3 : ok
3 : it's ok
2 : oh it's ok
1 : we're fine
1 : i think we're gonna win
1 : ah
2 : we have twenty one
3 : we have twenty one minutes plenty of time
1 : copper gate
1 : is
1 : there
1 : crimson
1 : forest is there
2 : and then howling garden
1 : and howling garden
1 : alright it doesn't matter if the howling garden gets flooded also though cause this one's closer
1 : and it's at the edge of the board so like we're not going to be crossing through
2 : yeah
2 : ok
3 : alright you're there s
3 : umm
1 : 
2 : it's yeah ah umm
3 : oh
3 : laughs
2 : let's see
2 : should i
1 : i kinda like the idea of
2 : hmm
1 : right now you use your helicopter lift
1 : to fly yourself there
3 : uh huh
1 : and then he spends his turn just giving you these two
2 : she has five cards
1 : yeah but if you use the helicopter
1 : oh
3 : yeah
3 : well actually if i used the helicopter lift then it would go off
1 : oh you'd still have six
3 : and then i'd yeah
2 : you still have one
3 : but i'm
1 : alright
3 : and then i'd only have three i wouldn't have four
3 : you're the one that's gonna
2 : yeah we need to focus on the fire
3 : yeah
1 : i'm on the fire with three of them so you just have to give me one
2 : yeah
3 : uh huh
1 : when it's your turn
3 : and that's gonna be my turn
2 : and then you can get rid of one of those yeah
1 : mmhmm.
3 : alright, you're here now?
2 : so
2 : can i just shore up?
3 : well the only way you could shore up is to move one two
2 : i can do
3 : or one, if you move over here then can't you shore up that one?
3 : cause it's adjacent?
1 : yeah maybe you should go one two and shore this up to make sure this doesn't flood.
2 : cause
2 : yeah cause this one
2 : if this one
2 : gets umm
2 : umm
2 : i forget what you call it
1 : no this is still shored up
2 : yeah, yeah but if in if the chance we lose this one, we won't be able to get to this one.
3 : this one's ok
1 : yeah
2 : so
1 : yeah i like just going there cause you can still give
2 : if i do that, ok
1 : things long distance
2 : yeah
2 : yeah.
2 : alright
1 : this
2 : one, two
1 : ok
2 : three
1 : we'll grab two treasures
3 : there's
2 : water's rise
3 : more than three
1 : water's rise, i gotta shuffle these in.
2 : yeah shuffle, i can you i'll get rid of this one.
3 : two, yeah.
2 : breaker's bridge, lost lagoon and whispering garden
1 : whispering garden
3 : where's lagoon?
1 : lost lagoon is lost.
2 : lost lagoon.
2 : ok.
1 : and
2 : umm.
3 : and what was the other one?
2 : breaker's
2 : bridge
2 : where's that?
2 : there it is.
2 : alright, that's it for me.
3 : ok.
3 : alright so
3 : i'm gonna shore this up
1 : no we need you to give that, we need you to give me this
3 : ok.
1 : this turn
3 : i no no
1 : but you have to be
1 : you need to be on my square though
1 : so
3 : umm
3 : if on same
1 : you can shore
1 : so i think you can shore up one of these then fly over to me then give me one
2 : yeah
3 : alright, it's a good thing you got all that done
1 : s
1 : so i think shore up the
3 : alright this one or this one?
1 : shore up this one cause it's a treasure
3 : mmhmm
3 : one.
1 : then fly to me
1 : two.
3 : two.
1 : and then give me
2 : and then card
1 : that
3 : three
1 : alright and i have to get rid of
1 : get rid of the yellow one?
2 : umm.
1 : cause this one we don't have four of right now.
2 : yeah let's do that
3 : mmhmm.
1 : so
1 : get rid of that
1 : alright.
3 : ah
3 : and then i can use the helicopter lift and get you
3 : over here since you got all four
1 : no i'm supposed to be here
1 : i have to be here. this is when we have all when we have
3 : oh but then d oh we all have to go
2 : yeah
2 : that's when we have all of them yeah
1 : but you should use your helicopter lift and go somewhere.
1 : umm.
1 : because you're gonna have six cards after you draw
2 : yeah you're gonna have to
3 : alright then i should
2 : umm.
3 : move some place where i can shore up one of these
1 : so maybe go like here where you can shore something up but you aren't in danger of drowing.
3 : alright
3 : or
3 : this one?
1 : or actually wait you can go on top, yeah i like that
3 : or
3 : do we need this one?
2 : we have
2 : i think this one
1 : yeah i think go here go here
3 : ok why this one?
2 : yeah.
1 : cause it doesn't matter if this sinks
1 : cause we're still gonna have
1 : this tile to get rid of our
2 : we just have to be careful because whispering garden is in the top
1 : our winds
3 : right.
2 : so
3 : yeah.
1 : but the thing is like it does like if she goes here and it goes under she just ends up here anyway it's like fine.
2 : ok.
1 : so there's just like a slight maybe benefit maybe.
3 : alright.
2 : yeah.
1 : but you can't
1 : shore it up
2 : we'll see
3 : d wait, wait do i have to
1 : you can't shore it up, you're out of actions
3 : there
2 : yeah.
1 : so it's
3 : ok
2 : yeah.
1 : here and then here
2 : alright and then two treasures
1 : alright.
1 : yep
3 : hey you got another helicopter lift
3 : two of these good.
1 : the helicopter came
3 : alright, i need three floods.
1 : here you go
3 : what
3 : copper gate, howling gardens
3 : and cliffs of abandon
2 : alright, so that one's
1 : ok.
2 : that one's gone.
2 : cliffs
3 : alright, we need that, that's a possibility
2 : and then
3 : this one too
1 : oh well.
2 : ok.

1 : yeah wait, alright, i so
1 : if you go one
3 : if he moves there
1 : shore it up and then move here
1 : then we're super safe and then she can just give those to you instead of you to her
1 : cause you're on the same square
2 : she can only give me one.

2 : and then three.
2 : alright, temple of the moon, tidal palace
2 : and
2 : dunes of desertion
3 : tidal palace
2 : that's tidal ok
2 : alright, your turn.
3 : ok.
3 : ultimately i have to get us all.
3 : over here now.
2 : yeah we have here and then we have the have a helicopter lift.
3 : alright.
3 : first action.
1 : yeah
1 : yeah that's good.

1 : that's me.
3 : oh.
1 : oh ah well you can use the helicopter lift though
3 : yeah.
1 : oh i think you should
3 : no, no, i think we all wanna end up over here.
2 : umm
1 : wait, i think so, i think the plan is if you just fly to me right now, that's two.
2 : yeah.
1 : and then you can just shore one up or something
1 : and then when it's my turn
1 : i'll lift us back over
1 : cause we can us-we can use the lift at any time actually
2 : well we have three
2 : we have have three so
3 : we have three helicopter lifts
1 : yeah so we have plenty of time i think just
1 : fly over and shore up like
1 : dunes of deception or something
1 : and then
2 : we might as well just do this one
1 : well that's two, so you can only shore up one of them
2 : yeah
1 : and then
3 : i guess i'm just wondering if we
2 : umm
1 : if
3 : we don't really
1 : what i'm thinking is if we end up on the same square then we win instantly when it's his turn
3 : mmhmm.
3 : mmhmm.
1 : cause
1 : he takes the treasure
1 : then i helicopter lift us both over there
1 : then you helicopter lift us over there and then you lift a third time
3 : ok.
2 : yeah
3 : that's two.
3 : this one?
1 : that's
1 : sure.
2 : yeah.
3 : three.
3 : and another sandbag
3 : and chalice
2 : 
2 : i think you can just get rid of both of those
3 : this
1 : just
1 : used it, you can use the
2 : or one
3 : well we can just use this
2 : or yeah
1 : sandbag right now

3 : and
1 : just to be safe
1 : just
3 : i know it doesn't really matter
1 : bag up any ran yeah any random one.

1 : so i guess we won.
3 : mmhmm.
2 : alright.
2 : yeah.
1 : and with five minutes to spare
2 : water's rise
3 : he still has to do yeah
1 : no we can you can lift right now you can lift when it's not your turn
