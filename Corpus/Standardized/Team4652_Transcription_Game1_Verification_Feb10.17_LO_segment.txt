1 : ok
1 : umm
1 : so
1 : what do you guys think i should do? i guess we should look at each other's
4 : umm, well you do have you have two of the chalices
4 : so that could be
2 : i think you wanna start shoring up some
4 : you can
1 : yeah
2 : some places
4 : being, being that you're the engineer.  to kinda put that power to work, yeah
1 : ok
1 : umm, so i can go well i can only cause these two are the only adjacent ones to me
4 : right
2 : right
1 : ok so i can do
1 : those two
2 : that would be one turn. or one move, rather one action
1 : yeah
4 : one action, yup.
1 : umm
4 : you can move and then shore up again
4 : would be all your three actions.
1 : oh yeah
2 : mmhmm
1 : that's a good idea
1 : two
1 : and then three.
2 : good.
4 : two treasure cards
1 : ok, so water's rise
4 : mm good start
1 : and
1 : one of the fire
1 : crystal fire
4 : ok so you've already got one of those.
1 : yes
4 : just planning ahead.
4 : alright
1 : ok
2 : wait
4 : and then, two flood cards.
2 : we have to put these guys at back in here
1 : yeah
4 : you had those out from
1 : mm this goes over there
4 : yeah
2 : goes to the discard
3 : and then take your flood cards
2 : we pick two flood cards
1 : ok, lost lagoon and gold gate
4 : well
4 : you wanna pass me the gold gate?
4 : it's gone
4 : that's not too bad
2 : one, two, three
2 : ok we didn't lose one of these guys. that's what i was asking
3 : messenger
1 : was there anything on the gold ok
4 : no,
4 : no it was just
4 : and at the
4 : default for one of the yellow whatever that is
1 : ok
2 : alright
4 : so yeah
2 : alright here we go
2 : alright let's see here
4 : one, two
4 : no
2 : 
4 : is that
4 : l ok, lost lagoon, maybe you'd wanna get towards that and shore that up
2 : ok
4 : umm just because there's not
2 : one, two
2 : that's fine
4 : really any other
4 : goal for you at the moment.
2 : cause i could go here for one and then here to two and then i could shore it up with three.
4 : although
4 : yeah.
4 : unless anyone has a better idea. the other thing would be maybe if you wanna try starting to collect the
2 : the red card?
4 : the red ones.
2 : or the yellow ones. one of the two
4 : yeah
4 : umm
1 : umm
4 : i'd say don't wo i would go ahead and
2 : well lost lagoon doesn't really have anything on it, so
4 : well
4 : that's a good point too actually.
2 : so if i come over to the red
2 : that would be one move and then we could do
2 : two would be she could
4 : she can't give you a card
3 : mmhmm
3 : you would give your red card
2 : i have to give a card oh i have to give a card. ok so
1 : it has to be on my yeah
2 : i could give
2 : you my,
2 : my lion
3 : that would be a good card that would be a better move
4 : yeah and then i can try to get over here eventually
2 : and then i could, and then i could move another spot closer to the red and then maybe i could collect
4 : yeah so
1 : yeah
4 : well do you need to be,
2 : the r
4 : do you need to be on top of my
2 : oh yeah, so i'd have to move over. sorry
4 : yeah so that would, that would be one, two, three.
3 : as the messenger i don't think she has to be
4 : oh yeah what's your specific power though?
2 : i can give a card to anyone
2 : i can give a card at any time for one of my actions so i don't even have to be on a
4 : oh, ok
2 : thing. so i could actually
4 : yeah
2 : i could almost give two cards away, but
4 : give me that one
2 : that'll do.
4 : and then you can
2 : there's one
3 : and then take a move, so one action
4 : one
4 : and then start moving over towards
2 : i can move
4 : either of these.
2 : i can move towards breaker's bridge. go one, two
4 : sure
3 : ok
2 : alright
1 : ok
2 : two treasure cards
2 : sandbag
2 : and another one of those
3 : hmm
4 : oh ok so you can
2 : lions
4 : give that next time.
2 : and then
2 : yeah. ok, and then we got
2 : two of these.
2 : got phantom rock
3 : it's here. that's gonna sink
2 : well that's gone.
4 : alright.
2 : and then temple
2 : on the moon.
3 : yeah
2 : or of the moon, rather. sorry
4 : ok that one's important.
3 : that's
3 : on the red.
4 : and we wanna keep track of what's in that
4 : little pile before we recycle it
2 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
4 : or
4 : put them on top.
3 : mk
4 : alright
4 : that's it right?
2 : yeah
2 : yup that's me.
3 : alright
4 : k
2 : it's your turn, pilot.
3 : pilot turn
3 : oh i think i might need to go to the temple of the moon and shore that up since i can
3 : fly.
3 : once per turn.
4 : you could. you could also just kinda
1 : yeah
4 : double down on that and just try to use this one.
3 : what do you mean?
4 : like even, even if that one goes away, we still have that.
1 : cause there's not a
3 : mm
3 : oh
3 : oh true.
4 : but it that doesn't really matter because you're, you're right you can fly anywhere so distance doesn't really play in.
4 : you could use the lift to move anyone else
3 : mmhmm
4 : if there's a good place for somebody else to move.
2 : i think you should hold onto that for now.
4 : yeah
4 : i agree
2 : umm
2 : i would think that since we don't have any cards, enough cards to pick up a treasure
2 : that we should shore up as many of these
4 : mmhmm
2 : cards as we can because
2 : especially the temple of the moon because if you start losing cards in the middle you're gonna start losing places to swim to.
3 : mmhmm
4 : it'd be good to have
1 : yeah
4 : now is there any disdvantage to losing a card like this? like it might e-even be in our best interest just to like lose the useless ones on the outside, yeah.
1 : let it happen
2 : right, that's why i was saying
2 : the one in the middle i think we should shore up rather than
4 : yeah
4 : right, right
2 : than
3 : ok
4 : so that's, that would be two actions. move, shore up
3 : so one action and shore up, correct?
3 : and then i have an action left but i don't have to necessarily take an action.
4 : you don't need to, yeah.
4 : umm
3 : why don't
4 : unless you wanna try to
4 : get ready to give this
4 : i would, yeah
4 : i would say not worry about it.
2 : you could
2 : yeah you could just stay where you are.
1 : yeah
1 : cause you're already there.
4 : cool
3 : ok
2 : alright
2 : take your two treasure cards then
3 : mm, let's see what we get today
4 : k, so we wanna get that to you eventually and then helicopters.
1 : perfect
3 : and then, two waters please.
3 : city or cliffs of abandon
3 : and breaker's
3 : bridge.
4 : breaker's bridge is here
3 : close
4 : yeah
3 : i was here.
4 : alright so those in particular we definitely want to keep
4 : shored up.
2 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
3 : ok
4 : ok
4 : umm
2 : i guess
3 : umm
4 : so
4 : now you, you can only deliv like use your messenger power during your turn, right?
2 : that's right, that's one of my actions.
4 : ok, ok.
2 : mmhmm
4 : i can start moving
4 : towards one of these.
4 : or, or being, well being the explorer i can use my power to
2 : mm mm mm
2 : what's your power?
3 : you can move diagonal
4 : i can, i can move, yeah diagonally and
3 : that's cool
2 : you could shore up diagonally too right?
4 : so i could, i could move here
4 : shore that up and then shore that up would be my three actions.
2 : yup
4 : and then i can still get here quickly.
2 : i think that
2 : -s a good idea.
4 : alrighty
3 : ok
2 : where do you want breaker's bridge?
4 : oh, yeah, sorry.
2 : so
4 : uh and then two treasure cards
4 : thanks
4 : alright
3 : wait are you green or gray?
4 : green
2 : he's green, i'm gray.
3 : ok
4 : i, i moved here to flip that and then i didn't move her back afterwards.
3 : ok
2 : so you're at your max with five
2 : ok
1 : yes
4 : right
3 : ok
4 : should try to get rid of the ones i don't need.
1 : yes
4 : whispering garden and iron gate.
3 : iron gate
4 : iron gate we don't really need to worry about
3 : no
1 : ok
1 : umm so i need to try and get close to one of the
1 : ocean things.
4 : the two of us have ocean
4 : things.
2 : so you're red
2 : who's, who's you're blue. pilot right?
1 : yeah
3 : yes
4 : we're basically all on top of each other
2 : can you guys give each other anything or can you give him no
1 : well you have to
2 : never mind
3 : she can give away a card, or cards.
2 : if you want me to correct the,
2 : collect the fire you can move onto mine and collect the fire
2 : and shore up the lost lagoon.
1 : umm
2 : or
2 : you could do something different
4 : maybe
1 : wait, i'm sorry. do you have to be umm
1 : on
1 : one of the
1 : like
1 : like do i have to be here to give this to you or can i just give this to you?
2 : no you have to be on the same
1 : the same one as you?
3 : s
2 : the you have to be on the same space as me, to give it to me.
3 : space as her
4 : right
1 : oh ok.
1 : ok
4 : the other thing would be if we can try to shorten the total number of turns it takes to get these, that's better.
1 : oh that complicates things
4 : so
4 : mm you could
4 : try to give those two to me.
4 : by the time it gets around to you, you could give one to that to me
4 : and then
4 : i could on my turn
1 : collect it.
4 : go on two and collect that.
3 : collect the treasure.
1 : yeah
4 : just cause if we, if we try to wait for it to go all the way around again, that's more
1 : time consuming.
3 : s it might something might sink.
4 : it's more time consuming and more flooding.
1 : yeah
4 : except i would need to get rid of these.
2 : when you, yeah when you get five and you get another one you have to discard one.
4 : cause i have five, we didn't think of that.
3 : mm
4 : right
4 : ok, we didn't think of that.
3 : so maybe
3 : maybe she should hold onto her chalice cards and then we give them to her?
4 : yeah
2 : and she could work towards
2 : down here
1 : yeah, that's what i was thinking
4 : one, two, three
1 : initially.
2 : cause if you are cause if you came here
4 : i would maybe you could do one, two, three to get there
2 : you could give
4 : then on your turn
4 : you can go up,
4 : give your, give your chalice to her,
4 : i can
4 : go up too and give the chalice to her, and then i'm still only one away from the gardens,
4 : if we would wanna try to use these
4 : later on.
2 : ok
1 : ok
4 : does that make sense?
2 : mmhmm
3 : mm
1 : so umm
1 : should i move
1 : over here so that i can give this to you
1 : and then so that i
4 : what?
1 : cause if i'm gonna receive those two i have to make sure i don't
1 : have five cards cause when i draw those i could collect one.
2 : mmhmm
4 : also a good point, yeah.
1 : ok so i'm gonna do that
1 : as one.
2 : wait
4 : that's one
2 : that's one
4 : give it to her, and then just move one closer.
1 : and this is two
3 : ok
1 : yeah
1 : and then three
3 : alright
4 : cool
1 : ok
1 : and then those two
4 : mm
1 : water's rise
3 : hmm
4 : ok
1 : umm ok so this comes up one so now we're at three
1 : and we
1 : put those back
1 : and also i got one of these guys.
3 : we'll need to
3 : shuffle those.
1 : umm
1 : ok that's a lot of them
1 : but none of them are coral palace.
1 : and then this comes back over there
4 : which, which in particular in there are
4 : flooded right? whispering garden is in there
3 : and that one
2 : mmhmm
1 : whispering garden is one
1 : umm
4 : might just use that one anyway
2 : all the ones that are currently flooded are in this pile
4 : ok
2 : 
1 : but there's also ones that are
4 : that makes sense plus some others.
1 : yeah, like this guy i think, but none of them are this one.
2 : except for 
2 : right
1 : i believe
3 : hmm
4 : alright
4 : that's not too bad then
2 : alright and you need to pick up your three cards
1 : k
1 : oh yes
1 : thank you
1 : ok
1 : so, breaker's bridge, lost lagoon, and iron gate. ok so lost lagoon is gone
4 : iron gate is gone
1 : iron gate is gone, ok so that's not a huge
2 : and what was the other one?
1 : lost.
1 : umm, breaker's bridge
1 : however
2 : where's breaker's bridge?
2 : right here.
4 : right there
1 : the umm
1 : so like you said now that those two are gone those cards are also out so now it increases the likelihood that we're gonna draw something that'll be like of consequence
3 : mmhmm
1 : and lose it.
2 : yeah
4 : that's a great point.
2 : i still have sandbags we can use sandbags too.
4 : and that can do anywhere, right?
2 : this can be at any time.
4 : ok
3 : and at any time, yes
1 : what does that do?
2 : 
2 : i can shore up any tile on the island. i can play it at any time
4 : you need to shore it up
2 : does not count as any action
2 : and you just discard it over there, so i mean
1 : ok, so it's just to shore up something but it's not a bring an island back to life card.
2 : we c
2 : right, we could shh
2 : right we can shore up whispering gardens at any time. you know, whatever
1 : ok
1 : ok
2 : al
2 : alright so it's my turn now so
2 : let's see.
2 : i want
4 : wanna try to go
2 : do i wanna give you my
2 : my yellow lion and get rid of the
3 : uh well
2 : purple
1 : well he can't
3 : he already has five
4 : i can just get rid of one of these, you know i
1 : accept anymore cards.
2 : yeah you'd have to discard the purple
3 : ok
3 : that's true, we only need three treasures
4 : yeah let's
1 : well i don't know if you get rid of them at the moment, then we're
1 : we only need three to win, right?
1 : cause i have so that's one, two, three four of the purple, and one, two, three, four of the green, and then one, two, three of the gold
3 : correct
4 : right, so we
3 : hmm
4 : yeah we could just
4 : double down and just
4 : not worry about those.
4 : might make it simpler.
1 : maybe
2 : ok i'll keep ok.
4 : have we,
4 : have we had any of the fire ones get
4 : flipped at all?
2 : nnhmm
4 : cause other thing those are probably way down in the deck
2 : maybe
1 : yeah that's true
3 : hmm
4 : umm
4 : let's not, let's well hold on
2 : and there's t, there's tons of these, so i mean we're-you're gonna get all kinds of duplicates even if you discard one you'll draw another one.
4 : yeah
4 : right.
1 : hmm
4 : ok
4 : well let's go for,
4 : let's try to do the, the earth stone
4 : the
4 : chalice here and the wind one for now.
2 : ok
4 : i think that, that would make it a little bit simpler
2 : alright
2 : would you like me to
2 : we'll see uh umm what color am i? i'm gray, ok so.
2 : i can shore up breaker's bridge
4 : k
1 : i think that's a good idea.
2 : and i can move up towards whispering gar or i can just use my sandbag and just
2 : shore up whispering garden.
4 : umm
4 : i would say save that in case we really, really need it.
2 : ok
4 : cause we still do have two of these, we still have two of all of them, so then we might wanna keep that just in case
2 : ok, i'll shore up breaker's bridge
2 : and then
2 : i can move onto
4 : shore up breaker's bridge, maybe give me one of
2 : but if i give you one then i'm getting you're either getting rid of
4 : i we would lose any of these, ok.
2 : right
2 : i don't think that that's a good idea right now.
3 : but
4 : yes and
3 : sorry to interrupt
2 : what were you thinking?
4 : no go for it
3 : we might have one of the the whispering she's gonna draw three of those flood cards. we might lose
3 : a garden,
3 : so i'm like
1 : yeah
3 : be time to use the sandbag
1 : i would say i agree i think we should use the sandbag
4 : that
1 : because there's probably
1 : like there are a ton of cards and there's probably more
1 : and right now basically right now we need this and we don't necessarily need this for something other than
1 : this
1 : because
1 : it's three
4 : you'd
4 : and you'd rather use this than just try to get that.
4 : you think it's worth
1 : well
1 : i think it's
1 : yeah
4 : ok
1 : cause this one's also in here,
2 : yeah well
4 : yeah
1 : in the recent one. so if we lose both of them and these are only gonna increase so if we lose both of them the n that's completely out for something we're already trying to work on.
4 : sure
4 : that makes sense.
2 : ok, so i'm gonna flip this guy over, but this doesn't count as one of my actions, so we can just do that and flip that one over.
4 : right
1 : yeah
3 : ok
2 : and then i can
2 : shore up this guy here.
4 : yup
2 : this would be action number one
2 : is there any place you want me to go towards?
2 : i can go towards fool's landing, i can
2 : i don't
1 : umm
4 : i don't think there's much, much of an imperative
2 : or i could come down towards howling garden in case it gets,
2 : it gets flooded. i can flip it
1 : and you have to shore it up
4 : yeah, why don't you just move one, two, so that you're next to it anyway.
1 : yeah that's a good idea.
3 : that's a good spot.
4 : and then, cool
1 : perfect
1 : ok
4 : go ahead with the treasure deck.
3 : alright
3 : ahp
3 : yeah
2 : i got another sandbag
2 : and i got another
1 : perfect
3 : uh
3 : awesome
4 : alright so now we have four of these
2 : and then i gotta
2 : pull some of these
1 : yes
2 : flooded
4 : uh
2 : cards, three of em.
3 : oh
3 : we could skip that but no
2 : cliffs of abandon
3 : oh, ok
1 : that's this guy.
2 : uh whispering garden
3 : hmm
4 : mm
2 : and
2 : temple of the moon
2 : which is under the blue one.
3 : so that one again?
3 : man
3 : alright
4 : alright
2 : you're
4 : you need to get
4 : that
4 : to her.
3 : ok
3 : that would be one action
2 : and you could f, and you could shore up both of these on with your other two actions.
3 : i can
3 : i could arbitrarily these two.
4 : 
4 : well you need to get onto her space, to give her the, the chalice.
3 : well
2 : oh
3 : no
4 : so that's now you can, you can move anywhere on the map for just one move right?
2 : one, two
3 : one
3 : yes
4 : k
2 : yeah cause you can fly anywhere
3 : ok
2 : so you could shore up both of those
3 : so i shore up here as one
3 : and then
3 : move
2 : oh right
4 : and then give her
3 : and then give her the card.
2 : mmhmm
4 : that sounds good.
2 : i think that sounds good.
3 : ok
4 : now flip that
3 : shore up
3 : fly
4 : there
2 : give her a card
3 : we need to get a
1 : thank you
3 : chalice
3 : that's three
3 : so now i get my
3 : treasure cards.
4 : now let's
4 : take it.
4 : alright
3 : and the last thing's three flood cards please
3 : copper gate,
4 : right here.
4 : it's not terribly important
3 : crimson forest,
4 : 
3 : temple of the sun.
1 : in the corner.
3 : right here
4 : alright, well that's not terrible
4 : ok so i need to get this to you and i am
1 : mmhmm
4 : ok
2 : you gotta move onto the spot with her
4 : right
4 : so i'll just do that first.
4 : that's one,
4 : that's two
1 : two
4 : and then
4 : i could shore up cliffs of abandon
4 : but there might be better
4 : actually not a whole lot else i can do.
2 : i think you should do that cause you're gonna need it to go back up to whispering gardens and i have a sandbag we can still
3 : yeah we could
4 : if you wanna go up there
2 : shore up whispering garden at any time, so
2 : we could do both things
4 : cool
4 : k and
3 : well whispering garden's still in the discard pile. is it in threat at the moment?
2 : you shoul
1 : yeah we'll probably draw another one really soon.
2 : yes uh
4 : alright
2 : that's a good point i can hold onto it
4 : yeah
2 : ok
4 : yeah, that's three for me so i'll take two of the treasure cards.
3 : alright
4 : although i'm eh
4 : i guess i have to get rid of one.
4 : well alright, we got a water's rise, so
2 : if i can play this at any time i can play it right now and flip over whispering gardens, before you draw your uh
3 : shh
2 : your card's over here, your flood cards.
4 : yeah i don't
4 : i don't know if we can break the third wall, but
4 : their uh the rule is that
4 : you have to use this immediately and i don't know if that means you can swoop in with the sandbag
4 : umm
4 : before
2 : well, yeah but you don't, yeah but you can
2 : i don't know what the rules are but you could
4 : that's, that's kinda what i'm asking, yeah
2 : but, but that doesn't force you to draw these cards so you can finish, we can put these back in the discard, and an and before you draw all these things you can use it
4 : oh yeah, ok, ok
4 : good, i like that
2 : it doesn't say anything about
2 : play at any time it says
3 : bless
4 : right
4 : alright
1 : yeah
4 : move that up,
4 : shuffle that in,
4 : and then we'll discard that.
2 : if you wanna use my sandbag we can use the whispering gardens.
4 : umm
3 : ok yeah.
4 : d
4 : and you think you'd wanna use the sandbag rather than
4 : wait is is howling gardens in there?
2 : yes
4 : like on top? it is, ok
1 : yes
1 : so is that guy.
3 : ok
4 : temple of the sun
1 : umm
4 : we can use moon well both of those are actually in there.
4 : shh
4 : ok, we gotta alright
4 : yeah, why don't we, why don't we use the sandbag?
3 : so which one do we wanna save?
4 : that's actually a good
3 : the
3 : the garden or the sun?
2 : or we just hold onto it and just
4 : yeah, that might be the smarter bet
2 : alright
2 : alright, well then here's your
4 : three of em
2 : three cards.
4 : alright, well
3 : hmm
1 : well
1 : we lost.
4 : eh you can't win em all. cliffs of abandon and copper gate those aren't too bad.
2 : copper gate's gone
3 : copper gate's 
3 : cliffs of abandon?
4 : abandon
3 : ok
4 : oh sorry
4 : alright well
4 : take as you can get, so
2 : alright so the first thing i think you wanna do is cap well you wanna move and then capture your treasure right?
1 : yes
3 : ok
4 : yup
2 : or do you wanna
2 : wait, you're red right?
1 : yes
4 : shore up, move, capture.
2 : so you could shore up and them move and then capture youre treasure. you could shore up cliffs of abandon
1 : yeah
4 : that sounds good.
2 : is that what you were thinking?
1 : yeah
3 : one
2 : and then move would be two and then three would be capture the treasure.
3 : two
1 : k so i discard these guys.
4 : alright
3 : oh
2 : yay one down
3 : one down, two to go
1 : ok
4 : ok now
2 : here's your
2 : do you wanna do something else?
4 : i'm just thinking about using that sandbag if we need it, but i think because that's not
4 : flooding
2 : we still need the sandbag we can only use on crimson forest which at this point is completely out of
1 : or temple of the sun
1 : and i think that we should do it
2 : or temple of the sun
4 : right
4 : so we don't do so we don't lose that.
1 : because we're closer
3 : to getting four
1 : two well i guess
1 : at this point it depends who it is but like
1 : these two are
1 : umm close to this one and these two are close to this one. they're both two spaces away.
1 : umm
2 : this one's closer to fool's landing
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
4 : uh why don't we do it?
2 : let's do it
2 : alright, here's your umm
2 : two treasure cards
1 : thank you
1 : ok cool
1 : so i got another one of these
1 : and a helicopter
4 : k so we have plenty of these we also have plenty of helicopter lifts, we should start
3 : 
1 : so
2 : you have helicopters. we can move people around. and you need your three
3 : uh uh uh true
1 : yeah
2 : floods
3 : and they can be played at anytime
4 : right
2 : mmhmm
4 : and we do have
4 : bunch of people on the same
4 : and you can use that to move multiple people.
3 : true
1 : ok so we got temple of the sun
2 : what'd you get?
1 : uh temple of the moon
4 : oh
3 : mm
1 : and breaker's bridge
4 : alright
4 : that's not too bad.
2 : except these two are both flooded.
1 : yeah
2 : if we wanna go after those
3 : we do have four
1 : i think we should
3 : cards out.
2 : alright
3 : four
1 : umm i have three
4 : well, total, we have enough of these.
3 : one on the same yeah we have enough to capture i assume
2 : alright
1 : oh
1 : yeah
4 : umm
1 : we do.
4 : so
4 : you should use
4 : also the all of these are useless from now on so once we get em we can just
2 : yup so i can
1 : yes
4 : so if you wanna get
1 : get rid of them.
4 : i can
2 : i can shore up some stuff.
1 : i think you should
4 : yeah
2 : and i can give a card away too.
4 : i would say give maybe
4 : two of the
2 : i
4 : two of the statues to me
2 : i can do that
1 : can you discard your
1 : green thing, like anytime?
4 : yeah
2 : yeah well when i give him a card he can discard it.
4 : there's no reason to, but i'll just get rid of it.
3 : when you get some more cards
1 : yeah ok
1 : so i think you should do that
4 : and then i'll just get rid of one of these unfortunately.
1 : yeah i think that's ok
1 : because if you
4 : ok
1 : if each of you give one of those to me
1 : if we are since we're all close right now and then on my next turn i move and get that guy that's another one as long as we can keep that from sinking.
4 : that's three.
4 : yup, i like that.
2 : we don't have anymore sandbags.
4 : well we'll just have to see what happens.
2 : alright
1 : that is true
4 : so if you wanna use your messenger power
2 : ok
4 : and get those two gold statues to me
2 : yup
2 : that's two actions, mmhmm
4 : and that's two of your actions, right? ok
2 : and then the other option is is
4 : and then we'll discard those for me
3 : mmhmm
2 : i you could f someone could fly me over there cause that doesn't count as an action right, the helicopter?
2 : and i could use my third action to save,
2 : to save this guy.
3 : sure
1 : yeah i think that's a good idea.
1 : i'll do it.
2 : ok
1 : because we know in the next within the next round we're gonna get that as long as we keep that from
3 : i'd save
2 : mm mm
4 : it's gonna be gone, yeah.
1 : sinking.
2 : right
1 : so i think we should do that.
4 : cool
2 : alright
3 : did you already draw? ok
2 : no i haven't yet. alright i got ha now i have four
1 : oh
2 : little fire things.
4 : and we still have a lift so we could
3 : and we have a helicopter
2 : and then
2 : yeah let me grab these guys here
2 : i guess
4 : as long as we can survive that long
1 : yeah
2 : alright here we go
3 : yes
2 : silver gate,
2 : that's up there.
4 : that's a new one.
2 : tidal palace
2 : it's over there.
2 : but we already have that
4 : yeah that's, that's not bad.
2 : so that's, that's ok
2 : and crimson forest
1 : bye
2 : oh, there you go.
4 : this is exciting.
1 : yes
3 : alright
2 : alright pilot
3 : so i need to give this
1 : to me
2 : are you guys on the same
3 : to the ex engineer. no we're not
4 : to your right?
1 : which which one's yours?
2 : you're the blue
3 : i'm blue
1 : ok
2 : so you would have to move here for one
1 : so you should move one
2 : and then you'd have to give her two
3 : ok
1 : thank you
3 : good plan
2 : and if you're gonna go after this guy on your next turn
2 : and you're gonna go on your next turn
4 : i can move, give it to her, then move
2 : then the next thing would be to get off the island, right?
4 : yeah
3 : so i can make a move
2 : or you could
2 : well you can fly anywhere so you could go
3 : either way
2 : somewhere and
3 : well i wouldn't be able to shore it up
2 : right
3 : cause i already took two actions, but i could
3 : i could go there
3 : to shore it up next time.
2 : if something would happen
3 : if i'm still,
1 : which one?
3 : if we're still
1 : to where?
2 : he could shore
3 : to any, any of the flooded ones
2 : to anywhere
4 : umm
4 : the most important one would be
4 : actually none of i mean
1 : noi
1 : i don't think so, i think
4 : none of those are really imperative
3 : cause we're gonna fly
3 : the engineer to
3 : wherever 
2 : you could just go to fool's landing
3 : i can just go there
2 : or,
4 : umm
4 : i we don't we wanna make sure
2 : or would you just rather him stay put?
1 : yeah i think you should
4 : we wanna make sure we keep this too.
1 : do that.
1 : yeah
3 : mm
2 : mmhmm
3 : true
1 : so you might wanna go there
2 : but you're going there on the next turn anyways
4 : yeah, un i mean, i can either go there and get it which is probably what we'll do but then i won't be able to get this to her,
4 : although we do have lift.
3 : mm
2 : mmhmm
4 : but we can only use one though, cause we need to keep one.
1 : for getting to fool's landing
3 : to get off
4 : let lift be there
1 : oh to get off
4 : ok we can use that to get me here, i can get it, i can move back
2 : mmhmm, mm
4 : and then i can give that to you.
2 : mmhmm
4 : so that's three, ok so
2 : right
3 : i can just stay put
4 : that's
4 : yeah.
2 : ok
4 : why don't we just do that?
3 : mk
1 : ok
3 : stay put, take two cards
4 : nobody has more than five, right?
3 : lion and the rock
1 : no
2 : nope
3 : and then three flood cards
3 : bronze gate,
3 : cave of shadows,
3 : umm
4 : cave of shadows
2 : right here
1 : this one
3 : and then dunes of deception down in the corner.
3 : alright
4 : alright
4 : not too bad.
3 : you may only have i have six cards
2 : oh
4 : oh wait we weren't counting those. ok, get rid of the
4 : fire one
2 : get
2 : get rid of the fire or the yeah the fire one
4 : one, two, three, four, five, alright
1 : yeah
3 : sounds good
2 : thank you
2 : i forgot the helicopters counted.
4 : are we fine yeah
4 : alright umm so my turn we want to use one of the helicopters to get me here
3 : me too
2 : yup
4 : and that's not an action
2 : yup
3 : correct
4 : and then i'll get this
4 : discard those
3 : mm
4 : second action, move here, third action, give that to you.
2 : good
4 : k
2 : that's good, alright.
3 : yes no water rise
4 : misty marsh, howling garden,
4 : which we don't
4 : need anymore. and cave of embers
3 : ok
2 : alright
4 : k so we wanna
1 : ok so now i just
2 : we wanna move i think one, two, right?
3 : move two

3 : actions?
3 : alright
3 : right now.
4 : yeah we got, we got three.
1 : is there any reason we can't go right now?
2 : we'd have to, i think we'd have to move all of our pieces there and then, and then we'd have to helicopter lift off.
4 : we have to move there.
1 : we all have to be there?
1 : it's not just one of us? ok
3 : do you did you say you got a helicopter?
4 : right
2 : uh
1 : yes

2 : little
2 : ticker thing up one.
1 : we're still at three.
4 : one, two, one, two
3 : alright
4 : as long as we don't lose fool's landing
2 : well fool's landing hasn't even it's still in the pile down there so we're still good.
4 : in this next
4 : yeah, i guess you're right.
2 : it's tough once that comes up, i would think.
4 : yeah, we kinda lucked out.
