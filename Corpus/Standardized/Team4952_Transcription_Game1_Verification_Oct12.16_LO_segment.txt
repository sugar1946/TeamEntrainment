1 : ok
2 : ok
1 : so i think moving to the temple of the moon would be my first action.
3 : yeah that makes sense.
1 : shore it up and then shore up cliffs abandon and breakless breaker's bridge.
2 : yeah
3 : mmhmm
4 : cool
1 : move
1 : shore up
1 : and
4 : oh yeah cause you can do two.
1 : shore up
3 : mmhmm
1 : yeah
2 : good work
1 : and then two treasure cards.
1 : thank you
1 : water's rise. that was fast.
1 : ok
1 : 
1 : these get
1 : shuffled.
2 : i could take those for you, put it over here
1 : put back on top
1 : and then i take two
1 : so breaker's bridge
1 : goes back under
1 : and the gold gate
2 : ok so that gets sunk
1 : ok
4 : that was also fast.
2 : ok
2 : ok so
2 : i think my first action i'm gonna give you my statue of the wind.
3 : you have to be on the same tile i think.
2 : no cause i'm the messenger so i can give it to anyone.
1 : she's the messenger.
3 : oh there you go.
4 : oh
2 : umm so we're gonna do that
4 : thanks
2 : and then
2 : ok
2 : i guess i'll just make
2 : two
2 : moves cause that's really the only other thing that i see beneficial so one
4 : mmhmm
1 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : that's three actions
2 : take two cards
4 : can only the messenger give away these
2 : everyone can but i can give them to anywhere, anyone. all of you can only give them away
4 : cards?
3 : yeah we have to be in the same tile and then we can do it for one action.
1 : we have to be on the same tile.
2 : if there and then
4 : got it ok thanks
2 : two flood cards, so temple of the moon
2 : and phantom rock
1 : oh no
4 : uh oh
3 : phantom rock's gone is all.
2 : ah yes yup
1 : wow
2 : at least they're on the outside.
4 : yeah
3 : yeah
3 : alright umm
3 : i guess
3 : you can go over there did you
1 : shore things up
3 : prevent it from yeah
2 : yeah i would do that
3 : i'll go over here
1 : mmhmm
3 : and then i'll shore
3 : these two as my two 
2 : ah you know what i would shore the two that are kinda on the inside. cause like if the outside falls  that's that's kinda alright.
3 : ok that's fine.
4 : mm that's a good idea.
3 : that's fine so i'll shore both of those up
4 : mmhmm
3 : as my
3 : second
3 : and third action.
2 : awesome
4 : ooo two helicopters
1 : nice
2 : nice, perfect.
3 : mmhmm
3 : and two can you lift them
2 : two of these.
3 : cliffs of abandon
2 : we got that for you. alright that one's gone.
3 : and lost lagoon
1 : lost lagoon is gone
4 : ok
2 : alright
1 : ok
4 : ok my turn
4 : umm
4 : maybe i go here
4 : and then
4 : i could
4 : oh never mind we have the chalice
2 : wait you can take you can take a card for me though
1 : but you can still
4 : yeah oh i'll take the lion from you
2 : so perfect
3 : can you take as well as give?
2 : yeah
2 : cause you can't or oh, it's give a treasure card, i lied.
4 : oh
2 : sorry
4 : darn
4 : ok
1 : but you can still move toward the howling garden or the whispering garden so that
1 : so you're prepared when you get all four.
2 : yeah that's a good idea.
4 : ok
4 : where is it?
2 : i would move up to misty marsh.
1 : south
1 : either north or south
4 : oh i see ok so that w that was my first move right?
2 : mmhmm or well you moved one and then you flipped the tile, so that's three
4 : so
1 : you did two cause you moved and then flipped.
4 : ok
2 : and then
4 : and two
4 : so i got
4 : so i have
4 : five
4 : thank you
4 : whispering garden
2 : let's be on the look out for that one
3 : no
4 : and iron gate
2 : alright
4 : ok
2 : cool
1 : ok
2 : alrighty
1 : so
1 : let's see i should maybe move toward the whispering garden to shore it up.
2 : yeah
4 : mmhmm
1 : and keep that safe, so one, two
1 : three
4 : nice
1 : and then two treasure cards thank you
2 : ah
1 : ah
1 : again
2 :  at three now, oh no.
1 : yeah
4 : yeah
4 : is there a way to make that stop or go down again?
2 : i don't think so
3 : i don't think so
4 : no? ok
1 : that would be too easy
1 : ok so three of these
2 : oh that's painful
1 : who's going down this time?
4 : i know
1 : breaker's bridge
2 : braker's bridge is ok
1 : cliffs of abandon
2 : where's cliffs of abandon
1 : and the temple of the moon
2 : where's cliffs of abandon? oh right there. ok that's
4 : there you go
2 : that's not the worst thing that could have happened.
3 : yeah
3 : we're all near all of those.
4 : right
2 : ok
1 : ok
2 : good? alright.
1 : yup
2 : i'm gonna give you, there's my one.
4 : thank you
4 : oh i have to discard one though.
2 : discard, ooo
1 : ooo
4 : cause i can only have five at once.
2 : discard your
1 : wait if you're on the same tile as me can you give me one right now as a discard? ok.
3 : no cause it's her turn.
2 : no
4 : only on my turn.
2 : hmm umm
1 : ok
3 : you just have to
2 : discard the chalice
3 : yeah i think that makes sense.
4 : yeah
2 : does it go in th uh here then? ok and then umm
3 : in here yeah.
3 : mmhmm
2 : so that was my first move, here's my second.
2 : and yeah i'm gonna sit and this will be my third. perfect.
3 : i'd do that one cause
4 : yeah
4 : cause that's an important one
2 : can i have two?
4 : oh two sandbags are out
2 : perfect. nice and now i select three.
1 : nice
2 : ok temple of the moon
4 : can you use a sandbag
4 : after you
4 : pick up
4 : one of these ah
2 : if they're in here you can't use it
3 : you, we can't look at the card before we sandbag it
2 : whispering garden
1 : again?
4 : ok
2 : and iron gate.
2 : ok iron gate's gone.
3 : alright
3 : umm
4 : alright
3 : so
3 : i'm gonna
3 : wanna shore that up but i feel like cards should be moving.
3 : ah
3 : ah whatever
3 : i'll shore this up for my first action.
3 : and i'll move over here
3 : and shore this up
2 : good call
4 : mmhmm
2 : alright two cards
3 : mmhmm
3 : i have to discard now. i have to discard one of these.
3 : ah
2 : discard the chalice, ooo no.
3 : umm you shouldn't
4 : i know, i was just thinking
2 : mm
1 : discard the statue of the wind because we have four in play
2 : yeah
2 : yeah
3 : oh we already have four in play?
2 : cool
4 : yeah
3 : ok
3 : yeah you can give that one
2 : no this one.
3 : and her whenever you want huh? yeah, yeah, yeah so i should discard this one.
2 : th this one yup, mmhmm, ok.
2 : there it goes
3 : alright
3 : tidal palace
3 : copper gate
2 : right there
3 : and crimson forest
2 : alright
2 : good to go.
4 : ok
4 : so
4 : i'm thinking that
4 : if i get rid of one, like give this to you then you can give the lion to me.
1 : mmhmm
3 : yeah next time? yeah without the
4 : on your turn?
1 : mmhmm
3 : getting rid of it?
4 : yeah alright so that's one.
1 : ok
4 : then we should
4 : mm i guess we're far away from that. well i guess i can just do diagonal.
2 : maybe shore
3 : well you want to be close to this right?
4 : right?
2 : yeah i would i would shore up, i would shore up crimson forest and copper gate cause you can shore up diagonally.
3 : so we can eventually capture.
4 : mm you're right.
1 : yeah i'll shore up
4 : that's right
1 : mm
2 : as two turn
4 : at the same time
2 : it would just yup
4 : like as one and then two yeah
4 : ok thanks
1 : so was that two or three then?
4 : i think that was three cause i gave one and then two three
3 : yeah cause he gave you
2 : yeah ok yup you're two and
1 : ok
3 : she gave you one
4 : and i need
3 : yeah
4 : two
3 : and then your next turn you'll move there after you have those yeah
2 : three
4 : right and then get
4 : and then we'll get our thing
4 : alright
4 : ehh
1 : oh no
2 : ah ok
4 : water's rise
4 : challenge
4 : i discard
2 : is everyone confident with that shuffling? alright now you get three.
4 : i'm a little nervous. as long as it's not the palace? ooo
2 : i know
2 : ooo
4 : it is whispering garden! ah
4 : again
2 : alright that's ok.
3 : well it's ok it didn't sink.
4 : and temple of the sun
2 : temple of the sun, oh no it's temple of the moon
2 : temple of the sun, oh here we go.
1 : down there
4 : ok
4 : ah that's important.
4 : and crimson forest
2 : crimson forest, ok that's not bad. cool, cool.
4 : ok
1 : ok
4 : yeah
1 : alright
1 : so
1 : i can move up and save these two
2 : yeah
3 : you don't even have to move it right?
4 : yeah
1 : ah well i have to if i want to save the diagonal one
3 : ok wait you can
4 : yeah cause he's not diagonal.
3 : you cou just that one
3 : i don't
3 : do you think that saving crimson forest was really that
1 : mm
4 : actually that's a good point.
3 : big a deal
1 : that is true yeah
2 : yeah maybe just shore up the one
1 : so
1 : take this as one
2 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
2 : get yourself to near like temple of the moon or near one of the ones with the chalice.
1 : two, three
1 : mmhmm
2 : since you've got two of each
4 : actually both of them are
4 : flooded and you have
2 : mmhmm. well we've got temple of the moon there and coral palace here as well.
4 : yeah that's all good.
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
1 : alright so i'll move toward the tidal palace.
2 : yup
3 : i think so
4 : yeah
1 : alright so that'll be two and three.
4 : yup
1 : ok, two of these.
4 : so long as it doesn't flood right now.
2 : yeah really.
4 : i mean disappear whatever that's called.
1 : alright so we have two helicopter lifts in place. i'll discard
1 : mine. does that seem wise?
2 : what else do you have?
1 : ah
3 : yeah i think that should be fine
1 : two chalice
2 : umm
1 : three earth stone
4 : i don't
4 : if we can keep a helicopter lift it seems like that's
1 : prudent
2 : yeah
4 : yeah
1 : ok
1 : so
4 : of course
1 : two and two
3 : we can you can yeah like
2 : i would yeah
3 : because we have these two yeah
1 : yeah that can work ok
2 : yeah that's good cool
1 : alright and then
1 : three of those thank you
2 : three
1 : cliffs of abandon
1 : once again
1 : and breaker's bridge gone.
2 : oh breaker's bridge is gone.
1 : with the card and the copper gate.
2 : copper gate is here cool. ok so here's
4 : ok once again we're alright, we're skating through.
1 : ok
3 : so we could also
3 : like if
3 : if we'll if we need them we could use those sandbags eventually like before these guys sink.
2 : yeah yup, there's that for you. ok so that's my one.
1 : mmhmm
4 : oh that's true.
4 : yay
3 : and then you have to discard one of yours
4 : oh yeah
4 : uh
4 : which one?
3 : umm
2 : mm
1 : pick one
2 : i would say, i would say the, i would say the moon.
3 : yeah
4 : it doesn't matter really, the moon
4 : ok
1 : yeah cause i'm closer to the chalice
2 : mmhmm oh that goes over here. ok so that's one.
3 : yeah
4 : nope
3 : it's over here yeah.
2 : i'll save cliffs of abandon
4 : yeah it's in a prime spot.
2 : and
2 : umm
2 : i guess let's move here just in case.
4 : mm
4 : yeah i was gonna say that
4 : in case we would need to like give others away
2 : yup
1 : good card swapping
4 : yeah card swapping
3 : ok
3 : alright then umm
4 : oh you can
4 : save uh oh no that's you, just kidding
3 : yeah i mean i could go here and shore both of these up
2 : you're green
4 : oh wait what color are you? you're blue.
1 : that seems like waste cause i can take these two.
2 : ooo hold on sorry. i forgot my cards.
4 : yeah you can do that.
3 : oh ok
1 : so maybe go down here or something to garden
2 : here hold
2 : sorry i have to finish my, my turn, i forgot to, i forgot my cards sorry.
4 : uh oh
4 : oh look at that fire sweet.
1 : ah
3 : oh yeah
4 : oh then you can give her a fire.
4 : and then
2 : and then alright so we have
2 : silver gate
2 : which is here, tidal palace is gone. that's alright we just have to watch coral palace ooo oh ok and temple of the moon. that's ok.
4 : uh
1 : no
4 : uh oh
2 : ok
3 : alright
4 : so
4 : we
4 : we have to save these three
2 : we have to save yeah
4 : or we can't win.
2 : ok umm
3 : yeah
2 : do we want to use sandbag's uh oh never mind, we can't yet
4 : we can't
2 : right but now it's your turn
4 : darn we're so close
3 : ok
4 : i guess we
4 : chanced it too long?
3 : so
3 : i mean i
3 : i could definitely
2 : you should give me your fire.
4 : oh definitely
1 : you should use a sandbag first though
3 : oh yeah i can i will
2 : ok
3 : oh yeah you should use a sandbag
1 : that way you don't have to throw it away
2 : on oh true
3 : on this one
3 : cause that's the furthest away from all of us
2 : can we use temple of the sun?
4 : oh
4 : oh
1 : well maybe save this one then since it's closest to everyone
4 : that's true and
2 : but we can't we
2 : can we save them if they're in this pile? ok. oh ok.
3 : yeah, yeah as long as it's not a sinking tile
2 : ok
2 : good? ok
3 : yeah
3 : ok now i will give you that with one action
2 : ok
4 : yay
4 : this is great.
2 : perfect.
3 : alright
3 : and then i can just fly over here and save this or shore that one up unless you guys care about these
2 : no i don't care about either of those really
4 : ehh
3 : three
4 : yeah it's probably more important to save
4 : that one.
3 : wait before i do that
3 : oh yeah no that's mine
1 : yeah that's fine
3 : ok and then i'll shore
2 : and that's three
2 : yeah ok
3 : mmhmm
1 : ok
4 : ok
2 : don't forget this this time.
1 : we got a water's rising i'm sure.
3 : alright and then i have to discard this guy.
2 : no
1 : oh maybe not. nice.
2 : ok
3 : umm
3 : and then three
3 : bronze gate
3 : so over there
4 : oh
2 : ok
3 : cave of shadows
1 : hmm
3 : right here
4 : sounds so ominous
3 : dunes of deception
1 : yeah
3 : over here
2 : ok
4 : ok
4 : you get to get this one
1 : do you have to be on the tile first?
2 : you have to move is one of yours so that's one.
3 : you have to move yeah.
4 : just kidding
4 : one
3 : and then you capture it yeah
4 : two
4 : go it
4 : uh and three
4 : umm we don't care about saving that one right?
3 : umm
2 : i mean shore it up since you're there
3 : but you can cause like
3 : it's just nice if it's at the top of the pile.
1 : it's a good stepping point.
4 : yeah
3 : it's like a buffer.
4 : that's, that's a good point. what about that one since it's like
3 : yeah sure.
4 : more centrally located.
2 : yeah good. alright good work.
1 : yeah
4 : ok
1 : alright
4 : and now two
4 : i also could have moved to that one so that we could share whoever oh well.
3 : yeah
1 : mmhmm
4 : and these things alright we've got
2 : mmhmm
4 : misty marsh
4 : and howling garden
2 : got it.
4 : and cave of embers.
2 : alright perfect.
4 : yeah
2 : engineer
1 : alright
3 : ok
1 : so would it
3 : so we still want to save these two.
1 : ok
2 : mmhmm
4 : oh yeah actually
1 : one
1 : two
3 : i mean you from where you are unless you're planning you can do all and you can do that one and that one, right
2 : you could save both.
1 : i could save either of them.
4 : you could save either.
2 : mmhmm
1 : i can't cause i can't do diagonal.
3 : oh wait you're diagonal sorry.
1 : but i can go up here and save those three.
2 : i would
4 : could save both or he
2 : you could only do two at a time oh two times.
4 : oh
4 : oh
1 : yeah but i could do two and then one
3 : oh right right.
4 : that's true.
3 : yeah
2 : do that
3 : i mean
3 : i think it's helpful
1 : alright
1 : so i'll go there
1 : and then one
2 : that's three
1 : ok
1 : oh no
2 : water's rise
2 : alright
3 : wait we have to discard actually cause
1 : yup water's rise
3 : we have yeah
1 : yeah
1 : so
4 : oh
2 : umm
1 : discard the
1 : duplicate maybe?
2 : yeah i think it's o we have three in play that's good.
3 : yeah i think that makes sense.
4 : cause you have two
3 : we have like a good amount
1 : yup
4 : yeah
2 : ok
1 : alright so water's rise.
2 : i can shuffle these for you
1 : good thing we just saved all those tiles.
2 : ok
1 : one
1 : two
1 : three
1 : alright the howling garden is gone.
2 : ok
1 : cave of embers is flipped, oh sorry. yeah
1 : and the temple of the moon.
2 : ok
1 : is flipped.
2 : alright, so where am i at?
2 : alright so i'm gonnna take
3 : so you want to cash these in right?
2 : absolutely so i'm gonna have
2 : one move
3 : or
3 : maybe go to that one cause it's more centrally more centrally located
2 : ok one move, two move
1 : yeah you can swim
4 : you can
4 : do it when it's flooded right?
2 : mmhmm
3 : yeah
1 : yeah
4 : ok
2 : and then here's my third move. whoo
4 : yay
1 : nice
4 : alright
3 : alright
3 : right here
2 : then two cards
4 : so
4 : big decision are we gonna do chalice or?
4 : the other one, the moon, moon?
2 : well oh that's good we only do have to use
1 : where are you, you're closer to me so chalice
2 : one, two, three cave of shadows
1 : maybe it makes more sense cause he can get you the card too by lifting out to you.
3 : mmhmm
2 : ok cave of shadows is gone
2 : that doesn't count as a move i'm gonna swim
4 : oh
4 : swim
3 : oh
2 : dunes of deception is gone and cliffs of abandon is flooded.
3 : alright
4 : ok
2 : alrighty
1 : alright
3 : ok
3 : so
4 : wait sorry, which one are we going for?
1 : a chalice to me makes the most sense.
4 : chalice ok
1 : ss
3 : where are they?
3 : these are the only ones, this is the only one left?
1 : this is the chalice yeah
3 : ok
3 : umm
2 : we do have at least te both temples of the moon or temp for the
1 : although
1 : yeah that's true
4 : that's true
4 : and
4 : somebody's already on that one whose
2 : mmhmm
3 : mm
4 : you are?
1 : yeah
3 : i'm over here yeah but
4 : so
3 : so right now
4 : mm
1 : so he can lift you, do you have no you don't have one
3 : what
4 : no i only have chalices
1 : so that's me so he can lift
3 : do you want to use
3 : yeah i mean we could
4 : one, two, three, four, five. one, two three four.
3 : umm
3 : i could
1 : if you lift me
1 : to that tile.
3 : and then
1 : then on my next turn i give you one, she can give you one and then we'll get it.
2 : mmhmm
4 : you can share
2 : yeah that's good. let's do that.
4 : oh perfect. yeah.
1 : and then you just work on getting back to fool's landing.
2 : ok
3 : wait
4 : yeah
3 : but
3 : you want me to lift you there?
1 : yeah if you
3 : for what reason?
4 : as w
1 : so that
1 : ah
4 : he can share.
1 : so i can actually
1 : be there on my next turn.
2 : so you like you lift him there you give him, you give him one of your
1 : without wasting a helicopter lift.
3 : oh i see.
2 : your moons.
1 : although actually i suppose it
3 : cause i could just
3 : like
3 : as a pilot move to you
3 : and then give it to y give you cards if you want them.
4 : but we need somebody to be on that one.
3 : oh y we need to be down here.
2 : mmhmm
1 : that's
1 : yeah
3 : ok
1 : that way if it gets flooded you can shore it up on your turn.
3 : mmhmm
4 : yeah
4 : and it's close to that thing.
3 : sure
3 : so
1 : so you lift me down to the temple of the sun.
3 : alright
3 : which one are you, you're right here?
2 : the red
4 : red
1 : oh
1 : yeah
1 : red
2 : and that doesn't count as one of your moves.
3 : no
4 : oh right oh
2 : so you still have three
1 : ok
4 : so you could share now.
3 : yeah i could give you like cause we can
3 : change them right? or
1 : yeah or so, actually we can get this on the next round. uh if you give me a card
2 : you could use
3 : but then you're going to have to discard cards that's the only problem. oh yeah
1 : yeah i'll discard the chalice.
2 : you could use you could use two of your actions to give him both of your moon cards.
1 : and then on her next turn
3 : so i
4 : yeah cause we're done with the chalice.
2 : right now
1 : oh that's true
4 : oh and then he'd be ready to go on his turn
1 : ok
2 : yeah i would let's do that.
3 : yeah
2 : cause then we have at least
4 : yeah i like that
3 : but then you're gonna have to discard both of the
1 : yeah i can do that
2 : it doesn't matter but then we have three and we can all get to fool's landing and lift off.
4 : but yeah cause
4 : yeah
1 : yeah
3 : oh we just need three. ok so i'll just give you one
